Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't want to spoil anything\\, but suffice it to say my first feeling walking out of the theater was disappointment. And the longer I disgest The Last Jedi\\, the more disappointment I feel. It's a visually stunning movie so riddled with plot holes\\, bizarre choices\\, and complete failure to recognize it was the follow up to Episode VII and all the open questions of that movie that I can't get passed that. Star Wars or not.","true":true}
