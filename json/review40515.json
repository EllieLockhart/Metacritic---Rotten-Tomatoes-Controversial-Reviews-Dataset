Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the only time I've ever felt compelled to add a rating for a movie on this site. I felt I had to do it because of how terrible the movie was. After TFA(which I thought was just ok) I was very excited to see how they would reveal a lot of the questions that were left unanswered. Boy was I wrong\\, as this movie managed to throw all that out to the dumpster and decided to seemingly forget what had just happened in the previous movie. The plot was ridiculous( a slow speed space chase)\\, full of holes and things the made absolutely no sense. They managed to destroy what Luke Skywalker and many other things had been for decades. This is by far\\, the worst star wars to come out.","true":true}
