Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One Movie to rule them all\\, one Movie to find them\\, One Movie to bring them all and in the darkness RUIN all previous love for any and all things Star Wars. \\nThis movie is like a lover breaking up with you. Your left feeling empty\\, longing for what will never be again.","true":true}
