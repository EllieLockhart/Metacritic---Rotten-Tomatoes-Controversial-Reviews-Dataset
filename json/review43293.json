Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a film which was to quote a friend 'less than the sum of it's parts'. Everything is here but it's messy\\, ill thought out and more riddled with holes than a Swiss cheese. It has a progressive political agenda that is in equal parts patronising and dull. It plays havoc with the original trilogies legacy and may even be worse then some of the prequels\\, especially the revenge of the Sith which at least had a coherent narrative. The disparity between the critics view and the fans shows how ludicrously out of touch the critics are\\, and how little they seem to understand the excellence of the original trilogy.","true":true}
