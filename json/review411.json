Did The Evil Within not go the distance for you? Do you want to control the fates of every teen horror archetype in one night? If you have responded yes to the above\\, this game will be a very pleasing play through for you. The best thing about Until Dawn I saw is\\, anyone can play it\\, and play it very effectively. The difficulty is sub-par\\, so if you are hunting for a horror-esque game with a high-level challenge\\, check out Bloodbourne. Until Dawn grabs you from the shaking events on the prologue and doesn't let go for more than a minute to \\\"relieve\\\" your nerves\\, and then shakes you even harder. Something great Until Dawn did was bring the player into the horror experience. You\\, the player\\, have to progress through the dark\\, dreary abandoned mine shaft. As the game has a great deal of positives\\, there are negatives I experienced. The characters in the cast fell short for me\\, none of them were memorable to me and when(if) they died\\, I shrugged and kept on going. Another issue I had with the game was how badly the story was told\\, lore wise. The game would give you facts about an event and not five minutes later would completely refute it. I understand the mystery aspect but as an avid mystery genre fanatic\\, giving the player clues to connect and losing the relevance of key \\\"clues\\\" I found through the game was really irritating. As a game with a new age horror experience\\, this game is worth a play through. Rent it on gamefly if you are able to...The replay-ability is abysmal and you will not like hearing the same dialogue and jump scares more than once.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
