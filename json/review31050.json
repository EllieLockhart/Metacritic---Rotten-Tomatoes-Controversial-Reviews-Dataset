Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So heartbreaking what a POS. Disney has no idea what they doing and the people who made this should be ashamed for calling this cannon. Last Star Wars move I ever see in the theaters. It\u2019s not new casts fault they act fine but they are devolved in a way that makes them hard to coney to their motivation. I simply do not care about where it goes anymore. life long fan done. Critics wake up! #disneyisnotcannon","true":true}
