Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love the Star Wars saga and I was excited for this instalment after The Force Awakens. Sadly this film was a big let down. Messy plot\\, unbelievable characterisation and many unanswered questions (where are the Knights of Ren? Who is Snoke? Why is Kylo Ren drawn to the dark side? Reys parents? Rey's Jedi training? ). Perhaps my expectations were too high to begin with\\, i dunno. Visually however it looked stunning! I must say and the sound\/music was breathtaking. Unfortunately this was the weakest Star Wars instalment in my opinion and I doubt i'll be visiting a galaxy far far away next time.","true":true}
