Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just want to start off saying that I am a huge Star Wars fan and was so excited to see this latest installment. I have loved all episodes before this as well as Rogue One\\, The Clone Wars\\, Rebels and have enjoyed getting into many of the books. And while there were some good parts of TLJ\\, there were some glaringly bad things that were hard to get past. Not only that\\, but I was in such a bad mood after seeing it that first showing on Thursday\\, that it lingered with me all day Friday. I felt like my guts were ripped out. I saw it again Saturday and Sunday\\, and it was even harder to watch. I didn't hate it. But I feel Rian Johnson and Disney have really jumped the shark here. They've left many of us gutted and disappointed. I\\, for one\\, just hope JJ Abrams can salvage episode IX and right this wrong. I'll reserve final judgment until then. But\\, right now\\, I can honestly say that this didn't feel like a Star Wars Movie. It was a 2 hour low speed car chase that either didn't answer the questions raised in TFA or let us down with answers that were weak at best. And\\, what they did to Luke's character is almost unforgivable. I really feel bad that our beloved Mark Hamill had to go through that. There were good parts that were enjoyable and entertaining\\, to be sure. But the parts I had a problem with have really left a bad taste in my mouth.","true":true}
