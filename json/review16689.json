{"101487":137989,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never thought I'd say this\\, but PLEASE give me the Phantom Menace again\\, as bad as the prequels were they never made me extremely mad. There's so much wrong with Last Jedi that it's crazy\\, SO MUCH!! If you liked this movie then you're a total moron\\, only a diehard fanboy or a Disney shill could like this. It's complete & utter dogcrap. The reviews here at least prove that when it comes to Disney we can't trust a single word from critics\\, they're just complete shills. \\n\\nThere's so much wrong with this movie\\, all the nonsense new force powers that would have been really useful 6 movies ago. Leia flying\\, I think Sidious could really have used that ability in Return of the Jedi\\, total garbage. \\n\\nUsing light speed to get through a planets shields like they did in Force Awakens\\, they could have really used that in Return of the Jedi\\, they wouldn't have to waist half the movie running around with Ewoks. \\n\\nThen using Light Speed as a weapon?!?! That REALLY could have been useful 6 movies ago\\, that could have been used to take down the Death Star\\, this is just horrendous writing\\, with absolutely NO CARE about canon. \\n\\nRey is a COMPLETE Mary Sue\\, anyone who says different is a complete & utter moron\\, she picks up a lightsaber for the first time & defeats a Skywalker (Kylo)\\, who's trained since childhood as a Jedi\\, it's ridiculous. It took Luke 3 movies to gain the power to beat Vader\\, in Empire Vader beats him & cuts off his hand even after months of training with Yoda. \\n\\nWhy on earth should the Rebels be afraid of the First Order now? There's no reason\\, Rey has already beat Kylo\\, so where's the conflict? \\n\\nLuke could see the good in Vader\\, the second most evil person in the galaxy\\, someone who killed his mentor\\, someone responsible for the deaths of billions\\, but was going to kill Kylo because he was going a little off course?!? \\n\\nAnd Snoke\\, the big bad guy built up to look badass\\, the only interesting new character at all\\, they just killed him in a ridiculous way in the second movie?!?! All the hours I spent looking at stuff about his origins & now they kill him without ANYTHING!! The writers are pure dogcrap\\, they haven't got a clue how to write a good character. It's so bad that it's driving me nuts. \\n\\nAnd now they've killed absolutely EVERY interesting character\\, there's no one left that's in any way interesting. I'm finished with Star Wars\\, I won't even watch the third movie\\, I'll watch the continuation to Rogue One\\, as that movie was great. \\n\\nThen all the SJW bullcrap\\, animal cruelty & the usual SJW propaganda\\, it's insane that Disney are incapable of making a movie without pushing their postmodern bullcrap. I hate them with every fibre in my body. \\n\\nReys backstory\\, so now anyone can be as powerful as Skywalkers\\, even though we've spent 6 movies saying that Skywalkers are the MOST powerful Jedi in the Universe\\, no Jedi will EVER be so powerful. But here we have Mary Sue\\, a nobody\\, Queen feminist powerhouse. Total bullcrap. \\n\\nThere's so much more wrong with this movie but it'll take me all day to type it out\\, SO MUCH WRONG!! It's so horrendous that it's insane\\, in order to like this you have to be a crazy person or just a complete fanboy who sucks off Star Wars  all day\\, who can't hear anything negative about Star Wars whatsoever. \\n\\nThe movie is beyond terrible\\, I hate Disney & I hate all the critics who've given it a score above 90%\\, that truly shows you how corrupt these critics are\\, I wouldn't be surprised if they're all on the Disney payroll\\, I can't see any other reason for that score\\, they're nothing but shills.  The real score is the user score & that's even VERY generous.","true":true}
