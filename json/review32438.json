Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is practically a religion these days! Keeping the mystery after all this time\\, living up to the originals while still doing something new and fun - it's a tall order\\, and they did it! A great movie and worthy of the canon... and my anticipation for the finale just keeps building!","true":true}
