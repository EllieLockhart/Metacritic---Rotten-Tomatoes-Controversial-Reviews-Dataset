Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good movie\\, but not a great movie!! Unfortunately the movie makers are focusing on being PC and are forgetting what the real world audience wamt to see!!","true":true}
