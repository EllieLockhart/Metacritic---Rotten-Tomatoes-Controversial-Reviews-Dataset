Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a let down after the brilliantly made Rogue One. Although I can see where the director was trying to take the story here\\, he fails. What he did to Luke Skywalkers character was terrible and there was to much attempt at comedy.","true":true}
