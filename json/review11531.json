Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible pacing. What started out as probably a well written movie was killed in post. No world building\\, no character development\\, failed to illicit a single emotional response. There were entire plot lines that should have been killed off to allow for some epic star wars esc. shots\\, of which there was none. All the progress they made with fans with \\\"Force Awakens\\\" was totally lost. Every character I loved in Episode 7 was totally blah in this film. Kathleen Kennedy\\, Rian Johnson\\, Disney\\, Abrams - Good job\\, none of you.","true":true}
