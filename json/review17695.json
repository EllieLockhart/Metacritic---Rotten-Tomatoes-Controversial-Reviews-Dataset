Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It breaks the guideline of the original movies throughout the film. I found that there were very powerful moments with some characters. Admittedly there are two points that I can recall that take you out of it. I think this is because it was just poorly done. If you were to read these parts on paper they would be epic.","true":true}
