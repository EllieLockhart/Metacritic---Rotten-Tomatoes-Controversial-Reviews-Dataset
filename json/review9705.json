Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good Sc-Fi movie\\, awful Star Wars movie:\\nPositive:\\n-Yoda more like in the original triology\\n-one space battle with B17 alike bombers (liked their concept)\\n-Casino planet ( a place created like Timothy Zahn or George Lucas would)\\n\\nNegative:\\n-CHILDREN\\n-No realism (fighter mounted lasers shoot straight through shields)\\n-Leia = Hillary Clinton\\n-Rebel officers only feminist women\\n-Leia flies through space?\\n-No unpredictable plot twist... (only bs twists)\\n-No appearence of: Old characters (when not even mentioned like admiral ackbar... and where is Lando?)\\, Old species (One Mon Calamari and one Sullustan\\, nothing more?)\\, old planets (no cult place or \\\"legends\\\" place\\n-Force wrong described (Luke felt when Ben Kenobi died or Alderaans death or ANakin and his mother--- and then Luke didn't feel anything about Han? Also Luke disconnected with force but then the force is everywhere and always?\\n-Plot holes\\n-No fan theories\/ theories at all: Snoke just dead? Reys parents? ...?\\n-Ren and Rey just faceless just not reasonable\\n-Childish gags","true":true}
