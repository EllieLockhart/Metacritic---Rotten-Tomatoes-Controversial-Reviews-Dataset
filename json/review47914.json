Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I can understand the movie divides some fans\\, at the same time it is somewhat unexpected coming from such a great film.Not only was it visually stunning\\, there were moments that had me at the edge of my seat\\, and others that tugged on my heartstrings. It was easily the best Star Wars movie since Empire\\, and was a great send off for the Jedi.","true":true}
