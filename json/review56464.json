Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The family & I saw Star Wars and all of us were less the impressed. Great action scenes and moments that are almost chill worthy but the story could not have been more safe. I am not so sure JJ Abram is the right guy to oversee this series. Remember the last show of LOST? The viewers theories of that show took the story in far more interesting places than the limited mind of it's creator (JJ Abrams) and after 2 main Star Wars movies that he has oversight of\\, I think it's evident we are in for more of the same. The trailer led us to believe there would be far more interesting plot twists with this movie than what there are. Luke's line \\\"This is not going to go as you think\\\" is right. There was nothing to be surprised by. Entertaining for sure\\, and moments of engagement but not original\\, nor does it significantly develop the storyline of the franchise.","true":true}
