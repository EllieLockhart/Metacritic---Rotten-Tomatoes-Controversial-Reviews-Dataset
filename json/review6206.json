Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has killed Star Wars. This newly rebooted crap I've dubbed Disney Wars is not my Star Wars. The acting is second rate. The plots are full of idiocy. Even Yoda returns to blow some shit up!","true":true}
