Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The people who don't like this movie clearly don't get the history of Star Wars beyond the movies\\, and clearly don't get how storytelling works. This was the most outstanding Star Wars yet. If all you expect is action and that kind of mumbo jumbo then you won't get this film. This is the strongest character development everyone has ever done for Star Wars. Not to sound critical of opinions\\, but you're clearly not getting the story or the way it was going all along after Force Awakens if you don't like this film. True Star Wars fans who know the history and know the series will appreciate this one!","true":true}
