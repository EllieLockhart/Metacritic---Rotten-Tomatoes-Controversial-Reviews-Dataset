Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is filled with plot holes\\, is lack of consistent universe\\, has legendary characters totally different personalities from the original trilogy...\\n\\nThe first 3 episodes were just to fill the blanks in episodes 4\\, 5 and 6 and this trilogy should have been as legendary as 4\\, 5 and 6.\\n\\n7 was filled with unrelatable characters and now. Rey is the most Mary Sue in all movie sector. She was perfect at everything\\, liked and trusted by everyone easily\\, had great powers with no explanation...\\n\\nIn 8\\, i hoped there would be some explanation all for this. Why does she know how to fix hyperdrive? where does her powers come from? how come he learned all these powers without being trained\\n\\nAnd guess what? There was no answer. Also\\, the given answer is not answering at all.\\n\\nMark Hamill risked his everything for a tiny bit everything for his father because he saw a little bit good in him. But when he saw Kylo\\, he tried to kill him in sleep? THIS IS NOT LUKE!!!!\\n\\nAnd Rey took 3 lessons only for 2 days! This is no training! This isn't even an intro to training! And who wrote the lessons? 5 years old kid? \\n\\nCrying out loud\\, listen\\, in space where you can travel with FTL\\, you wont chase anything. you use FTL to get in front of them\\, cut them and toast them from two sides. The great\\, builders of planetwide deathstar couldn't think of it?\\n\\nThis\\, episode 8 is so much worse and gives no hope for the episode 9.","true":true}
