Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well...I went and seen it today. And I\u2019m a little confused on where all of this is going. I really wanted to like it\\, and I do...and then I don\u2019t. lol! It\u2019s all over the place for me. It had its good moments\\, then it got lost again. I never felt I bonded with any of the characters. At least not any of the new ones. The special affects are always amazing\\, but the story line was a little blah for me. ","true":true}
