Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film totally surprised me with some of its choices and revelations\\, the fact that Rey's parents are nobodies makes total sense. Why do people want her to be related to one of the main characters? It is ludicrous to think that in a galaxy spanning story one family have all the agency. Adam Driver totally nails his performance as Kylo Ren and the scene with him and Rey in the throne room just might be my favourite scene of the entire series. (Followed very closely by Luke's standoff with Kylo) Craig was visually unique and a nice change from the desert or snow planets that we're so used to seeing by now. I can't wait to see Roan Johnson's standalone trilogy and I think episode IX couldn't have a stronger set up. This film has paved the way for a resurgence of the Jedi order and a full on war with the First Order. Roll on 2019.","true":true}
