Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the best of the newer Star Wars movies. This one gives you something more in the best way. The Force Awakens was enjoyable as well but purely runs on nostalgic value. However\\, this installment is much more fleshed out and contains more captivating scenes that will have you further invested in the new characters just as much as the classic ones.","true":true}
