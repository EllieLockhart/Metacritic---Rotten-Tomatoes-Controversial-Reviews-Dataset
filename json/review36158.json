Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was completely insulting to an audience who loved the set up and the tone of 'The Force Awakens'.  The overly CGI scenes and characters\\, the pointless silly nonsense like the leprechaun characters\\, and turning previously serious moments into goofball comedy like Finn squirting medical fluid everywhere completely sucked me out of the experience.  It felt like a collegehumor parody.  The new movies done in the style of the terrible prequels!\\n\\nThe force got overextended (flying through space\\, projecting onto another planet) and the plot was all over the place. I simply will not ever watch this again.","true":true}
