Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion\\, but honestly\\, I cannot figure out why viewers are bashing on this movie. Whether or not you like this movie is completely up to you and I do not mean to judge this. However\\, many of the critical reasons for objectively calling this a \\\"bad\\\" movie in other reviews seem very misguided. \\n\\nThis is the best Star Wars film to date. In addition to being incredibly fun to watch\\, it is strikingly well put together. Even if this film were not Star Wars\\, it would still be a fantastic movie worthy of watching two\\, three\\, four\\, or more times. People complained that the Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope (to which I also disagree). The Last Jedi\\, however\\, still pays homage to the original trilogy while developing a unique plot and characters that will repeatedly surprise viewers. \\n\\nMany reviewers have also said that there was too much humor. While\\, again\\, this is a matter personal opinion\\, I believe that humor is done tastefully in The Last Jedi and enhances both the movie and Star Wars as a whole. Life is not all serious. We both cry AND laugh. People make jokes (especially in tough times like war to cope). The humor in The Last Jedi makes the characters more human. Also\\, Star Wars has become so big at this point that it cannot afford to take itself seriously all the time. Humor shows a self-awareness of the series and provides a self-referential attitude. The film acknowledges the phenomena that is is\\, adding a new layer of engagement\\, and thus\\, enjoyment for viewers. Amidst all the high fantasy and hype\\, the film feels grounded because of its self awareness and humor. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is not all humor though (in fact\\, most is not humor) as it provides a level of complexity that no Star Wars film (and few films at all for that matter) have done to date. In one moment we are laughing\\, but in the next we are enthralled by action\\, drama\\, and the intricacies of humanity seen in characters. The Last Jedi will awe and overwhelm viewers with its ability to capture power and emotion. The conflict presented is this film is unparalleled by any other Star Wars movie.\\n\\nI have never posted a movie review online but genuinely felt moved to upon seeing a audience score that does a great injustice to this film. In a world that is often frustrating\\, sometimes we need a film with emotional complexity that is also a joy to watch. The Last Jedi is that movie. Thank you to all those who worked to give us something to smile about.","true":true}
