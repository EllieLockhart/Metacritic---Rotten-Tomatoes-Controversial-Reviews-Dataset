Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie exceeded all of my expectations\\, it is without a doubt the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. It \\,however\\, did make the prequels more enjoyable for me to watch since I can't bring myself to sit through this dumpster fire again. Congratulations to Rian Johnson for  ruining the sequel trilogy and doing serious damage to the brand. I feel sorry for Ron Howard having to follow this hack. It's difficult to drum up interest in new films when the most recent one was a steaming pile of refuse. IThere are so many things to dislike about this movie that I will only name a few : The racist\\,stereotypical depiction of Poe Dameron\\, turning Finn into a court jester and the sexist depiction of Leia and Holdo making them the worst military commanders in the history of  cinema .","true":true}
