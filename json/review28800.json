Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rain Johnson obviously does not like Star Wars\\, and also hates men - particularly white men.  This entire movie is infected with SJW hate speech and is basically just a vehicle for demeaning and marginalizing white males.  Luke is turned from one of the greatest characters in movie history into a worthless loser.  Rey is the ultimate Mary-Sue\\, so much so that is makes a complete mockery of all the Star Wars movies before it.  The plot holes in this movie are inexcusable\\, as well as the complete waste of 35 minutes of runtime on a preachy SJW leftist soap-box side-plot that literally nobody enjoyed.  Just an awful movie\\, and a disgrace to this movie franchise.","true":true}
