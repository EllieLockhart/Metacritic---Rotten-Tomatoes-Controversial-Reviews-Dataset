I didn't read any of the leaks that dropped prior and experienced this game pure.\r\rThe Last Of Us was nearly a life changing experience\\, it stands seven years later as the game that has stuck with me the longest and in the most positive way.\r\rI'm still in disbelief over the dumpster fire this sequel turned out to be.  I genuinely hated every minute of playing through the last half of the game.  I just wanted it to be over.  I made myself keep playing hoping against reality that it would come together eventually.  It did not. I finished it two days prior to this writing and I'm still a little emotionally numb and disappointed over the whole experience.  My only regret is that I bought digital and that I can't trade it in.\r\rOutside of the terrible story and atomic bomb story structure\\, many of the chapters seemed to drag on far longer than necessary.  There are far too many incredibly predictable encounters and cut-scenes. Overall the game became extremely repetitive and hard to play through.  A far cry from the original.\r\rGraphically the game is stunning for any console and the physics are the best I've seen in game.\r\rThe 'critic' reviews on this site must have played an alternate version of this game\\, or perhaps didn't play it at all.\r\rDo yourself a favor\\, if you cherish the story of Joel and Ellie\\, stay far away from The Last Of Us Part II.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
