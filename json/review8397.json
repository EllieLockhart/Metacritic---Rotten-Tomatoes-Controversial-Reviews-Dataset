Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Few films have as lofty of expectations as the latest Star Wars films have and so far since the Disney takeover of LucasFilm\\, those films have delivered. This is the first stumble. I have to agree with the early dissatisfaction of Mark Hamill who lamented what was done with his character\\, Luke Skywalker. Now we know and it's not pretty. And with an over reliance on blockbuster cliches while being filled with plot holes so big the Millennium Falcon could fly through them\\, The Last Jedi is far too long and overstuffed with tonally awkward jokes to resonate. The force is not so strong with this one.","true":true}
