The new characters are fine but the writing is poor and the characters are wasted.Sadly eveything else is awesome from sound to graphics to gameplay.  Amazing stuff. But the story and focus and pace and the feeling you have when it's all over ....is unpleasant.  The game makes you feel ill.  Sad...And angry but at the devs...not the clever writing.Buy it on sale and decide for yourself. 6\/10 maybe 7 but not at full price and not when the devs keep behaving like spoilt children.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
