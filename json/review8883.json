Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the people who are upset by this movie:  relax\\, and may the Force be with you.  This is the epitome of a middle movie in a trilogy\\, and I like Johnson's approach to the complex natures for the major characters.  Where Chapter iV was about black-and-white good vs. evil\\, this feels more like real relationships and the how people face their failures.  I trust that Abrams will bring this story home with a flourish in the next movie and people will appreciate how well The Last Jedi made this a deeper story with richer characters.","true":true}
