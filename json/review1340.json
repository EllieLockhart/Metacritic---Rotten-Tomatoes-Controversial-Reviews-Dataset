Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Are you kidding me\\, this movie makes no sense\\, I have been waiting since ROTJ to see Luke kick some butt\\, and Rian turns Luke into a giant crybaby EMO\\, also the slow speed space chase?? since when has gas been a factor in star wars? The casino Mission to find the code breaker? and you kill off snoke before we even know who he is or was?? it was like a bad dream come true\\, Please don't let rian do any more star wars two thumbs down.","true":true}
