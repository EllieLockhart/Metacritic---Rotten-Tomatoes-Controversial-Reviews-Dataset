Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People are just mad that this movie is very different. Ignore the salty fanboys. Go see this movie. There are a lot of dumb parts\/ pointless parts but there are also a lot of cool parts. Not the best in the series but certainly not the worst. Does not deserve 44%","true":true}
