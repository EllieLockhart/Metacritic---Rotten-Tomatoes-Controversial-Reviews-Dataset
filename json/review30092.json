Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sad. I'm a huge fan of Star Wars since forever. The Force Awakens was somehow a disappointement\\, but at least it was not bad. The Last Jedi is one of the most WORST MOVIE EVER. It was not only a bad Star Wars movie\\, it was also a bad science-fiction movie\\, a bad fantasy movie\\, bad action movie... Bad scenario\\, bad characters (yes\\, Rian Johnson managed to all of them. i mean\\, even Luke and Leia!!! -Kylo Ren was better on this one\\, strangely-)\\, some illogical sequence of events... I was almost crying in the theater\\, because I was so shocked at how much a joke was this movie. A Star Wars movie! Can't believe it. I'm pissed.","true":true}
