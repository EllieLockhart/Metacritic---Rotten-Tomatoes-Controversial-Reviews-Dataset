Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi takes so many risks and is drastically different than anything else we\u2019ve seen before. It swings big and hits in almost every aspect. Finn\u2019s arc is undoubtedly the weakest part\\, but there\u2019s so much else the movie does right\\, it\u2019s difficult for this one part to knock the entire product that much. Performances are solid across the board. Action is great and grand.","true":true}
