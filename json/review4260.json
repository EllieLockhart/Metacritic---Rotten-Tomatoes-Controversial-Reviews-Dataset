Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars movie. In a poor effort to be original\\, the director ignored everything that made Star Wars a timeless epic. It forced ideologies such as vegetarianism\\, had stupid and slap in your face subplots such as the casino royals\\, and had out of place direction ie Leia's flying in space when unconscious and freezing in space and the First Order General's opening monologue. There was multiple times in the theatre when people would look at each other stunned by the stupidity. If you remove the Star Wars elements and lore out of the equation\\, the movie is horrible as a stand alone movie and one that people would not pay to see.","true":true}
