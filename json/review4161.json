Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Burn in hell you money-oriented\\, classic SW movie destroyers. I am talking to you Disney\\, Rian and all the paid Critics. It is not a hack\\, people just don't like the big mess you've done. The hacked reviews are those 92%\\, and the hack are coins engraved with Mickey Mouse on them. I hope no one buy your porg toys\\, and no one pay you to see this abomination called The Last Jedi.","true":true}
