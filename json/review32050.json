Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**Spoilers!**\\nI am a huge fan of Star Wars and I'm shocked how terrible this film is. Disney is slowly destroying a legacy. Here is a small list of the issues: \\n\\n1. The Death of Snoke - Really? Just kill him off without giving any more info on his background? Why build him up so quickly kill him off?\\n2. The Death of Luke\\, Luke's Legacy\\, Luke's Behavior - Luke Skywalker was not in this movie. I have no idea who this 'Luke' imposter was.\\n3. Finn & Rose's Subplot - Added nothing to the film\/story.\\n4. The Casino Scene - Again\\, added nothing to the film\/story. \\n5. Rey's Parents are Nobody - They built up Rey's background as a point of interest in 7 just to confirm in 8 she is a nobody.\\n6. Death & Return of Leia - Superman anyone? \\n7. Death of Phasma - Again\\, another pointless character that could've been awesome.\\n8. Comedy Relief - There was way too much of this and at the wrong times. \\n9. Dropped Force Awakens Subplots.\\n10. SO many plot holes.\\n\\nThere are more issues with this story\/film\\, but I'm not going to waste any more time. It's almost as if Geroge Lucas was involved in the making of Episode 8. It's like we're reliving Episode 1 all over again.","true":true}
