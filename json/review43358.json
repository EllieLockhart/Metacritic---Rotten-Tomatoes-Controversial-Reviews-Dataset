Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a huge let down.  Change direction immediately.  After the Force Awakens this movie seems lands with a thud.  Jokes are out of place and off colour\\, and main characters  behave completely out of character for who they are.","true":true}
