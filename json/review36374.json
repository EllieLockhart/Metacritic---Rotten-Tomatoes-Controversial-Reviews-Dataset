Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The More I think about this movie the more I realize how much it sucked.  I have no idea where they are going to go for the next movie\\, which I would be fine with for know if this movie was good.\\n\\nFrom the scene with princess lea flying through space\\, to Finn and rose freeing the horse dog things\\, this movie was awful throughout two of its three plots. The thing is\\, two of the three could have been avoided by laura dern saying\\, \\\"calm down\\, we have a plan\\\" instead of\\, \\\"you need to have hope even when you can't see it.\\\"  Also\\, using luke skywalker for cheap jokes ruined what could have been an interesting plot with him rejecting the force because of kilo ren.\\n\\nThe only interesting parts of this movie were when Rey and Kilo Ren were together. They had chemistry on screen and were interesting to watch. Also\\, I liked Benicio Del Toro in this. But as a whole\\, not a good movie.","true":true}
