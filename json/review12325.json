Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am sorry to say this was all true\\, a movie strong on Harry Potter and short on Star Wars\\, as my wife summed it up. A combination of bad samurai memes\\, stupid and pointless visual jokes and a sequence with the \\\"Dark Side\\\" which was all done with mirrors and no plot line. So disappointing.","true":true}
