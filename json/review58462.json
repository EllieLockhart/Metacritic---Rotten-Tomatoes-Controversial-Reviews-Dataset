Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the stars. What an incredible addition to the Star Wars universe. It must have been very difficult to come up with a film that followed The Force Awakens since it was so similar to A New Hope without remaking The Empire Strikes Back. Well... they did it and I loved it. I'm a little confused reading some other people's reviews because they say that this was essentially a remake. Empire Strikes Back ended on a cliffhanger and clearly led to the events that would take place in Return of the Jedi. It would be impossible to make a Return of the Jedi type film after the events that took place in this movie. In fact\\, if the previous film narrowed the scope of where Star Wars could go\\, this film expanded it. I loved seeing Luke in a new light at a different time in his life and see the force attuned characters interact with the force in a new way. I also really enjoyed the other characters. I'm very excited to see it again and to see the final film in the trilogy.","true":true}
