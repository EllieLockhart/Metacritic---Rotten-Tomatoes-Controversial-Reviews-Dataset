Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just to help share that the people who don't like this movie only wanted to see a repeat of episode 5. Rian Johnson took risks and tried to add to the saga rather than duplicating a familiar storyline. There may be slightly too much humor and Kylo Ren still acts more like a moody teenager\\, but overall this is a great addition to the collection. ","true":true}
