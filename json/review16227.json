Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm no one to tell you what to favor or to make you think I'm a way\\, but I just want to give my honest opinion out there to anyone who's open to looking at others thoughts in a topic. Star Wars the last Jedi lacks so much\\, the action\\, the length\\, the story it really tries to hard to shuffle everything around. It's 2 and 38 minutes! It really felt like 5 hours but that's my opinion. I am extremely agree the humor is true it really gives your a laugh! Anyone who would like to go watch it\\, love it hate it\\, it's up to you. For me defiantly not the movie I was hoping for .","true":true}
