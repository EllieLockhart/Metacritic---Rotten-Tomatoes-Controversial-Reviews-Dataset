Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unforgettable story and felt smallnwith only 6 locations in the entire film. Luke's character didn't follow from the original instead becoming a weak minded jedi best known for a padawan. Kylo Ren definitely stole the show and was the best part of this movie. Rey didn't make any mistakes again and still had all the answers and knew exactly where to go to save the day. Oh and NO LIGHTSABER BATTLE NOT ONE!!!!!! ","true":true}
