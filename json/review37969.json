Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The single worst Star Wars film ever to disgrace a cinema screen with it's unworthy projection. The plot holes alone are damnation enough\\, to say nothing of the insidious and downright insulting attitude clearly visible in the films writing. A more clumsy attempt at \\\"subversive\\\" you would be hard pressed to find without venturing too far into literal fan-fiction.\\n\\nThis movie isn't just sophomoric posturing\\, asinine eye-candy beyond redemption- it's an outrage. Heads should roll for this. _Roll_","true":true}
