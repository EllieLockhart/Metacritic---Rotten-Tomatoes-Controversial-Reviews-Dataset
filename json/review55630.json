Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure why this is getting such bad reviews. If you are a fan of Star Wars\\, action\\, and sci-fi  you will love this movie. If you were expecting a lot of character back story and answers\\, Star Wars isn't the universe for you. That's how it's always been.","true":true}
