Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have a hard time with this film due to being a life long star wars fan. While watching it and being engrossed in the film\\, I actually enjoyed it (minus space vegas and Finn) However once leaving the theater I could not help but be sad at the fact that any and all expectations I had (mainly for Luke) were just not fulfilled. I understand why the story was taken in that direction\\, but in my opinion it should have been saved for the third film.","true":true}
