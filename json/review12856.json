Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't know a multi-billion dollar company could fail so hard. This movie is horrible and was nothing like star wars. It seemed like some netflix trash movie and no one's ever heard of... but it was star wars?! Common\\, they could have put at least a little work into it.","true":true}
