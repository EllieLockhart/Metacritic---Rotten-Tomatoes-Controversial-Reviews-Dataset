Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dear Disney and Fail Kathleen Kennedy\\, You are taking G.L.'s Legacy and slowly eroding it.  Its not that the movie is over all bad. But you are making movies for the critics. Not the key demographic that goes to see it 5 times while buying all the toys and comics.  You killed off the Star Wars Universe most favorite character by a Land SLIDE in Luke Skywalker.  You made less money then the force awakens. You paid 4 billion dollars.  You won't even get too a billion in sales for this movie and after you are done paying for the cost of the movie and marketing and giving the movie houses their cut you are not taking very much as  profit.  My advice is stop making movies for the critics and make them for the fans. (I'm not saying there were not great parts in the movie but if we are dealing in black and white I'm pretty sure a 48% fan rating says what needs to be said)  Please try harder","true":true}
