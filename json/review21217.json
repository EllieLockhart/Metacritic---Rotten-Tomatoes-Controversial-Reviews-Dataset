Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched the original Star Wars in 1977\\, I am also a fan of the prequels which I believe it could be done better\\, all of them are part of my gratifiying movie life experience including Episode VII and Rogue One. After read to some the reviews made by moviegoers and some videos in YouTube\\, I can add some aspects not mentioned which I considered crucial for my 2 star review\\, first the Casino scene which I considered stupid and lame\\, it supposed to be a galaxy far away with different culture and life style\\, it was like I was watching Star Trek and not a Star Wars movie. secondly\\, the score very poor\\, it was like there was not score at all. And third and last\\, the continuation of the story was totally disappointed without anything that can remember and desire to watch again\\, an episode outside the Star Wars saga. Many like me we expect a better well made Episode IX\\, to fill completely our expectations to worth appreciate this new trilogy.","true":true}
