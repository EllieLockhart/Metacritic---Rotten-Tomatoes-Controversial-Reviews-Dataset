Combat scenarios are intense\\, open-ended and dynamic; enemies have a great variety and require various skillful tactics to defeat. Player freedom\\, from the settings to gameplay approach\\, is high. The soundtrack is top-notch\\, and music is masterfully deployed to match the mood of every scene. Excellent visuals\\, gameplay\\, sound and world design are only the start. There\u2019s also some amazing blockbuster-level action set pieces and top-notch production values.What really matters\\, why I game\\, is for the experience. After lots of gaming\\, I admit I stopped caring about them for a while. Games just started to feel too familiar. This rekindled that fire a thousand times over\\, by making me feel every single emotion under the sun. Anger\\, horror\\, shock\\, loss\\, fear\\, joy\\, giddiness\\, disbelief\\, awe\\, sadness\\, excitement\\, every single thing. Over the 3 or so days I spent with this game\\, doing little else outside of sleeping and eating\\, I kept marveling at these emotions it was eliciting\\, the expansive and twisted and difficult storyline\\, the amazing characters\\, the brilliant way fully-realized characters were opposed to each other\\, the way the game made you do things that made your skin crawl. On the horror side\\, there were so so so many moments of intense adrenaline. On the storytelling side\\, I\u2019ve rarely seen a story as moving and as difficult as this\\, explored in a way that only video games can realize. This is gaming as an artform\\, and Naughty Dog has secured my loyalty for life.In the interest of keeping this spoiler-free\\, I don\u2019t wanna say much else\\, except buy this game. Play it with an open mind. It is dark and messy and **** and some parts will drain you\\, anger you\\, make you question a lot. Every aspect of it is working towards telling one of the most powerful experiential stories I have ever witnessed. As a software engineer by day\\, and writer by night\\, both parts of me feel elated to the highest level for having experienced this. Games of this quality rarely occur.. The Last of Us Part 2 is without equal\\, a generation-defining masterpiece\\, and my favorite game of all time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
