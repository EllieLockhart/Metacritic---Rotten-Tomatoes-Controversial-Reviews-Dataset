Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its a good movie. Calm down. People whine and cry about these movies being a \\\"RIPOFF\\\" of the original... I can see how people would call it a ripoff... except its not\\, its an homage to the original\\, a very SAFE movie for DISNEY. crazy right? a company wanting money for their biggest IP.","true":true}
