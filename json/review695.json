Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An amazing and rich movie that will ultimately be remembered as the brilliant piece of art that it is. Brilliant cast\\, intriguing character choices\\, amazing visuals and the final scene between Luke and Kylo stand out for me. Loved it notwithstanding a few minor gripes and cringy scenes. Watched it twice already and plan on watching again. And it's time that those who loved the movie post more reviews and make sure credit is given where due. I\\, for one\\, want to  see more of this kind of smart filmmaking in the future.","true":true}
