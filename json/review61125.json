What everyone came for was an emotional rollercoaster\\, for which the bar set for the gaming industry in Part I. There has been significant differences of opinion on the direction the studio took the plot\\, and sadly not all of it polite\\, but I for one found the story tugged at my emotions just as much if not more than the original. It is darker and more brutal than Part I\\, with less down time for your emotions to level off\\, and no game has ever left me as shell shocked upon completion or stayed on my mind for so long. Second time round I found additional moments\\, and the epilogue may have resonated even more after so long in this world\\, where I could stay for many more hours.\r\rThere was undoubtedly a 'handbrake turn' halfway through which threw me for a while\\, and it evidently hasn't worked for everyone\\, but I found that it was a fresh direction and used the gameplay to tell the story more effectively than a couple of cutscenes would have. We see many characters make decisions which may frustrate the player\\, but in my opinion worked within the character that had been constructed in the game.\r\rSome side characters could have used fleshing out more\\, along with some other aspects of the lore in general\\, but at circa thirty hours as it is I can understand the balance that Naughty Dog came to.\r\rOverall\\, a nigh unbeatable experience that for me has set the bar for the next generation to surpass. The story will not work for all\\, and I hope that fans can debate in the appropriate manner\\, but I will take this over a rehashed Part I\\, predictable trope\\, or absolute black and white\\, any day.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
