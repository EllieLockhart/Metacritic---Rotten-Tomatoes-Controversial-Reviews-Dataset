Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can imagine the pitch meeting for this: \\\"How about a cross between Star Wars\\, the Ghost Busters reboot\\, and an Adam Sandler movie?  The kids will love it!\\\"\\n\\nIt was cringy.  Half a star for the fine acting by Mark Hamill and Adam Driver\\, but I feel so sorry for them about the script they were forced to read from.\\n\\nAbove all\\, don't take your kids to this movie.  Both my kids recoiled when Luke squeezed milk from the breast of a giant alien mermaid.  I'm not sure how this got a PG-13 rating.","true":true}
