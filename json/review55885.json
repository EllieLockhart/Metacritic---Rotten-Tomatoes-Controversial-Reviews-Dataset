Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed TLJ. I have seen it 3 times now and it\u2019s gotten better each time. I have no issues with Luke\u2019s attitude after failing Ben Solo. Felt natural\\, actually. I do have a few minor nitpicks but one major gripe but not that I know about it it doesn\u2019t take away from the film. That nitpick is Leia surviving in space. It just comes out of nowhere and no reason why her physical body is able to survive the space environment. But other than that it was really good. Looking forward to how they wrap up the series with IX. I know JJ won\u2019t let us down. ","true":true}
