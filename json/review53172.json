Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically rejects the loose threads set up by TFA.  Got into a heated debate on FB on this\\, with someone seeing it as a refreshing direction\\, while I saw it as lazy story-telling\\, and ruining several arcs\\, not to mention removing\/ruining character development.  Disappointed\\, but perhaps the new direction Star Wars is taking isn't for fans like me anymore.","true":true}
