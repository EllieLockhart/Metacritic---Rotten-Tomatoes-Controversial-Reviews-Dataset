{"101487":121876,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For the most part\\, it was really slow with a stretched plot.\\nThroughout the movie\\, the rebels are slowly fleeing in space with Star destroyers following until they exhaust the rebels fuel. While Holdo takes over for the ship\\, Poe calls her out on her command to board the escape pods and flee because they'd be shot. Though\\, she didn't explain her plan as to how they could get away safely\\, so Poe secretly has Fin go on a mission with Rose to infiltrate the First order ship and deactivate the tracker (Which spawns a forced relationship.) Meanwhile\\, the film also follows Rei with Luke. So it's Rei and Luke\\, Poe on the rebel ship\\, and then Fin and Rose on their mission. And the thing is\\, Fin failed\\, and Holdo's plan was then explained to Poe anyway. So it was all for nothing and it felt like filler. It amounted to nothing... If Holdo wasn't forced by the script to withhold info\\, half the film would be gone. It took a long time for each party to reach their destination. Because of that\\, it felt like little was accomplished and the movie progressed to a snails pace. Another bit about Holdo\\, is that she sacrificed herself to save the rebels yet I didn't feel for her nor did it feel like any kind of redemption. She just kinda stayed aboard and then thought of the idea. The character was nothing more than a plot device.That's not all though\\, it wasn't just slow. SPOILER. Snoke dies without a fight by the hand of Kylo whom now fights for his own vision which sets him apart from the other Sith lords. it would have been nice to see him and Rei battle him together rather than rob us from seeing him fight once.\\nBesides that\\, the score was forgettable and there were no character themes. The score in the original trilogy and prequels amplified the emotion or emphasized the action. The duel of fates is forever burned into memory as it goes hand in hand with the climax of a duel. None of the score felt like star wars to me.\\nAs for the movie being star wars\\, there were times it just didn't feel like star wars. Be it the mood\\, or location. There were hardly any recognizable races\\, such as Rodians\\, Twileks\\, etc. And the films feel overall was just... weird? like\\, Luke squeezing the tit of an alien and drinking the milk. Also\\, the scene with Leia bringing herself back to the ship by the use of her force in space seemed off to me. And lastly\\, Canto Bight being off putting with many strange aliens that catch you off guard. Another couple moments that were odd was the humor that's spread across many modern films. Poe acting like Starlord with his humor giving a bad start\\, to Fin waking up in a leaking suit. The Porgs didn't make it any easier as well...\\nAnother slew of smaller matters would be one\\, a missed opportunity to have Lando at Canto Bight. 2\\, actually have Luke react to the news of Han's death\\, don't cut away and never acknowledge it. 3\\, Admiral Ackbar's death was glossed over. 4\\, no info on Snoke\\, even though he dies. It shouldn't be explained in the expanded universe\\, but the film of which he originated.\\n\\nThe climax: In episode eight\\, the rebels land on the abandon outpost\\, Crait\\, that is where the line of First order ATM6 walkers approach the mining structure where the rebels take refuge. You think this is the big finally\\, but it was ultimately underwhelming and less exciting than the Hoth assault.\\n\\nMoving onto the pro's in the movie\\, I'd say the second half is where things move along. After some time\\, you will come to understand Luke's history with the temple that was destroyed by Ben\\, (Kylo) and it feels satisfying. Among that of which I liked was an unexpected appearance by Yoda to speak to Luke.\\nThe best scene in the movie\\, (or at least most entertaining\\,) was the battle between Rei and Kylo against Snoke's Praetorian guards. It was interesting to see Kylo and Rei join forces and fight by each other's side. That was pretty bad ass\\, though again\\, lacked proper score.\\n\\nOverall\\, the film was good for a first watch to witness the story's development\\, but it's got little longevity to me for multiple viewings.","true":true}
