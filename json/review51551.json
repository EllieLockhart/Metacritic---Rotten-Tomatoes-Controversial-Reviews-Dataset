Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A corporate monstrosity with a corrupt soul.\\nA Jedi never loses his light saber- Luke just tosses it like garbage.\\nA Jedi knows that all is the way force wields it - But Luke is still broken and pathetic. \\nA normal human being would never try to kill a young boy just because he\/she senses that the boy is evil- but Luke does just that. That is plain criminal.\\nThis is a movie hell bent on discrediting the old characters and showing that the new kids on the block are the real deal. It will only appeal to those who don't know squat about why star wars is so much loved. \\nAdd to this the pandering towards political groups and you have an abomination of the original Star Wars.","true":true}
