Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt like The Last Jedi gave us a rougher story to follow and definitely not what the average fan was expecting but in all the I felt it gave what was needed. The story was a tough one to tell but if you pay attention its a strong message to us and to the story. There were scenes i didn\u2019t care for that they could have done differently or even left out but over all I enjoyed the film as a whole and look forward to the next installment.","true":true}
