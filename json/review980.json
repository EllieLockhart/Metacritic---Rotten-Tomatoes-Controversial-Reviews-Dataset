Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An OK Star Wars movie\\, a couple plot twists were nice\\, the rest were too much and obnoxious. Story line is Empire Strikes Back played in reverse or a 2 1\/2 hour car chase where no one turns (whichever you prefer). John Williams made yet another fantastic film score. I didn\u2019t hate Porgs until after I saw the movie and it was confirmed that they were only placed in movie to sell toys. Canto Bight could have been a great addition but it was used for a pathetic side quest. It really was a good movie over all\\, but made a lot of missteps. If it wasn\u2019t a Star Wars film it wouldn\u2019t have gotten 3 1\/2 Stars from me\\, but it does still have a standard to uphold and it held it\\, but not high.","true":true}
