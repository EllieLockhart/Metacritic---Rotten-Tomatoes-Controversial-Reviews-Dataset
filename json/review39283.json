Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has totally derailed Star Wars.  Disney may want to look in to dismissing Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson to save the brand.  Very disappointed.  Will not see it again and recommending no one else see it.","true":true}
