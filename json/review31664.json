Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, Rian Johnson basically did a magic trick for all of us that didn't like the movie.  He took our favorite puppy\\, placed it in a bag\\, and repeatedly hit that bag with a stick.  We're concerned about the well-being of our dog...meanwhile\\, others are commenting what a bold and different approach he took with the trick and accusing us of being too attached to the puppy.\\n\\nThere's plenty wrong with every one of the movies; however\\, the reviewer scores and the audience scores have never been further apart than 14%.  It's great if you loved the film\\, but please understand that this isn't the usual \\\"fanboys being fanboys\\\" crap.\\n\\n\t                                       RS\tAS\t\\nA New Hope\t                        93\t96\t  3\\nThe Empire Strikes Back\t94\t97\t  3\\nReturn of the Jedi\t                80\t94\t14\\nThe Phantom Menace\t        55\t59\t  4\\nAttack of the Clones\t        66\t57\t -9\\nRevenge of the Sith\t        79\t65   -14\\nThe Force Awakens\t        93\t88\t -5\\nRogue One\t                        85\t87\t  2\\nThe Last Jedi\t                        92\t54   -38","true":true}
