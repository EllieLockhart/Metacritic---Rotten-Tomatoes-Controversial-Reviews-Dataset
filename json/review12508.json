Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can see why many didn\u2019t like this film\\, but it\u2019s such an improvement over The Force Awakens. It\u2019s not perfect: there\u2019s an over abundance of silliness which I guess I have to expect from Disney movies now. As TFA was a rip-off of a New Hope this one almost tries to fake us out on every point. One plot line which was mostly a waste of time and the film could have benefited from trimming.","true":true}
