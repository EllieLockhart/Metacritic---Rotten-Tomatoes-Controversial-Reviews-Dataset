Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was almost as bad as the prequels. Terribly contrived plot twists. Comically bad dialogue. And oh the porgs. It had its moments. Snokes scenes were good. Rey and Kylo was good. ","true":true}
