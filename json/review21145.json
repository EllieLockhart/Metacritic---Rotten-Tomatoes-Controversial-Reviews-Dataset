Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was thrilled with numerous scenes and shocked by others. Some scenes stepped outside my Star Wars world view and reminded me of what it was like when we started this journey in 1977. I was entertained and yet had mixed emotions until I realized my kids loved it and I was reminded who these films were intended for in the beginning. ","true":true}
