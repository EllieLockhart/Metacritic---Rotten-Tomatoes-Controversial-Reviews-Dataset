The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I finished the game a few days ago\\, and it has taken me a minute to process everything that happened.  I think that it was a powerful and grounded game.  It delves into consequences of actions\\, and sometimes the smallest decision can have the worst consequence.  This is a world with no laws or rules to hold people accountable.  Justice can be sought out by anyone\\, but justice also varies based on the perspective.  And that is what this game shows.\rI loved getting to see how Abby and Ellie's paths affected each other. I thought it was heartbreaking when I knew Abby was seeing one of her friends for the last time\\, and that really made me think about how willing I was to hit the square button while playing as Ellie.  When I began playing as Abby\\, I didn't like her\\, I didn't like what she did\\, and they make really you take over at a very tense moment.  But the longer I played as her\\, the more I felt bad for her.  Although\\, I still didn't enjoy fighting Ellie as Abby\\, and it was a hard fight too (proud of Ellie for that).\rThe attention to detail in this game was absolutely amazing.  You can really see the time and effort that was put into it.  The gameplay was fun\\, and using stealth and the tools on hand to take out large groups of enemies was a rush. The dodge button and the jump button were so useful as there were countless times I found myself using them even when it wasn't necessary because they were such a great addition to the gameplay.\rWhile I still don't know how I feel about the ending\\, I have to admit\\, this was a beautifully done game with a powerful story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
