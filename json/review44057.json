Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ is a mish-mash of incoherent plot lines\\, coupled with a complete disregard for the previous canon\\, and spiced with cartoon physics. TLJ adds to the canon ridiculous force powers\\, that have never even been hinted at before\\, as ham fisted plot devices.  In addition\\, a hugely overpowering new weapon is revealed that if used in the first trilogy would have negated the entire story arc.  Way to go Disney. \\n\\nLayer that with the complete disregard of space physics with laser cannon shooting ballistic arcs\\, bombs \\\"falling in space\\\"\\, etc.; you literally have script writers obviously better suited to writing for Mickey Mouse cartoons.  Throw in Leia surviving explosive decompression (not counting the new force power reveal) and this movie is a complete unmitigated disaster on about every level imaginable and is an embarrassment to all that were associated with it.","true":true}
