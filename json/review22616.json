Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Life long Star Wars fan.  Saw the Last Jedi last night and left the movie confused and became angry the more I thought about the movie.  Millions of people have been waiting to see Luke as a aged Jedi Master since 1983 and Disney and Rian Johnson basically nutered him and kicked sand in the face of every fan who waited 20+ years for this moment to come.  Moreover\\, I guess Disney decided it would be fun (and profitable?) to literally dispense with every plot thread created in Force Awakens in the glibbest fasion I can remember seeing.  This filim is a disrespectful money grab that expressly wants to kill Star Wars' past so that it can promote the new characters\\, who are so poorly devloped (and acted in my opinion) that I cannot seeing caring about them or the next movie they will headline.  Keep youtr money folks and ingnore the reviews.  I am not much for conspiracy theories\\, but if 93% of critics rate the Last Jedi as fresh\\, 93% of critics must be on Disney's payroll.","true":true}
