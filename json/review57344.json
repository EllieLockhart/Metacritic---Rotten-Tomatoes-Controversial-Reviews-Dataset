Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the culmination of all that has gone wrong in the new Star Wars trilogy. I don't even know where the begin. First and foremost\\, they have completely ruined the original spirit\\, lore\\, and lifeblood of the original films. Even episodes 1-3 kept with the spirit of what Star Wars is all about despite the atrocious acting. The new series\\, underscored by this film\\, has completely disgrace the Star Wars franchise. It starts from the very\\, very beginning of the film when Poe was making  jokes to the New Order officials...this isn't Guardians of the Galaxy\\, wtf are you doing!? It just went straight downfilll from there. The rebel ship dropped bombs\\, which somehow had gravitational force\\, on the New Order fleet\\, what the hell was with Leia doing that whole \\\"Superman in space\\\" thing\\, it made zero sense whatsoever that Luke died because he pulled his force muscle or whatever\\, wtf did they make Yoda look like a puppet again as if they didn't have CGI technology\\, the entire casino planet part was completely unnecessary and totally pointless\\, and\\, lastly\\, the acting of Finn and Rose were so bad it should be the highlight of all the criticism...that bad.","true":true}
