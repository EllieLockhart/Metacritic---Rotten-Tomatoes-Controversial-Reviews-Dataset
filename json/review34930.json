Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is riddled with poor plot\\, poor writing and awful decisions at all levels of the production. Critics can't stand by what they are saying when they praise this film as the majority of fans can see how horribly the director treated their beloved characters.\\n\\nMy half star is for the scenes involving Luke and Rey together\\, everything else didn't work for me.\\n\\nI enjoyed Rogue One and The Force Awakens but this film needs to be retconned fast.","true":true}
