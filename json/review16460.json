Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm still on the fence about The Last Jedi; I appreciate the risks and chances taken to make a new story in a very well-worn (and well-loved universe)\\, but irrelevant plot lines and discontinuities still grate me the wrong way. I'll watch again\\, but in the comfort of my own home.","true":true}
