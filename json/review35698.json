{"101487":175296,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-02-27","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a terrible movie and by far the worse in the franchise\\, actively ruining everything The Force Awakens set up\\, while offering nothing in return. To summarize\\, this movie's sole purpose is to subvert the viewer's expectations as much as possible\\, regardless of how those subversions actually impact the characters\\, story\\, plot or established lore in the universe. \\nThis movie takes everything that was so brilliantly set up in The Force Awakens and throws it out the window. Who is Snoke? Who are Rey's parents and why is she so powerful? Where did they find Luke's lightsaber? Who are the Knights of Ren? All those questions and more are either answered with the most underwhelming\\, and dismissive answers\\, or not even mentioned at all.  This movie actively punishes you for ever getting invested in this new trilogy\\, and because of that it leaves you uninvested in what's to come in Episode 9.\\nThe treatment of characters is abysmal. Luke is completely out of character here\\, becoming a pathetic coward who would rather hide on an island and die than go and help his friends and sister Leia. (Keep in mind\\, this is supposed to be the same man who confronted both Vader and Palpetine together\\, because he saw a shred of good in his father.) Rey is unexplainably given more and more powers and abilities without having to earn or work for a single one of them\\, further playing into her role as a Mary Sue\\, an issue that plagued TFA. Worse yet\\, his movie could have actively fixed that problem\\, however it decides to subvert your expectations by delivering the most underwhelming explanation of her origins imaginable\\, further making her into a bigger and bigger Mary Sue. Poe is made into a hot-headed fool\\, despite his clear leadership abilities in the last movie\\, Hux is reduced to gag humor\\, Snoke is apparently irrelevant and also way out of character based on his portrayal and appearance in TFA\\, Finn is still completely useless\\, Leia is uninspiring\\, and Phasma is treated even worse in this movie than the she was in the last one\\, as if that was even possible. Rose is the new Jar Jar Binks\\, providing nothing but annoyances\\, illogical decision making\\, and no substance to back it up. Holdo\\, perhaps even worse\\, is the most illogical character in the entire franchise and could have prevented 90% of this movie from happening\\, had she just said what the plan was. The only redeemable character in this entire movie is Kylo Ren. That's it.\\nAlong with all that\\, this movie retreads parts of the original trilogy again\\, including the throne room scene from Return of the Jedi\\, the battle of Hoth and the protagonist seeking training from an old Jedi master from Empire Strikes Back\\, all done much more poorly the second time around. \\nAll in all\\, this movie actively destroys this trilogy from the inside out\\, ruining everything good that was set up in TFA\\, while leaving nothing of interest to be desired in Episode 9. It mistreats every single character in the story\\, provides a story filled with plot holes and inconsistencies\\, and shoehorns in awkward comedic moments that kills whatever tension and drama this movie had\\, all in the name of subverting your expectations.
