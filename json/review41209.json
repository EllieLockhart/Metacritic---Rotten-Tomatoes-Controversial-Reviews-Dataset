Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has too many flaws to count\\, the story is terrible(kills what made star wars fascinating and shows old and new characters do absurd things with little to no explanation to why or how)\\, the fights are horribly choreographed (there's a scene where 2 main characters fight 6 red guys\\, 2 of the 6 spin aimlessly around without hitting or being hit\\, no it wanst the force) I cant believe this got through editing.\\n\\nThe movie implies that the audience is stupid and cant think for itself or be critical of the plot. It expects that you sit through it and accept everything without question\\, without reason\\, things get even worse when already established things such as hyperspace travel\\, character moral codes and even previous events from other movies are twisted and often even ignored.\\n\\nMy advice\\, dont go watch this movie\\, youll only be disappointed.","true":true}
