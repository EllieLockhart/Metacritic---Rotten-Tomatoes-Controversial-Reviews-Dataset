Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a horrible disappointment in so many aspects of film making.  I was on the fence of liking TFA only if this movie fleshed out the concepts that TFA brought into the SW universe.  Rian Johnson manages to not only deviate from anything meaningful\\, he basically gives fans a hearty FU by gutting Luke Skywalker's character and writing himself into a corner which I serious doubt can be fixed. \\n\\nAt least the prequels worst characters had meaning to them.  Rose\\, Phasma\\, Finn\\, have no value to these movies.  Could be completely cut out and it wouldn't matter.  The whole \\\"lets make this a girl power movie\\\" could have been completely avoided by putting more ALIENS in the flick.  Lucas had a vision and a feel to his creations.  Clearly it cannot be duplicated.  It may take place in the SW universe but it definitely doesn't feel like a SW movie.","true":true}
