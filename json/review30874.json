Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So bad that Luke commits suicide.\\nPoe and Fin are either bad actors or maybe their lines are garbage. \\nPoe actually ruined this movie for me in the first 10 mins with the oh so hilarious telecommunication jokes. My 9 year old even looked at me with a raised eyebrow to ask are you serious?\\n\\nWhy introduce even more useless characters with nonsense stories when your killing off what a lot of us thought was a cool new villain with no explanation of who he is. Seriously is Snoke a sith or can we not get a line? Just kill it if you have to ya plot and all. \\n\\nThe whole story is weak based on ion engines running out of fuel. That's the last problem ion engines face. Weak story with a boring useless middle story... find the tracker\\, ya ok. \\n\\nHere's a hint. The fans wanted to see Luke kick ass. I'm done. I'm not going to watch their new weak stories with their stupid new characters. Disney sunk this ship faster than the pirates.","true":true}
