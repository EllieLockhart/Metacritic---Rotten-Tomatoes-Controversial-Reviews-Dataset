Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Setting aside a few unnecessary scenes\\, the whole movie really holds up as a sequel to Episode VII\\, and offers a solid\\, self-contained\\, original story that most Star Wars should be able to enjoy.\\nAlthough\\, if you didn't like VII\\, odds are you won't like VIII either.","true":true}
