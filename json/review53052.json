Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside the most famous scenes\\, this movie disrespects the foundations of Star Wars lore\\, that any fan who just scratches the surface\\, would know. What the \\\"hardcore\\\" fans complain about is all true. Rey is overpowered (although Daisy Ridley brings an iconic performance)\\, Finn is still my favourite character in this trilogy (John Boyega\\, hands down\\, deserves an award for the rushing into action scenes)\\, Kylo Ren is a controversial but admirable villain (Adam Driver's acting gave me the chills it was brilliant and other times glued my eyes to the screen to see what's happening next). My heart goes out to Mark Hamill. The actors did all they could. But by dismissing basic elements of the Star Wars universe and downright going against the lore in multiple occasions often made me annoyed and angry while watching. The Force doesn't work like this\\, the galaxy has more alien species\\, where are the characters from canon? I have so many un-answered questions\\, and this movie gave no explanation to any of those.","true":true}
