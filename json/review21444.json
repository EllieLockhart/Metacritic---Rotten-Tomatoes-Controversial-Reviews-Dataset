Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I won't spoil the movie\\, but the movie had some throwback moments and good battle scenes. There were questionable decisions with how some of the characters fate played out. I didn't mind that it ran over 2 hrs long but some scenes\/moments could've been better used to explain back stories. I'd watch it again though.","true":true}
