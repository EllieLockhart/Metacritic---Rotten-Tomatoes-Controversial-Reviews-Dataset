Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Extremely disappointed. Lack of story. No character development. Nonsensical scenes. Movie could be shortened to 30 minutes. No one clapped at the end. Didn't feel like Star Wars. Not planning to see next Star Wars movies.\\n\\nCreated an account to put my first review up\\, so shocked at this movie's level of letdown.","true":true}
