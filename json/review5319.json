Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely reminded me of the old Star Wars magic. I love the fact that we are left with 'real' characters and a lot of pretentious theories were debunked.  It was not perfect but good enough for 5 stars from me!","true":true}
