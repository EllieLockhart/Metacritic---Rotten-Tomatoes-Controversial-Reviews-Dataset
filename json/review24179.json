Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mediocre. I truly thought that that the Star Wars franchise would have a chance with Disney taking over after seeing the Force Awakens and seeing Rogue One but Disney does what Disney does best push out movies as fast as humanly possible to make as much money as fast as humanly possible.","true":true}
