Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saddens me to say it\\, but The Last Jedi ruined the Star Wars Universe for me. The weird pacing\\, the fact that the plot circled around a ship not being able to jump closer to a target\\, the destruction of the buildup for Finn\\, Kylo Ren\\, and Rey\\, and the destruction of 30 years of Luke... really hurt the movie. I don't understand how the Tomatometer gives it a 91%\\, while the Audience score is 51%. The disparity between the two really makes me wonder how legit these ratings are.","true":true}
