Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are numerous problems with this movie. Plot holes and things that simply do not make sense. Multiple interesting questions introduced in the force awakens are simply dropped. At times the humor is almost a mockery of the existing franchise. All in all the movie was still entertaining but within the context of the freanchise it was an imense disapointment.","true":true}
