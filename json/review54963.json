Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was a good movie\\, just not a good star wars saga movie.  It felt more like a standalone star wars movie such as Rogue One.  It handled and connected all story elements from the Force Awakens poorly.  Switching directors is fine\\, but Disney should really needed some people to make sure the story and pacing had cohesion.  I know a lot of effort was put into tweaking Rouge One and even the up coming Solo (Han) movie\\, and it seemed that the Last Jedi just didn't get as much love or care.  While the prequels suffered from some bad acting and direction\\, story wise this is the worst Star Wars movie to date.  There was no respect or care given to the 7 movies that came before this\\, with neither the world or characters they have built.  While I'm still hopeful that Episode 9 could still fix some of the storylines\\, I fear that the Last Jedi have ruined it so much that one single remaining 2 hour movie would not be able to repair.  Thus this movie will have destroyed 9 movies and 30+ years of a beloved galaxy far far away...","true":true}
