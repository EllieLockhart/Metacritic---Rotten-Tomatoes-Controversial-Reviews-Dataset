Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film turned out not how I expected\\, and everything we said would happen was wrong. While there are some extra long scenes a couple things for people to quibble over\\, this Star Wars film is strongly consistent and recalls classic moments while pushing the franchise forward in an egalitarian spirit. Like burning old brush to make room for a new forest\\, the film follows Luke Skywalker's lead - and grants Kylo Ren's wish - in making room for the next generation by getting rid of major figures and institutions. I appreciate the film's balance of drama\\, action\\, comedic moments\\, and philosophical dialogue. This is the most philosophical episode\\, and it also looks beyond the two sides of light and dark fighting. Many have complained about the side mission to the casino planet\\, but the payoff is showing how certain business people profit off the war\\, and beneath their glitzy lifestyle is cruelty","true":true}
