Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars. This is not good Star Wars. The more I think about Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy's reasoning behind what motivates the characters in this installment the more upset I get. For example\\, Rose crashing into Finn cuz he was sacrificing himself for the greater good (love) and then telling him the resistance will only win by doing things out of love left me dumbfounded. During multiple moments while watching the movie I remember wondering if a teenager wrote the script and purposely cut out everything that we were looking forward to just to say\\, \\\"Gotcha\\\". Yes\\, JJ Abrams left a lot of mystery boxes in The Force Awakens for Rian to answer and yes it was a copy of A New Hope but Rian decided to answer barely any of those questions. When he did I was only left with disappointment. If I could give this review half a star I would. Apparently Rotten Tomatoes doesn't accept score under one star so The Last Jedi's score is actually closer to 24%. I honestly wish this movie would be retracted by Disney and Kathleen Kennedy should be fired for pushing political crap in a Star Wars film. I don't even care to see episode IX or the upcoming Solo movie. Disney and Lucasfilms (*cough Kathleen Kennedy cough*) are not giving the true Star Wars fans\\, who care about EU and lore\\, the movie they deserve.","true":true}
