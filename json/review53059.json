Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A slow car chase with a bad side story. They make fun of them self to the point it feels more like Space Balls joke. Its like thy have no understanding of how to use ships could work. Run out of fuel? You have how many ties in all those ships big ol ships\\, but you run them out of gas? You don't make one ship jump ahead\\, and then jump back in front of them. You get to see some cool stuff happen\\, but to get you to those spots its rubbish. Leia had a perfect out\\, but they could not let it happen. Lets not pass up they killed the spirit of Luke character at its core. Darth Snooki is the biggest waste of story buildup I have ever seen. I wish Lucas could save us\\, but he cant. I would have been more happy to see Jar Jar Binks return then how this story turned out. J.J. Abrams & Rian Johnson should feel bad for what they did to this story. Lucas save us...","true":true}
