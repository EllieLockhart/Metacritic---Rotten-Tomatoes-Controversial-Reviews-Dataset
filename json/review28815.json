Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rarely is a movie so bad that it not only ruins itself\\, but it also ruins the entire franchise.  This movie simultaneously undoes The Force Awakens and destroys my interest for the third installment \\\"in one swift stroke.\\\"  RIP Star Wars ... 1977-2017.","true":true}
