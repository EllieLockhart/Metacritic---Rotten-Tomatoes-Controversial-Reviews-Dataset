Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account because I find even more insulting than the abomination that is The Last Jedi is Disney's obvious attempt to influence movie goers with bullshit critic reviews and fake fan reviews gushing over the film. It is yet another attempt to tell the public that the elite knows best and we should follow like sheep. I am pleased to see the 51% audience score\\, but probably should be lower due to the fake fan\/Disney employee positive reviews.  Have you noticed that the positive review lack specific details while the negative reviews overwhelmingly are peppered with specific examples and clearly laid out arguments?  Disney's attempt to blame the negative reviews is bullshit. They are the ones creating this false narrative that the reviews are generated by bots and only fanboys would hate TLJ. This is so insulting to our collective intelligence that I had to create an account to speak out. TLJ was the initial insult and now this propaganda from Disney. I will not support any future Star Wars endeavors as long as Disney's attached.","true":true}
