Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aweful... leave it to Disney to cheapen every scene and ruin Star Wars... I walked away feeling as if the entire movie had no real meaning other than to regurgitate scenes from the original and pretty much destroy everything the star wars saga stood for..Luke was pretty much the only silver lver lining in this movie but then they killed that too..","true":true}
