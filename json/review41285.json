{"101487":184242,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a disappointment to the hardcore fans of the Star Wars universe and it shows Disney's lack of respect to the people that actually made Star Wars great. For the rest of the audience there are Porgs\\, new AT-AT walkers\\, some new ship designs\\, some new plastic red guardians and all the cheesy jokes to enjoy. It's poorly written with fake drama\\, irrelevant moments and fails to answer the questions that were raised in the Force Awakens. So for all the people who actually care about storyline\\, character development and cohesion - sorry guys\\, go watch Thor: Ragnarok. I won't even start with the whole diversity\\, social justice warrior stuff that the movie is filled with. Characters like Phasma\\, Snoke\\, The Knights of Ren are just basically thrown out of the storyline. Answers related to Rey's parents\\, Luke's motivation\\, the role of the New Republic\\, the creation of the First Order are nonexistent. Instead we got some romance between Finn and Rose\\, some alien horses\\, some guys who like playing at the space casino\\, a lady with purple hair\\, some plastic dudes who turned to be quite useless in their one job (defending \\\"Supreme Leader Snoke\\\"). The whole leadership of the First Order is mocked and ridiculed from the start. How do you tell a serious story when one of the main antagonists is thrown around on spaceships and AT-AT ? We saw some robots ironing uniforms and a BB-9E unit which is more smart than the entire crew of the ship (no matter how big it was). We saw \\\"dreadnoughts\\\" being destroyed by a fighter and a bomber\\, we saw Snoke's ship being split in half\\, Leia is now immune to space vacuum and temperature\\, Yoda can cast lightnings\\, Snoke can foresee the future but not his own death. We had to listen preachings about loyalty\\, weapons deals and politics (although the new Republic is nowhere to be found). Luke dies after a heart attack. Kylo is now ambitious to do what exactly ? Conquer the galaxy with his useless army and navy ? Find and kill Rey ? Destroy the resistance which is now down to no more than 10 people ? The whole movie is nothing more than a toy advertisement.","true":true}
