Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie pisses in the faces of fans everywhere. The only way to save the sequel trilogy at this point is for Rey to lose HARD in the finale. If she escapes episode IX with more than two limbs I'm done with star wars.","true":true}
