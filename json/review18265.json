Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought The Last Jedi was actually a great movie. The events of the movie make complete sense when following the story line of all the movies. In my opinion it fits in perfectly. It was fun to watch with plenty of action and had a few comical scenes also. There are sad parts that people won\u2019t like but that\u2019s part of good story telling. ","true":true}
