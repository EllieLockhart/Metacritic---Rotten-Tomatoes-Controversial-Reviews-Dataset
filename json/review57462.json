Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was really terrible. The critics were paid to lie to us. It was like watching a mashup of the Matrix\\, Fast\/Furious\\, Casino\\, and Avengers with a Star Wars skin. Luke was a let down. Snoke was a let down. Rey is ridiculous\\, she can just do anything with no training at all. It suffers from all the problems of TFA and then adds a bunch of it's own.\\n\\nPoe is the only decent character\\, the rest were thrown in to make some board of diversity happy. All the bad guys are white guys\\, all the leaders of the rebellion are women. Everyone seems to know everything\\, including conversations they weren't a part of. Rey knows the content of conversations between Luke and other characters from Empire and New Hope. It is stupid stupid stupid.\\n\\nHalf the audience had walked out by the time I left with 20 minutes to go.\\n\\nSteaming pile of BANTHA POO!!!!!!!","true":true}
