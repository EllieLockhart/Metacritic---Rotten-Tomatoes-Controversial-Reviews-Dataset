{"101487":178764,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-12-20","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were many problems in the last jedi e.g. deaths of people we really don't care about\\, the snoke throne scene is a direct copy from a classic: Return Of The Jedi\\, and luke sending a force projection of himself halfway across the galaxy to confuse kylo (like what??) etc. But I think it's safe to say that the critics on this movie\\, are full of sh*t.","true":true}
