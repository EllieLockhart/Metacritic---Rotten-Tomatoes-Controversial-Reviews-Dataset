Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful film with great acting\\, the side stories and terrible lines make me wonder if they re-read the acript at all. This film takes any interesting questions from the Force Awakens and says... Who cares. Nothing has really happened here to move the trilogy along. The audience is just as puzzled as to what is happening in the universe. While it does a good job of using red herrings and anti-tropes\\, the lack of gravity for a pivotal film makes it hard to Totally get behind. The fight scens are fantastic though. Again\\, it is a very well built film in terms of the acting and visual\/adoo teams... The writing just let down those valient effors.","true":true}
