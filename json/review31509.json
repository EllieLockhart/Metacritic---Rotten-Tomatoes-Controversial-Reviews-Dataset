Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some ups but to much lows. The Last Jedi is a movie that must be a feast for the fans of the charismatic space opera but for the occasional movie goer is just plain mess. The plot is very thin and full of holes... Maybe because there is three sub plots in it and the movie just goes on and on without a clear path. I cut at least 30mns from it to make it more focused. Some characters are very nice specially that Kylo one. The guy is a good actor indeed... All the rest are just plain simple (the one dimensional bad guy).. and sometimes boring (aka Finn sub plot). I loved the visuals!! Incredible without a doubt.","true":true}
