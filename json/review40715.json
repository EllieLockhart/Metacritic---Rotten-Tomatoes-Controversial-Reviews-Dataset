Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This lousy movie has been bothering me since I saw it a few weeks ago.  I loved star wars as a kid but this mindless garbage has destroyed it for me.  It was just insulting.  I'd never heard of Rian Johnson before seeing this movie but I will never anything that moron makes.","true":true}
