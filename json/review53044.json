Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a twenty-year-old who has been enamored with Star Wars since childhood\\, I am always excited to see a new Star Wars film. The amount of love I have for the franchise and it's many stories from books\\, TV shows\\, comics\\, video games\\, and of course all eight (now nine)\\, movies is unparalleled. I went into The Last Jedi with few expectations\\, and the film completely blew me away. After the first time seeing it\\, it definitely resonated with me\\, and now having seen it four times\\, I fall more in love with it. The story is completely unexpected but is so perfect. Kylo Ren is absolutely one of the best things in The Last Jedi and one of the best characters in the franchise. Shout out to Adam Driver!!!! Daisy Ridley as Rey- Amazing. I can't wait to see where her story goes. And as for my OG Heroes\\, Luke and Leia\\, Carrie and Mark do an amazing job. Thank you\\, Rian Johnson\\, for this amazing addition to the Star Wars universe. I absolutely loved The Last Jedi and if it's even possible I love Star Wars even more than before.","true":true}
