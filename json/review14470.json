Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated it. Hated it. And I'm not a bot. I'm a real person. The movie was corny and a lie to the Star Wars Universe. The only good thing is Luke Skywalker's confrontation with Kylo Ren\\, which is why it gets 1 1\/2 stars. Don't bother convincing me otherwise.","true":true}
