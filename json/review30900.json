Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Social justice warriors have ruined this franchise. I\u00e2(TM)m all for diversity and if anyone wants to create a space opera of mostly women kicking ass\\, fine. But this movie force fed us Kathleen Kennedy\u00e2(TM)s idea of diversity and female empowerbent. It\u00e2(TM)s so obvious and crowbarred into the movie. I don\u00e2(TM)t buy it for a minute. This move wasn\u00e2(TM)t just bad\\, it was retroactively bad. This made all the proceeding moveis worse. \\n\\nThis franchise is not only dead\\, I wish it never existed.","true":true}
