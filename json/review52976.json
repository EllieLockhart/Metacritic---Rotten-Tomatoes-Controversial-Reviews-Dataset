Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No questions were answered from episode 7. So many plot holes that i felt like i was watching the movie \u201cHoles\u201d. Kylo keeps the audience in suspense by reassuring Rey that he knows who her parents are\\, only to reveal that they were junkyard hobos that sold her for money. Horrible movie. Luke does absolutely nothing\\, its a disgrace. Worst Star Wars film of all time.","true":true}
