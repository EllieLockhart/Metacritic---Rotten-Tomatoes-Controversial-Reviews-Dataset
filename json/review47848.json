Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":".... where to start. How about kylo and rey. The only thing done right in this movie. Special effects were even better in movies that are like a decade old\\, looking at the terrible prequels. This wasnt as bad as attack of the clones or revenge of the sith... might even say its better than phantom menace but this was the worst movie I have seen in years.","true":true}
