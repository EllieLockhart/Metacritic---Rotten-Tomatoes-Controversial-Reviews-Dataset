{"101487":160711,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-02-12","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One star for the visuals and CGI\\, which were really quite excellent. In terms of plot\\, however\\, this film is a mess.\\n\\nWhere to begin? The characterization in this film is all over the place. Poe's character feels very regressed; I can't really imagine that a hotheaded fly-boy would have made it as far in the Resistance military as he did\\, so for him to be portrayed as such is a bit nonsensical. Finn felt pretty in-character\\, although some of the slapstick elements are strange and his entire subplot does little to progress the overall storyline. Rey\\, the presumed heroine of these new movies\\, has very little personal development. She learns that her parents are nobodies\\, which is an Empire-level plot twist that I wish worked\\, but it doesn't. Personally\\, I would have rather had the big \\\"Luke's daughter\\\" reveal. It would have felt more satisfying with the build-up (Anakin's lightsaber \\\"calling\\\" to her\\, Obi-Wan serving as a guiding voice for her\\, etc.) from TFA.\\n\\nOf course\\, Luke's characterization is the most suspect. I'm fine with him being jaded and bitter\\, but it's not done in a way that makes sense. I can't believe Anakin \\\"There's Still Light in Him\\\" Skywalker would draw his lightsaber on a defenseless boy\\, unless Kylo Ren is literally THAT evil--but then\\, what was the point of trying to show Kylo as a sympathetic character throughout TLJ just to say \\\"sike!\\\" at the end? Luke felt like he was written specifically to develop Kylo's backstory and not in any way that makes sense with past portrayals of his character. The only satisfying part of Luke's plotline is\\, depressingly enough\\, his death scene\\, which I felt was both beautiful and fitting.\\n\\nThen there's Rose\\, who is cute and lovely but does not particularly feel like a useful addition to the story. The same can be said for Holdo\\, who I think is meant to be portrayed as a strong feminist character\\, but instead comes off as manipulative\\, condescending\\, and an incompetent commander. I'm all for strong female characters\\, but she was not handled correctly at all. Even some minor appearances felt mishandled--like\\, why was Yoda the one who appeared to (supposedly) destroy the ancient Jedi texts? He was a decidedly \\\"old school\\\" Jedi. It would have made more sense for Anakin to come back\\, light 'em up\\, and maybe casually remind his son not to write off Kylo Ren the same way so many people wrote off Vader. But I digress.\\n\\nOverall\\, I would have welcomed a more subversive entry into the Star Wars franchise\\, but TLJ simply isn't it. It felt like it was trying too hard to be edgy and different at the expense of its own characters and writing. (I still don't understand what the point of Snoke was. In TFA\\, he was kind of creepy\\, mystical\\, and Sidious-esque\\, but in TLJ he looks like Jeff Goldblum in Thor Ragnorak\\, and he dies with very little fanfare. Who is this guy? If Anakin destroyed the last of the sith in ROTJ\\, then where the heck did he come from? It felt like the director didn't know how to develop him\\, except to--big surprise--use him as yet another element in Kylo's arc.)\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see where the next movie goes from here.","true":true}
