Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to like this film. It was not all horror and doom. It is mildly entertaining in a non-fan kind of way. I like the efforts at diversity. But this movie does so much to damage the direction of the previous movies and the star wars universe and history\\, that it is almost a slap in the face. Indeed\\, I believe the writers symbolically burned the sacred Jedi books in our face before saying F-U to Lucas.\\n\\nHow? Just a few :\\n\\n1) Portraying mild mannered Luke as a murderer\\n2) Spitting on the Jedi order and destroying it's very history (possibly an anti-religious message is encoded here)\\n3) Destroying the idea that Jedi need training from a master\\n4) Basically calling the Jedi's accumulated knowledge rubbish\\n5) Removing the idea that the Skywalker bloodline is special in any way\\n6) Removing the idea that the force is tied to bloodline at all\\n7) Killing all the masters (both Sith and Jedi) to replace them with novice children\\n\\nThe audacity of the violence is too much for one movie and this is an obvious attempt to completely  rid Starwars of Lucas' vision and market it to little kids for Halloween and toy sales. (If anyone can be a jedi\\, maybe I am too)\\n\\nThen let's access this \\\"diversity\\\". For all its \\\"diversity\\\" I find it ironic that all the leaders in the movie are essentially quite WASPy or European. All the board leadership\\, the army leadership\\, the sith leadership\\, the jedi leadership... Everyone is white. In fact\\, the ethnic characters are made to bow to chromed omega who we find out is blonde-haired\\, blue-eyed. The love interest that had been growing between Finn and Rey is completely obliterated and replaced by either a love \/ friendship relationship with Kylo. So even in a land far\\, far away we are left with a glass\/bamboo ceiling in which whites occupy leadership roles. Feminism is used as a diversion tactic to be diverse while excluding the non-white.\\n\\nSo\\, ultimately\\, Star Wars diversity is a fake diversity\\, back by a racist Hollywood system\\, 2017 style.\\n\\nRian made a mockery of a movie. May the Sith ghosts haunt him for eternity.","true":true}
