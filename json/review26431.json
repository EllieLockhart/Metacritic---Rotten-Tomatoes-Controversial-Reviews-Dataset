Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"not your typical Star Wars movie. oh sure\\, it's got light sabre fights\\, lineage of the skywalker family taking center stage\\, stormtroopers\\, some kind of cute animals\\, the Force.....ok\\, maybe it is like the others. The effects are great\\, good comedy moments\\, good story (finally no death star)\\, and my favorite part was the \\\"connection\\\" between Rey and Kylo Ren. If you get a chance to see it in the theaters\\, definitely do.","true":true}
