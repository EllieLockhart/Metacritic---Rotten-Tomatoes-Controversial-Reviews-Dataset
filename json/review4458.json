Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Changed up the formula\\, took risks that paid off\\, had some of the most gripping and emotional scenes in the entire saga\\, brilliant visuals\\, twists I didn't see coming\\, and a lot more. Yes it had some flaws. Some of the comic relief felt forced and out of place. I felt it could have been less action packed and had more breathing room. By no means is this the worst Star Wars film in the saga. I would watch this movie 5 times in a row before I submit myself to the self-torture that is Episode 2.","true":true}
