{"101487":189054,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ packs quite a punch\\, but fails to deliver. The resistance escaping the FO armada was the most exceptional part of the movie. And all things considered\\, shows that Poe pretty much carried the movie. His scenes were fun and they were funny. Oscar Isaac does great with the material they give him. It's much better than TFA\\, so I rate the film highly. If TLJ was only about Rey\\, Luke\\, Kylo\\, Finn and Rose; it would have bombed as badly as the prequels.\\n\\nFinn is not leading man material. Lackluster scenes with Rose were a drag. He acts like an idiot through most of the movie. Whether its the contrived Canto Bight plot\\, escape pod shenanigans\\, or his failed attempt to ram the thing at the end.. no matter how you hash it\\, TLJ was not a step up for the former stormtrooper\/toilet plunger. His big fight with Phasma was badass though. Rose is a good addition\\, but you can't hide that she's not an engaging character. She's a supporting player who seems like she stole air-time. No one tuned in\\, nor would tune in to see DJ or Rose\\, ok.\\n\\nRey's scenes with Luke sucked. What was that... one of Luke's first acts after 34 years was milking a freakin space walrus. Luke's lesson to Rey looked like a freakin nature hike. Follow that up with a dark pit\\, looks like woman's v*****  disgusting.... should've ended up on the cutting room floor.  Rey's parents scene... also cutting room floor. But on the positive\\, Rey's scenes with Kylo were much more entertaining. They were a little weird\\, but the climax with killing Snoke\\, was welcome because Snoke sucks. Kylo provides a different kind of anal brat\\, conflicted but pissy.\\n\\nThe conclusion to TLJ was a little confusing\\, but at least they killed Luke. Admittedly was enjoying it till he showed up. The last scene with Kylo was just weird. He did what he does best\\, swing his saber around in a violent tantrum. Guess it's kinda funny. But the meeting of Poe and Rey\\, (since they failed to meet when in the same room at the end of TFA)\\, wets the appetite for actual relationships between Poe\\, Finn\\, Rey\\, and Rose in Episode 9. TLJ has got flaws\\, but characters are now better-established and interesting. If they focus on Finn\\, Rose\\, and Rey in Episode 9; hard to see how it doesn't bomb. One's too emotional\\, one's a sweaty coward\\, and one's a film extra.","true":true}
