Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So utterly disappointing. Looks nice\\, sounds nice and some interesting ideas\\, more so visually. The story and dialogue were shocking. Fails to capitalise on anything set up for it in the previous films and disrespectfully handles every character. \\n\\nThey tried to introduce new characters and planets but they were completely unnecessary\\, dragged the film out and detracted from story arcs that actually mattered. Seen it twice and that's enough. \\n\\nNot looking forward to Ep. IX at all and Johnsons new trilogy\\, if it still gets the green light after this diabolical haemorrhoid of a film\\, then that'll get a miss too!!\\n\\nSo gutted right now.","true":true}
