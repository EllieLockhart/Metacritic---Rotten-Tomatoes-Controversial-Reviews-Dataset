Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was unfortunately bad. I tried my best to like it because I love Star Wars. This is not your typical Star Wars story\\, which would have been fine had there actually been a story. Rather the movie is full of cliche's\\, ex-machina's\\, and failed call backs. There were quite a few surprises and twist that I had not expected\\, but they were hard to enjoy because of all the jumping back and forth to unimportant storylines and cuts. I really enjoyed the Kylo Ren\/Rey conflict\\, and wish more emphasis had been placed on developing them and their conflicts within and with each other. Unfortunately too much time was given to the other 4 non-plot driving side characters. overall as a movie it's fine\\, similar to a marvel movie\\, as Star Wars\\, extremely disappointing.
