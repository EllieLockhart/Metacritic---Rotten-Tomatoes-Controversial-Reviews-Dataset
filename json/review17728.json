Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It crushes my soul to rate Star Wars low but really way too much to overlook or forgive just to get myself to say it is good ... it is ok at best ... yes I had fun but it comes across as a comedy and not a fun sci fi action adventure ... everyone has the right to their opinion but I just felt weird watching this and I usually feel awesome watching Star Wars ... I will see it one more time to be fair to it","true":true}
