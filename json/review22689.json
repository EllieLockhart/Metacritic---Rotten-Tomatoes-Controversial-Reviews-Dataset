Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like no character development. Rey was Kylo's play thing. Finn gets stuck with Rose. One the most boring characters because there is nothing to respect about her character. Poe leads thousands of his comrades to their death\\, because Leia takes a back seat to leading. And Luke was pretty good\\, but we all know it's a waste because he is the older generation paving the way for the new. Meh action. It was like a kid playing with toys. No real reason and no real death. Constantly battered with all hope is lost\\, oh there is the one person who will save us! Disappointed by this movie.","true":true}
