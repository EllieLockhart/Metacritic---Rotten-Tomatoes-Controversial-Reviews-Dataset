It aint for everybody thats for sure. But for me\\, its just down my alley. This is a game YOU need to experience. To give your own judgement. Not **** on it based on some leaks. At the end of the day its the most pre-ordered and best selling PS4 exclusive of all time with more than 4 million copies sold in the first 3 days of release. I think that says a lot. If you dont wanna buy it\\, at least borrow it from a friend. Its worth a try. Oh and also\\, if you want to see real ratings go on the PS Store. Where you can only rate a game ONLY IF YOU BOUGHT IT!! Dont miss out on it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
