Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie 3 times in theaters. When I came out of it the first time\\, I wasnt sure I liked it. I had mixed feelings about how things happened. Over the next few days I thought more and more about it. The more I thought\\, the more upset I became. I went and saw the movie a second time that next weekend and left feeling better about the movie\\, but only because I had come to accept what it was. I hold Episode V as one of my all time favorite movies and I have to say that if things continue this way with the current star wars universe that I will have lost any good will I hold towards this once epic franchise.","true":true}
