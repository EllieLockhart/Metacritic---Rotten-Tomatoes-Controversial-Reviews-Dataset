Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do not watch the story line doesn't follow the cannon. This was not only not enjoyable for fans but just boring for a new watcher. So many flaws to point out in this movie not enough space to put it.","true":true}
