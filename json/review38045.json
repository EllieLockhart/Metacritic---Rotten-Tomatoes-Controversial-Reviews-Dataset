Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story dropped any complexity created from the first movie. With a story that has no real consequences.  Best space combat scenes are all in the trailer. The big death scene that had the most impact required full sound vacuum to provide a dramatic affect as it was the only logical choice and the character that pulled it off had no chance to get anyone to care about them. The best part of the movie that had the most tension was the opening scene and the most heroic moment. However\\, they really should have started the movie where it ended. Sadly\\, now I have no desire to see where this story is going (because it's not going anywhere). I'll wait to see the next one on FX or something. No need to worry about waiting and finding out major spoilers from friends who have more free time than me.","true":true}
