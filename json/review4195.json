Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far one of the greatest in the entire saga.  I didn't know what was going to happen from scene to scene and that is what made it so great!  The only bittersweet part of the whole experience is I'll only get to see it for the first time once.  \\n\\nI won't go so far as to call it my favorite one (yet)\\, but after a couple more viewings I can honestly foresee this becoming my number 1 Star Wars film\\, honestly.","true":true}
