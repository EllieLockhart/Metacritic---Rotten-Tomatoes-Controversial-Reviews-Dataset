Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Turning into an awful Marvel-esque series very quickly. A sad degeneration from the greatness of Episode VII. Hopefully the writers and directors get the hint that this movie was a disgrace to the series and fix it before the next episode. They didn't even have the decency to let go of Carrie Fisher's character when given the opportunity early in the plot. An awful movie by itself but even worse when considering its place in the series as a whole.","true":true}
