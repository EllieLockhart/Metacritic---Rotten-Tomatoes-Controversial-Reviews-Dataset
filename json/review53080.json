Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A steaming pile of lazy insulting tripe that has killed Star Wars for good for so many people. Anyone saying that negative reviews are because of 'bots' should explain why Solo was a massive flop. Nobody went to see Solo because of this abomination. People voted with their feet. Or maybe the bots were responsible for that too? And maybe the bots will also be resposible for Rian Johnson now having his trilogy quietly taken away from him\\, which Disney has done. \\nThe Last Jedi is a bad film in it's own right\\, but as a Star Wars film it's a total disgrace.","true":true}
