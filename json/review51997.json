Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After all the negative audience ratings\\, I reluctantly went to see the film. I had such low expectations. But in the end\\, I loved it. I loved the humour\\, which reminded me of all the funny characters from Tatooine\\, and the pacing and direction was awesome. Action sequences were top notch\\, and I believe they did justice to Luke\\, Leia and other classic Star Wars characters. Thank you Rian for a real Star Wars treat. Way better than the Force Awakens. Han Solo has nothing on Luke.","true":true}
