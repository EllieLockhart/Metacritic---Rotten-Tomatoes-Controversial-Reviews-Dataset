Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you were expecting answers\\, consistently\\, or closure for departing characters it's not in this movie.  Special effects and comedy don't cover up the glaring plots holes and characters inconsistencies.  This train wreck of a movie makes it hard to see or care for movie 9.  If you like Star Wars avoid this one.  If you just like science fantasy it might be be an okay film for the flashy special effects","true":true}
