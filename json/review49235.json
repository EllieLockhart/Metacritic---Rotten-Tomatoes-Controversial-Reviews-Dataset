Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. Rian disrespected the fans and Luke while also creating new ways to use the force that made zero sense. JJ set up everything in the force awakens and Rian Johnson took everything and threw it out the window. Because of this movie\\, I don't care about the rest of the trilogy and like none of the characters remaining.","true":true}
