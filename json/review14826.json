Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have watched all the Star War Movvies. \\n\\nLoved the original\\, hated the pre-quells.  I was so angry with Kylo Ren and wanted him dead for killing Han.  However\\, The Last jedi really made me feel for him and his need for belonging.  I think something tragic happened to the Solo family that tore the apart.  It's human and not s fairy tale.  We all hoped for a Solo happy ending\\, undying love.  But that's not real life.  Ben is the perfect villain and it has been set up full circle.\\n\\nAnakin turned because of Padme.  Ben can turn for Rey.  I hope that's what happens.  I hope we find the tragedy. \\n\\nI love love that Rey isn't tied to someone famous.  It sets her up for the need of belonging.  She and Ben need each other and can bring balance back. \\n\\n\\nI was frustrated at first that Snoke wasn't explained\\, but he really isn't the focus.  Like darth Vader was.  His story isn't important\\, buBens is. Rey's story is.  The Fin and Rose story fell short\\, but it could be bigger in 9.  \\n\\nSome of the jokes were corny\\, bu so were they in the originals. Give it a chance and give 10 a chance. \\n\\nI see something great happening!  Full circle and a different ending for Ben than Anakin. \\n\\nBeautiful Movie!  A little corny\\, but fun! I have watched it twice and will be back a third timebb","true":true}
