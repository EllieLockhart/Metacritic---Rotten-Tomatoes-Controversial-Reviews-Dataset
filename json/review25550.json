Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No story and character development what so ever. \\nMeaningless killing off historic great characters en potentionally great characters.\\nIntroduction of meaningless new characters and destroying their potential.\\nOverly political and therefore much less timeless and more divisive then what Star Wars is supposed to be.","true":true}
