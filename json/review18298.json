Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the prequels were as bad as Star Wars could get. Boy way I wrong.\\nThis movie had about 30 minutes of good story\\, the rest is force fed garbage. There is so much wrong with it I don't even know where to start\\, so I won't. Just google some reviews.","true":true}
