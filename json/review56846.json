Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are three reason why anyone would leave anything above a one star review for The Last Jedi and here they are as follows. Either the individual has no idea what makes a good film\\, the individual has been paid off by someone to state that this movie is anything other than complete garbage\\, or finally\\, the individual is not an individual at all\\, but rather a bot programmed to post five star reviews to help push Disney's destruction of the Star Wars legacy. The problem is not just in the fact that The Last Jedi completely destroys what made Star Wars so great\\, but also in the fact that it is just a bad film\\, objectively. I mean\\, it is so bad that it makes the prequels seem good. I know this is being said a lot as of late\\, but that is literally what I was thinking as I watched this abomination unfold. Boring story and storytelling\\, old characters being killed off without any real closure (Luke Skywalker)\\, while others are all but completely omitted from the film (R2-D2\\, C-3PO). New characters added for no other reason than to push new Disney product (i.e. story books being sold at your local  Wal-Mart). Feminism and political correctness being thrown in your face and don't even speak to me about the Leia in space scene. I mean it truly felt like I was watching a parody of Star Wars. It was that bad. There is so much more to cover\\, but if what I'm telling you isn't enough\\, then I firmly believe that there is nothing that will stop you from seeing what will undoubtedly bring the Star Wars legacy to an absolute halt. I can firmly attest that I will never watch another Star Wars film for the rest of my life. Thanks Disney!","true":true}
