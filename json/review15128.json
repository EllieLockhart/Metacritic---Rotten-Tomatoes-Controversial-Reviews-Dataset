Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it a lot! It was not predictable! I Liked Rey's character the most\\, she really sold me during the fight scene. It's funny how the Fan-Boys are mostly complaining. I saw an interview with George Lucas and he said that when he was making the prequels he became aware that he couldn't make the movies he wanted to make. Looks like Disney went ahead and made the movie they wanted to make and now they have to listen to the whiny little bitches.","true":true}
