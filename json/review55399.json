Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Luke used to be a good friend\\, but that before the dark times when RIan Johnson betrayed and murdered the fans. Not just the fans but he also butchered the lore he was not a good friend.\\n\\nBiggest problems\\n\\n1: The suicide bomber \/ 9\/11 2.0 scene which while it looked cool made no sense at all due to this never happening before and raising the question why didn't the rebels just smash ships into star destroyers and the death stars.\\n\\n2: Luke Skywalkers character assassination for some reason he goes from  not being able to kill Darth Vader because he had some good in him to trying to murder his nephew due to seeing a little darkness in him.\\n\\n3: Finn and Rose plot line was wasted\\, while the acting was fine the script was horrible and made them irrelevant to the overall story.\\n\\n4: The quips and jokes that while they work in the Marvel movies were awkward to watch and not really funny and seemed out of place in a star wars movie.","true":true}
