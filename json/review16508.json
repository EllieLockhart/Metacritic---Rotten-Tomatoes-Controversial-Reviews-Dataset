Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must say this\\, and I understand I might be alone. But most everyone I have talked to among both friends and co workers that this movie failed on many levels. As for myself it really felt like a giant middle finger for 2.5 hours from both the Director and Kathleen Kennedy to everyone that loved 4-5-6 and sorta likes 1-2-3. This is a feeling that is from to many numerous things to go all into. I will say only this\\, I agree with Mark on his take about Luke. I mean from his first seen in the movie with the Light Saber that has in the story as a whole meant so much and just tosses it away like none of that stuff matters at all. To the line that seems like a lecture to the audience if you thought I was just gonna come in and wave my laser sword and make it all better then insert middle finger. That for me sums up what they think of us and our feelings for something that really to me was special. Well that's all I have\\, feel free to go all out and explain to me how I just have it all wrong and just don't get it.","true":true}
