Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Except for the visuals\\, the movie failed in its own right\\, and also damaged core ideas of Star Wars. New ideas properly executed are good. New ideas executed as poorly as in this movie result in questions about leadership.  With so many capable and creative people out there\\, why wasn't there a process for fixing the story? Fixing the dialogue? Fixing the editing? I assume that the ;lack luster score resulting from the poor script and editing.","true":true}
