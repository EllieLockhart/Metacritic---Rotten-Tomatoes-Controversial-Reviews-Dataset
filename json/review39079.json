Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this an ok  movie not a great one\\n\\nthe bad:\\ntoo long \\nsome scene go nowhere \\nthere too many endings scenes or heroic scenes\\n\\nit ask to suspend believe in scene that should not  be in the movie in the first place and are way over the top\\n\\n\\nsome characters are just bad like Rose or the master coder\\n\\nthe actually ending makes no sense and is one of  the worst starwars ending\\n\\nhated the pogs \\n\\n\\nthe good:\\nRay she amazing\\nLuke is good some scene he little over the top but good \\n\\nkilo he very good\\nsome of the other scenes were amazing\\n\\n\\noverall  the good out weight the bad I just wish there wasnot  that many bad for starwars film","true":true}
