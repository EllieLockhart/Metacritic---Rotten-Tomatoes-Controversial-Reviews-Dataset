Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was visually great\\, but the direction went from linear and mysterious to being driven off a cliff and all questions answered with line drive singles instead of homeruns. \\n\\nAdam driver carried this film on his back\\, he's the real mvp\\, he deserves a noble peace prize for his performance instead of an academy award.","true":true}
