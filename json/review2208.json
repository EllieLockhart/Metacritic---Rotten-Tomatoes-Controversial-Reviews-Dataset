Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At first i thought a long star wars movie was exactly what i wanted\\, then the movie started and it felt like something out of guardians of the galaxy and many of the things we thought we knew apparently we didnt so turn your brain off for this movie and you might enjoy it.","true":true}
