Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly disappointing movie! I love Star Wars\\, but Rian Johnson completely ruined Luke Skywalker by making him a sulking wimp! Apparently the laws of physics do not apply to Jedi\\, making them more akin to Marvel superheroes. Snoke is now a throwaway character. Star Wars Episode IX is essentially a stand alone movie now. Clearly\\, Disney had no clear idea for how to handle a new Star Wars trilogy\\, instead deciding releasing a movie and calling it Star Wars is enough to take people's money.","true":true}
