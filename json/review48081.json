Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While The Force Awakens had better pacing and a tighter story\\, The Last Jedi takes a new approach with its characters and introduces new elements to previously established lore in the Star Wars universe. While the movie certainly has its flaws-- Canto Bight dragged on and on\\, Finn\/Rose subplot\\, Leia and the Force\\, and etc.\\, Rian Johnson delivers when it comes to his characterization of Rey\\, Kylo Ren\\, and Luke Skywalker and how they connect. \\n\\nAdam Driver and Daisy Ridley were fantastic in their roles and I was deeply fascinated and enthralled by their Force bond. While Kylo Ren is indeed the \\\"main villain\\\" of this trilogy\\, one can't help but sympathize with this conflicted young man. Like Rey\\, we are hopeful but unsure if he can be redeemed in Episode IX.\\n\\nJohnson does answer some questions in VIII while also leaving some unanswered. For example: Where are the Knights of Ren? Are Rey's parents truly who Kylo claims they are? What will happen to Leia now? What about Luke?","true":true}
