Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An Insane\\, Awesome and Amazing addition to the Star Wars series that not only shows off many new ideas and storylines but also making them enjoyable and fulfilling for the audience.","true":true}
