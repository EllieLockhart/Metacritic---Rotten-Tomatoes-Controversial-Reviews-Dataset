Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Largely awesome\\, left the cinema buzzing wanting to see it again. Not perfect - the whole Finn\/Rose\/DJ subplot could have been done much better and some of the dialogue was a little hammy but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it in particular the throne room scene! Fresh\\, funny\\, takes risks and a great addition to the canon.","true":true}
