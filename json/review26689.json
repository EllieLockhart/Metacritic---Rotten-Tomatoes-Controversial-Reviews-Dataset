Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok movie making but horrible HORRIBLE series destroying movie\\n\\n--SPOILERS--\\n\\nThe Holdo Maneuver: If this is possible\\, and previous Star Wars Movies show it's not\\, but if it is possible then you'd expect every space battle to use it. There'd be ships that are nothing but a hunk of metal and a hyperdrive who's sole purpose is to hyperdrive ram other ships\\n\\nJedi Attacking from the Dead: Apparently all the dead Jedi can use the force from beyond the grave. So they the F haven't they been fighting with the rebellion the entire series?\\n\\nRose saving Finn was the most selfish move ever yet somehow we're supposed to feel good about it.\\n\\nRose and Finn's adventure ended up causing hundreds of deaths\\, no one cares\\n\\nPoe's mutiny basically ignored. Unbelievable\\n\\nThere's more nits but those 4 are enough and the top 2 are effectively the end of Star Wars. We'd now expect every battle to have hyperspace rammers and every battle to be full of dead Jedi calling down lighting bolts from heaven.  Ugh!","true":true}
