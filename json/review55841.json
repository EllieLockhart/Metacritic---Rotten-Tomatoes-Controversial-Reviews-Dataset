Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the best looking star wars to date but the poor writing and continuity within the star wars universe make it stand out as something different then even its its lead up movie. It mishandles many story arcs as if it forgets that it is a second part of a trilogy leaving few interesting plot hooks to its successor. Mark Hamill gave an amazing performance despite the film destroying the franchises most iconic hero\\, while propping a Mary Sue (Gary Stu if you will) to replace him. Character development is exchanged for CGI and a B plot that's rendered pointless near its conclusion. It has many situations that are taken from Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi\\, leaving Last Jedi look like a copy that doesn't understand the essence of the source material. Sadly Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill's last performance together is darkened by this films poor direction. As a fan from childhood and as a collector with a couple bookcases of books\\, movies and various forms of memorabilia feel like this movie hurts my overall star wars experience and will not be adding it to my collection.","true":true}
