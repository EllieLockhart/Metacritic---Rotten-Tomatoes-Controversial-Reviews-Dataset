Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I Subversive is great if executed well.  This hot mess becomes irritating and dumb.  Pretty set pieces and getting the look right doesn't save this troll job.  The subversive nature of the film feels terrible\\, hallow when packed with lazy writing and poor plot.","true":true}
