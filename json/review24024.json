Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mark Hamill went and studied acting. The best of a poor designee for the genesis of cinematic Galactic Empires. It started (A New Hope) with a spirituality composed on a cocktail napkin with snippets from Erhard Seminar Training - EST and would be followed by far more sophisticated and emotionally meaningful fiction (Alien\\, Blade Runner\\, etc.) by better writers and directors. Let's face it\\, the children that loved A New Hope are still of the same mindset if they don't like The Last Jedi. This is the first that didn't actually make me cringe.","true":true}
