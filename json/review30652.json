Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Since a fan from the begining. This movie looks like the end of \\\"the force\\\". Bored and asleeped as never before. Sorry but this film turns the one of Jar-jar Binks - larger deprecated in the saga - into a level like Gone with the wind. Scared to see what Episode IX will bring to us. Please\\, be The Force with realizators. Please don't throw away 42 years of dreams and tradition.","true":true}
