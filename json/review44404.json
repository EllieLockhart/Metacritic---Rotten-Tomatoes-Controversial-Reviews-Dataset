Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many unnecessary side stories. No character development. Snoke-dissappointing story. Luke-story isn't believable and spits in the face of all the points you know from all other Jedi in history. Rose-shoehorned into the plot as a SJW. First Order-completely inept as far as battle tactics and common sense. Far too much comedy for a movie with such a serious tone. Sorry I didn't wait for the bootleg.","true":true}
