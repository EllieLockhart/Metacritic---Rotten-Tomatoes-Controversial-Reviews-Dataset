And I wonder...why?!Why I shouldn't rate this game low? I bought it with my money and I expected a lot more from Naughty Dog.Sure you can call me dumb because I don't understand \\\"art\\\"...But...let me explain my feelings first:What's art?  I'm sure everyone has his definition and it's really difficult to define it because it deals with feelings. But I think it's easier to define what's not art. Courage decisions are NOT art! Courage decisions are courage decisions! I can play the piano in front of a paying audience with my elbows...sure a courage decision\\, but I can't blame the audience if doesn't understand my \\\"art\\\". I don't want to spoiler anything but regarding the story\\, this game is written very bad. It's not the events that happens but HOW they happen! The gamer will feel manipulated for 90% of the game.Really Naughty Dog is all they have to give after 7 years? The gameplay is better than the first TLOU because now you can jump\\, dodje and lay down (finally in 2020!).There are very long boring sections where you really don't know where to go. Sure\\, it's a Naughty Dog characteristic but please\\, listen to the gamers sometimes. I Know \\\"artist's\\\" ego can become too big sometimes...but\\, Naughty Dog should listen to the gamers more.Regarding graphics\\, I think they did a great job. That's the best part of the entire game. But it should be by default for flagship company with unmeasurable budjet.Really a bad experience overall\\, I wish I could go back in time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
