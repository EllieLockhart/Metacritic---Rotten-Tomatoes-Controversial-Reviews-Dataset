Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We finally get to see a movie where the Empire is scary\\, efficient\\, powerful.  All of the crazy last ditch attempts? Yeah\\, almost all of them fail.  I love how the \\\"leadership\\\" continually tries to teach Poe that trying to be a \\\"Hero\\\" isn't what being a hero is.  In the end\\, when the force users show up and meaningfully change how the story goes\\, its dramatic and meaningful.  Suddenly the value and power of the force users is more meaningful than ever before\\, not in some subtle way thats hard to understand\\, this isn't a religion of \\\"Faith\\\"\\, force users are literally that powerful and having one on your side in a war is like having a WMD.  On a different point\\, I loved how this movie felt like a scifi instead of a space opera.  The director made sure you could see all of the different things that make this world work\\, this is a living\\, breathing universe\\, not a hollow shell for the drama to play out in.  Fantastic movie\\, especially for scifi lovers who might have disliked star wars in the past.","true":true}
