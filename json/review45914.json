Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"VII is the new I. A few passable ideas scattered through a big pile of shit. I felt like I was watching a \\\"millenial\\\" parody. Not  that there is anything wrong with that in on itself\\, it's just that it doesn't fit the lore built by the previous movies.","true":true}
