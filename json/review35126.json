Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens may me feel giddy like a 10 year old child watching Star Wars again. This movie made me feel sad and confused... Rian Johnson made such a focused effort to subvert your expectations that you become numb to the random \\\"GOTCHA\\\" moments throughout this film. Conflict is created for the sake of conflict\\, and characters are beat down contrary to their established arcs just to elevate other characters. I love Rey\\, I love Jyn (I love strong women in general\\, Sarah Conner for example) but Holdo and Rose were horrible characters that were forced in to make a political point. It was either telling the audience that Poe is a moron hot shot loser\\, or that saving space horses is more important than the mission. This movie has criticisms of capitalism... the same capitalism that allowed Disney to buy a monopoly of the entertainment system... the same system that makes them billions of dollars per year. I don't need to be preached at in my Star Wars\\, I need to escape to a Galaxy Far Far Away. \\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nNegatives\\n\\n- Horrible new characters\\n- Previous characters are totally uncharacteristic and untrue to themselves\\n- Rian Johnson Breaks the Force\\n- #JusticeforAkbar\\n\\nPositives\\n\\n- Throne room\\n- Hyperspace (even though it breaks canon)\\n- Adam Driver's performance","true":true}
