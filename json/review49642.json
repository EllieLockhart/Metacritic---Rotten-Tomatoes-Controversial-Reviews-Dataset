Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. This movie was THE BEST movie I have ever seen. All the backlash from fans of the series is just\\, well\\, Sad. Spoiler free review: It rocks. It completely blew away my expectations\\, so 10\/10\\, GO WATCH IT!\\nFull review:\\nBefore this movie came out\\, I was really hoping to see less of Rey\\, and more of Finn. And\\, that's what happened. First of all\\, fins Chemistry with his partner\\, Rose is amazing! When rose was announced\\, I thought that was great\\, but deep down I thought she would get Zero screen time\\, like Boba fett In The empire strikes back\\, but surprisingly\\, her character was pretty much perfect\\, and was plain AWESOME! Now\\, I'm not a Fan of rey\\, but she was actually good in this movie\\, with good acting and a good character arc with Ben Solo. Speaking of Ben\\,  a lot of people dislike his character\\, because he acts like a baby (Which he does) But great acting relieves Ben's character\\, with Adam Driver doing the best he can to support his unstable character\\, which he does. Then\\, there's Luke Who\\, (BIG SPOILER) Dies. Now this probably upset die hard star wars fans\\, but in my opinion a die hard fan is someone who likes everything that comes out of something\\, Even Jar jar. But I thought luke Dying was cool\\, especially the way they did it\\, a homage to Obi-Wan's death in A new Hope. And I was surprised Leia DIDN'T die. But\\, the biggest question this film leaves Is: Who the $%&* is the kid with the mop? Those slaves are really interesting\\, so I think they could have their own trilogy\\, the one previously announced set in a far corner of the galaxy\\, (Maybe) The casino place.","true":true}
