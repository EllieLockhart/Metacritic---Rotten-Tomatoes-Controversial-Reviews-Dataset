Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As movies go\\, it was fun and entertaining.  As Star Wars movies go\\, it was a let down.  The original Star Wars characters were not portrayed true to character.  This movie is trying to pass the baton to the younger generation.  However\\, the new characters are probably not strong enough to carry it forward.  We have no reason to care about them.  People largely came to see what has happened to the beloved characters who have been part of our lives for over 40 years.  Well\\, now we know and it was a let down.  Honestly\\, by the time this movie was over there was nothing to bring me back for a third.  It felt like everything was wrapped up.  After Force Awakens we couldn't wait for this film.  After this film\\, I don't care about the next.  They lost the continuity that tied these films together.  Star Wars\\, as we knew it\\, is finished.","true":true}
