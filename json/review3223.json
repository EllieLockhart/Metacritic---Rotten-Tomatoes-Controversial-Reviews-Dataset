Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautifully shot and  wonderfully acted with compelling new characters (shout out to Kelly Marie Tran). I love the overall message of The Last Jedi\\, but it suffers from too many lousy story beats. CGI horse races\\, giant spaceships running out of fuel\\, a jaded Luke Skywalker\\, characters making bad decisions seemly just for plot reasons... I don't hate this movie\\, but it will be a very long time before I want to rewatch it.","true":true}
