Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pays homage to the original trilogy (mostly nods to \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" and \\\"Return of the Jedi\\\") but does so without being derivative or predictable. Completely unexpected and different from anything that's come before it and\\, yet\\, still awesome in its own right. Go see it!","true":true}
