Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Success and failure are at the forefront of 2017s newest entry to a saga from a Galaxy Far\\, Far Away in Star Wars: The Last Jedi-sides to a coin that are deeply rooted in the franchise in both a thematic way (the Light\/Dark Side) and a literal one as well (the Original Trilogy as a whole massive successes\\, the Prequel Trilogy as a whole massive failures) -and what it means to succeed or fail at something and the gray in between. Writer\/director Rian Johnson seems to understand these thematic elements that have lifted the collective imaginations of fans for decades by challenging what we know (or at least what we think we know)\\, yet giving us a new lens to view them in satisfying and surprising ways and has also given us an excellent Star Wars film that can proudly confirm that the Sequel Trilogy are in good hands. The best looking Star Wars film made (to date)\\, Johnson's cinematic eye is the perfect match for this space opera\\, delivering lush spectacle to add to the franchise's many iconic moments. But Star Wars is more than beautiful scenery and space battles (which this has) and the most vital aspect that makes these worth watching is the story and characters\\, which Johnson has confidently delivered on. Picking up where J.J. Abrams' 2015 The Force Awakens left us\\, Johnson has delivered a middle chapter that is darker in tone and narrative (similar to 1980s The Empire Strikes Back\\, the go-to map for a sequel) that challenges our new cast (Daisy Ridley's Rey\\, John Boyega's Finn\\, Oscar Isacc's Poe and Adam Driver's Kylo... with some new faces) as well as the old (Mark Hamill's Luke and the late Carrie Fisher's Leia)\\, ultimately enriching them in character and drive that will make Episode IX's finale something to look forward to. For all the success that Johnson pours from the Star Wars well into Episode VIII\\, there are some wobbles here and there (that may remind some of the failure that is the Prequels) but as a whole\\, The Last Jedi is a satisfying\\, character-driven lesson in franchise filmmaking that many should learn from.","true":true}
