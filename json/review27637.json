Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pacing\\, irrelevant non consequential subplotlines (Poe mutiny and Finn\/Rose)\\, underuse of Mark Hamil and raising more questions than answers holds this movie back and will be most Star Wars fan's least favorite movie.\\n\\n3 minutes of lightsabers with no true duel\\, not acceptable.\\n\\n2 minutes of Phasma\\, sure glad we got connected to that character.\\n5 minutes of X-wing and space dogfights\\, not acceptable.\\nNo funeral or remembrence of Han\\, limited character development.","true":true}
