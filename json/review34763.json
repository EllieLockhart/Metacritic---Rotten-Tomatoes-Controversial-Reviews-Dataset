Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The difference between a Social Activist (like me\\, or any other Star Wars fan) and a Social Justice Warrior (SJW) like Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney in general:\\n\\nSocial Activist: \\\"Oh\\, look\\, there's no wheelchair ramps into that building - Let's build a ramp!\\\"\\n\\nSJW: \\\"Let's persecute (and possibly slap in the face) the people using the stairs and make them feel bad for having legs!\\\"\\n\\nIf you substitute \\\"people having legs\\\" with \\\"males\\\" or \\\"white people\\\" or \\\"wealthy people\\\" or simply \\\"Star Wars fans\\\"\\, you get The Last Jedi.\\n\\nI felt humiliated and insulted by this movie and will surely avoid watching next installments of the Star Wars franchise by Disney. And will never buy a Disney toy again.","true":true}
