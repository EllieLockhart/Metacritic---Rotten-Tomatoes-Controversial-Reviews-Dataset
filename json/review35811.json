Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi isn\u2019t a perfect movie\\, but it was willing to take chances and not play into the desires of fanboys. The movie could have been shorter\\, but that has been true of most Star Wars movies. Comparing this to Rouge One isn\u2019t fair because everyone knew how that had to end. We have reached the point where some Star Wars fans will never be happy\\, no matter what happens in one of these films. ","true":true}
