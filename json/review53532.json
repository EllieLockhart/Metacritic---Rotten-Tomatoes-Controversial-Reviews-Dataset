Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"EPIC!  Star Wars: The Last Jedi is simply amazing\\, and inspiring. Just watched the premiere and the moment the traditional opening crawl came on with the Star Wars anthem - the hall just erupted with cheers. There was so much excitement and joy\\, and it felt good that the wait was finally over. True enough\\, it was well worth the wait.  The Last Jedi is a very emotional ride from start to finish.  It is filled with humour and tears\\, great dialogue and acting. When the film ended\\, everyone just clapped. Yes\\, it was very satisfying. Superb story telling\\, and this is where Disney always gets it right:  the CGI supports the story and never overwhelms it. The Last Jedi is rich with allegory\\, a remarkable feat to be showing this eighth episode\\, very much like for a modern generational myth with a Shakespearean narrative created for difficult modern times such as this.  The Last Jedi inspires with great stories of heroism\\, hope and purpose in the face of loss\\, tragedy and despair.  There's plenty of incredible battle and action scenes and of course\\, light saber sequences from start to finish\\, and well paced with great character development. The ensemble cast is simply amazing - despite some having fewer lines that the rest\\, their character arcs were simply solid\\, that you'd wish they had more! Actors who really shine through would be Adam Driver\\, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. Adam Driver brings out Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo as the conflicted\\, multi-dimensional baddie of the film - and he is really good. Mark Hamill is simply in his element as the mature Luke Skywalker.  The editing is tight\\, and the direction is impressive. There's so much detail and hard work poured into the CGI that any fan would feel so very satisfied. I'm watching again for sure. The Star Wars universe was created for cinema\\, and what a tale this has been\\, as the story unravels across the generations\\, watching the actors passing on the baton\\, and we fans growing up with this franchise and now sharing with the next generations to come. This in itself is a feat. Thank you\\, George Lucas for creating this. Thank you\\, Disney for taking this to the next generation. I'm Episode VIII watching again. Can't wait for Episode IX.","true":true}
