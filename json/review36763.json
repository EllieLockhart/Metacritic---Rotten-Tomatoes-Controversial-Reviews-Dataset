Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie per se was not bad but it lacked a meaningful plot and character development. I still don't understand why Luke had to die\\, he was the only charismatic character left alive (Kylo and Ray are just dumb kids) and the silly way he \\\"departed\\\" is preposterous. How the hell Rian Johnson came up with this pile of crap? Just spare us an Episode 9\\, I don't even know why I should watch it honestly.","true":true}
