Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It stomped on the graves of the original trilogy. It took everything in new bizarre directions-like Leia's brand new ability to fly through space with her hand or Luke's new ability to make holograms of himself appear all across the galaxy. The tone of the film and the placement of jokes feels like a Marvel film rather than a Star Wars film. Not to mention the fact that the film reads like political propaganda.","true":true}
