Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not an alt-right\\, fanboy\\, or Trump supporter. You could literally write a novel about how bad this movie was and all the things wrong with it.                   Anyone who isn't a complete idiot knows this movie just plain sucked.     The only trolls are the people who are giving this movie 5 stars. I've been    reading lots of reviews and I have come across at least 3 where people            said it wasn't that great but gave it five stars to balance things out.    Seriously people\\, what Fuck is that! Star Wars is dead-er than Donald  Trumps hair. If Disney sold the rights to Elon Musk and he announced it  would be directed by Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino\\, I still  wouldn't go see part 9. Fuck you very much Disney.   \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPS: if you get a chance read Peter Travers' review of this movie\\, it'll make  your stomach turn. What a sellout\\, your a disgrace Peter. Rolling Stone?  You be should be writing reviews for Time magazine\\, or AARP. Tool!","true":true}
