Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematics were great and the story in itself was good. But I completely felt cheated. The Force Awakens gave us many questions that were just squandered away. I felt like this was a total cop-out. I would love for Disney to do a re-do of the Last Jedi before moving on to Ep.9. Ugh\\, why am I alway let down by studios.","true":true}
