Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the best Star Wars movie in a long time.  Finally\\, there are no more of the same plot devices that have been recycled to death\\, namely Death Stars.  And the Skywalker family is being put out to pasture like they should have been three movies ago. One plot device that bothered me about episode 1 through 6 was that The Force is supposed to be in all things\\, but why was it only the Skywalkers who were able to use it immediately?  I was not a fan of the Force Awakens because it had another Death Star in it with a suicidal\\, last ditch attack by the Rebels to blow it up.  I've seen that too many times already.  I am so glad that The Last Jedi began to move the franchise forward away from the Royal Family of the Force\\, aka Skywalker clan.  The last scene showed clearly the Force is accessible to all\\, even stable boys\\, and not just for the few elite in the Jedi or Sith.  \\n\\nDisney team\\, keep it up!  Like Kylo Ren says (again and again)\\, \\\"Let the past die.  Kill it if you have to!\\\"","true":true}
