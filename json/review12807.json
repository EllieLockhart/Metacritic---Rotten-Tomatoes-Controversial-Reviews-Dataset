Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not enjoy this movie at all. You could have easily removed the entire center portion of the film and still not miss anything. It's opened too many plot holes and everything they built in Episode 7 was pissed on and discarded for what felt like no continuation of the previous movie.  They ruined Luke's character that was built on over 40 years and relied too much once again on trying to quickly establish a new plot. Absolutely crap.","true":true}
