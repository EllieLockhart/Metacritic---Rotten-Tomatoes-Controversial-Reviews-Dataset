Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a star wars fan for my entire 20 years of existence I can say this was the most dissatisfaction I have ever had. Luke skywalker is not the luke i remember. He can be broken and lose faith in the jedi\\, but for him to be treated as he was in this film is disgusting. No hero should ever be treated this way. Please disney let the future die not the past because a dang movie made in 1977 is 100 times better than a movie made in 2017. I will always love star wars and luke skywalker but something must be done to fix this wrong. No plot\\, no feeling\\, no emotions to this trilogy or the characters in it. I can say i wouldnt care if rey or who evere dies\\, i can still see obi wan sacrifice himself for the hundreth time and still feel the tears that i had the first time I saw that movie. The past reigns mighty compared to this new generation.","true":true}
