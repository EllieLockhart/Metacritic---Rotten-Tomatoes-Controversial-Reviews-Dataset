Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what movie the critics have been watching. This was easily my least favorite Star Wars movie ever. All treatment of the characters\\, there are plot holes and poor acting in places (I really didn't like Laura Dern's character or her performance). Rose seemed like an interesting character\\, but somehow it seemed a bit forced. The whole trip to the casino to find a guy wearing a flower? What? How does she know he'll be there? Everything mysterious that Episode VII set up? All made irrelevant by this one. No answers\\, or stupid ones. Yet the critics love it. Guess there's something wrong with me\\, because I'm incredibly disappointed.","true":true}
