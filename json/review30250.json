Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"saw the movie in theaters and was not impressed. compared to the other star wars movies and video game plots\\, this one was so lackluster and wasn't clever at all. I didn't understand what Rian johnson was going for  in this movie but it was lame. I tend to keep an open mind when watching movies and i had to watch this again on blu ray to confirm if it was as bad as it was in theaters and I regret wasting my time yet again. I'M hoping episode 9 can save my hope for this trilogy because honestly the star wars magic was not in this movie at all though I will praise the visuals.","true":true}
