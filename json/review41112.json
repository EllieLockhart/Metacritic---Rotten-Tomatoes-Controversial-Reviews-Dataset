Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had some hits in it\\, but with all of the hits\\, there were just as many misses\\, if not more. The portrayal of Kylo Ren's internal conflict was expertly done\\, however the relationship between him and Rey has left me puzzled\\, confused\\, disappointed...but wanting more. The occasional blooper-like scenes were enjoyable. The biggest complaint\\, however\\, has to be Leia's apparent forced (no pun intended) presence.  There was too much of her\\, and not enough of the characters that should have been developed in a deeper way. Overall it was enjoyable\\, but was obviously a nostalgia-grab.","true":true}
