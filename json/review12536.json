Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can\u2019t believe how disappointed I was with this movie. The story is small and done very poorly. Essentially empire strikes back where they never really escape from Hoth. I can completely see why Mark Hamill had reservations about the portrayal of Luke in this movie. Where he started was where he ended up. See it once to make your own opinion. But that\u2019s all you going to want. ","true":true}
