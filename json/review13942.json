Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you didn't grow up with the original 3.....and didn't read the \\\"Old Canon\\\" books from Thrawn to Legends of the Jedi....you may like this movie.\\n\\nTotal garbage if you DID grow up with the 1977\\, 1980\\, and 1983 movies.","true":true}
