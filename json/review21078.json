Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was totally on board for this film. I awaited to see the what was going to happen to these characters after the set-up from the Force Awakens. However\\, what I got was a boring\\, disjointed film\\, that was a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise\\, which I have supported since May 25th\\, 1977. Unless Lucasfilm\/Disney can clean up their act\\, I am now DONE with these films and be content with the better films in this series. A true MUST-MISS film!","true":true}
