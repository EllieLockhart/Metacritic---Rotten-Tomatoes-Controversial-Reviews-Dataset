Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible.  Just terrible.  I am totally fine with the basic essence of the Rey-Kylo-Luke story in this movie.  The problem is it is surrounded by a godawful movie with gaping plot holes\\, nonsensical action\\, and ultimately no real character development beyond a few key figures dying.\\n\\nAnd to be clear - I liked the last one.  Sure it was a retread but there was enough new stuff in there.  But for this movie to be good it absolutely needed to go into new and fresh territory.  Yet despite what the writer\/director and critics may think\\, this movie is a horrible retread of earlier movies - especially Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nBasically\\, the supposed cleverness is to take what you think you know about Star Wars and invert it.  So....Hoth is an ice planet?  Now it is a red planet with a salty surface.  Hoth is supposed to happpen at he start of the movie\\, now it happens at the end.  Transport ships are supposed to flee Hoth?  Now they race towards it.  Just one of the many example of lazy\\, lazy retreading.\\n\\nBut even if you have never seen or care about the Star Wars universe\\, this is just a terrible movie in any frame of reference owing to the utter lack of character arch (unless you are named Kylo)\\, storylines that go nowhere and make no sense\\, the complete absence of a meaningful and menacing villain (no Kylo does not operate as a villain here)\\, stupid humor that mostly focuses on poking fun at others\/awkward interpersonal moments\\, and the lack of any real sense of what the heck is going on.  We are two movies in and we have no idea what the First Order - especially there rulers - want other than we are just supposed to assume that because it is Star Wars that villains want to rule the galaxy.\\n\\nNo\\, this is not a fresh and clever take on Star Wars.  It is a purposeless\\, stupid\\, ill-conceived retread.","true":true}
