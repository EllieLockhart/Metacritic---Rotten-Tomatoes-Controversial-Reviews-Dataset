Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand that that new characters where needed\\, but this has proved to be a nail in the coffin. The director basically said \\\"let's ignore everything good from the original trilogy and go a new way. we don't need heroes\\, story lines or character development because we have a CGI and a really bad script\\\". The galactic hero\\, Luke\\, became the zero ( I was half expecting to hear \\\"Get off my lawn\\\"). If Han had survived\\, they could have stole the name \\\"Grumpy Old Men\\\". At least\\, I won't waste my money anything else Star Wars related.","true":true}
