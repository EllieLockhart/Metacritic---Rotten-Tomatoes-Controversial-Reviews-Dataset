Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What they did with Luke Skywalker was blasphemous. Kathleen Kennedy takes a HUGE dump on this beloved franchise.  This movie has its cool moments\\,  but in the same breath I rather have a conversation with Jar Jar for all eternity than to watch this again.  SOOOOOOOO many plot holes it hurt my brain.  Again\\,  THIS is not what Luke Skywalker was suposed to be... giant miss by the mouse house.","true":true}
