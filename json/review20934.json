Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was excited for this movie\\, and I remember going opening night. Now\\, I'm a fan who will willingly go to the theaters to rewatch the Phantom Menace in 3D (and I hate 3D). I love the prequels\\, I love almost everything star wars related\\, and even with all it's flaws\\, I enjoy Force Awakens (it was a rehash\\, and Rey was to perfect of a character\\, but it had promise). With this though\\, it's the first time that I didn't want to rewatch it\\, I didn't want to go back and see it again\\, I don't even want to go see Solo or 9. That's a problem if a fan such as I\\, who eats up almost everything star wars doesn't even want to see it or other things from this current trilogy any longer.","true":true}
