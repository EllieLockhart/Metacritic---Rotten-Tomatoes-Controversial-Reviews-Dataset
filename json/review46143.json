Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visuals were amazing but this movie was all over the place.  Introduced a \\\"hero\\\" character that I felt was forced into the natural flow of what was already a solid hero lineup. Then they overplayed the jar jar like character of Finn\\, just not sure what they are trying to do there.  Seeing Leia fly through space like \\\"Star Lord\\\" was too much.  Just felt like this movie was all over the place and in trying to do so much ended up doing very little and so very slowly.  Disappointed and disenchanted  47 year old and My 9 and 12 year olds were bored and restless throughout.  Breaks my heart to say in kinda sooked.","true":true}
