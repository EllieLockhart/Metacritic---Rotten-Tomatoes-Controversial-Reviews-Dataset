Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An honourable legacy and ode to a fantastic saga of there ever was one. Character development was seeping through the pores of the movie\\, telling a great tale that had as much action as it did emotion. Some real standout performances from Adam Driver and from the lady that took over command from Leia (Her name escapes me). I've seen it twice already and plan to see it again. It is a perfect balance of original saga essence and modern day cinematography. Plus that lightspeed scene was just awesome!","true":true}
