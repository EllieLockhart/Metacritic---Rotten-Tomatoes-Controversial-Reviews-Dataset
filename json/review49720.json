Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Written by a 12 year old fan boy with Attention Deficit Disorder. The plot doesn't make sense\\, rules established in previous films are ignored\\, there's lots of melodrama over nothing at all\\, random characters are introduced with random plot lines that serve no purpose. A total mess. Star Wars ended with Return of the Jedi 20 years ago.","true":true}
