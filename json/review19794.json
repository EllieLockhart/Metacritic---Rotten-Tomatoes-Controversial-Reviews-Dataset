Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was apparent that this movie was directed by a totally different person as much of the original ideas felt scrapped leaving a what now feeling that made me lose a lot of interest in the saga.","true":true}
