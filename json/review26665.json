Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok in my opinion to like the film you have to remember what exactly the Force is described by Luke in the movie. For me I loved the movie and plan on seeing it again. People comparing ito the phantom\\nmenace I think you've been smoking too much pot.","true":true}
