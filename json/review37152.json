Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason this was not the WORST Start Wars movie was because Luke was in it. The way they portrayed Luke was horrible. Luke is not a bumbling idiot who is moderately good at Jedi fighting he is eager\\, witty and fights the darkness. BREAKING NEWS: Disney has officially ruined Star Wars. Disney made serious moments silly. There was no Jedi vs Jedi fighting. This was a complete disgrace to the Star Wars legacy. George Lucas\\, please save us\\, you are our only hope. God speed and may the Force be with you.","true":true}
