Nah let them creep away?\\nLuke's death was shit! \\nLuke's a coward?\\nI would love to see episode 10 redo this one and\\nsee it's all a dream and we could see Mark Hamills version. Sadly it's got so many flaws. It had a few nice moments it's nice to see Leia use the force but not this","true":true}
