Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an inconsistent pile of garbage.\\n\\nThe plot makes no sense at all and they completely disregarded The Force Awakens. \\n\\nNevermind the fact that Leia can fly and people can breathe and use gravity in space.\\n\\nThey turned the Force into magic. They turned Luke Skywalker into a jerk who contemplates MURDERING the son of his sister and best friends. The thing is\\, I would be fine with all of this if they took the time and creativity to explain all of this nonsenwe\\, but they didn't even do that.\\n\\nThis \\\"movie\\\" is a true slap in the face.","true":true}
