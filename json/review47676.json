Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Whenever someone on the internet talks about the last Jedi 60% of the time they say negative things about it. From \\\"the movie has no plot\\\" to \\\"they ruined Luke Skywalker\\\". I for one think the movie is good. Especially the final act. The poetry of the concept of \\\"we will always learn from our pupils. That is the true burden of a master\\\" is truly beautiful. Those little force conversations between Rey and Kylo ren taught Luke how to project himself across the galaxy. Luke died a beautiful and powerful death.","true":true}
