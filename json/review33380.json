Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Take note\\, I am NOT a Star Wars fan. In fact\\, I only got hooked because I found that I liked The Force Awakens and Rogue One. I was indifferent to both the Original Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy. So I am not a disgruntled fanboy who was disappointed that my pet theories were not picked up. Rather\\, I was a NEW fan who had only the highest hopes and optimism but was DISAPPOINTED by the final product. I had buyers remorse even though it was my brother who paid for the tickets.\\n\\nEnumerating the many disappointments would have been tedious. Just suffice to say\\, I want to turn back the clock and just spend the time at home\\, watching or reading something else--anything else!","true":true}
