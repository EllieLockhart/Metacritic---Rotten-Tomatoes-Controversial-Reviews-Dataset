Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really just thought the movie was disjointed and poorly developed in a lot of places. Even without cannon\\, this movie barely made any sense. Definitely recommend waiting until cable\\, not sure I'd even rent it if I had it to do over.","true":true}
