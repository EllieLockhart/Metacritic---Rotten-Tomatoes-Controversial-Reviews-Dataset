Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was. I've been a lifelong Star Wars fan (okay\\, technically only since I was about 7)\\, and I consumed just about every Star Wars narrative I could get my hands on\\, regardless of format. Some of those stories were amazing\\, better than the original trilogy\\, and some were hot garbage\\, created with the mindset that if you put \\\"Star Wars\\\" on something\\, people will buy it. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" fits firmly into the latter category. While at times visually stunning\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" fails to tell a coherent story\\, provide adequate plot development\\, or even just provide us with fun entertainment. Well-developed\\, established characters are squandered\\, while their replacements languish in forgettable mediocrity. Clearly\\, the only intended purpose of this film is to serve as a social and political manifesto\\, but that socio-political zealotry commits the worst possible sin: destroying its own credibility by sucking the life out the thin shell that is the rest of the movie. I fail to see how watching someone destroy a great franchise with heavy-handed political messaging and characters that belong in the uncanny valley of a brain-dead morality play is supposed to make me sympathize with their viewpoint. How fucked up is it that in a theoretically feminist movie\\, the only three-dimensional characters are men?That's just fucking lazy. I honestly have no interest in seeing whatever garbage they throw at me next; if I want Star Wars content\\, I'll go find one of the old novels that I haven't read yet. All that said\\, though\\, I have to end on one positive note: the ironing scene was brilliant\\, and I loved it. If only it wasn't the one reprieve from an ocean of asininity.","true":true}
