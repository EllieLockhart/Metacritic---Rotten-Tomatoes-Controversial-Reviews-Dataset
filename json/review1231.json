Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A potentially good movie ruined by bad script and a ridiculously awful plot. I won't even get started on how distant it was from the canon. Trying to add humour by making major characters look like idiots at times was a mistake that will cost Disney. The original characters deserved far more respect and better treatment than what they got. Constantly changing the roster of characters removes a lot of depth from the trilogy and more people will realise it in the long run. Now I'm certain that Disney only knows how to appeal to children and people with small brains","true":true}
