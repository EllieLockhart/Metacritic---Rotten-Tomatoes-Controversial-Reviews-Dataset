Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this movie.  2:30 hours of red herrings and pointless dead ends with prequel-esque absurdity. Very disappointing. Solid performances from Driver and Ridley are wasted on an asinine script. Perhaps most egregious - this film makes the first movie in this new trilogy mostly irrelevant.","true":true}
