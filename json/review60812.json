It's a game that takes many bold risks\\, which I find hard not to admire. Naughty Dog could have easily phoned in a sequel to try and please everyone\\, yet its decision to take the narrative in an unpredictable direction almost immediately and fully commit to it without compromising is very respectable.\r\rHowever\\, the narrative is not without its flaws. My biggest issue with it is the pacing. With a shift in perspective around halfway through\\, the narrative momentum completely crashes and the game begins to feel very long. By the time the end does come\\, it feels like it could have been cut short by at least 4 or 5 hours.\r\rI can't find many criticisms for the gameplay\\, as I feel it improved upon the first game in every way. While the gameplay is pretty much the same\\, it is more refined and polished. The acting is also fantastic across the board\\, with Laura Bailey standing out to me as the highlight. It's not easy to take such a controversial role on\\, but she knocked it out the park.\r\rOverall\\, this is not as good as the first game - which was more focussed and its message more relatable - but I have to respect this sequel for its sheer audacity for not following what was expected of it. The creators had a story to tell\\, and they told it. That takes balls.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
