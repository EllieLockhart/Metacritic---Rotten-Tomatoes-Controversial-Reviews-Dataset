Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi delivers in ways I was not expecting. Perhaps the most pleasant surprise being how much the women in this film were the moral compass-- and basically calling out men for their over simplistic thinking. Whether it be Admiral Holdo and Poe's realization that sometimes leadership is more than flashy plans and rash thinking. Rose speaking truth to Finn about what it means to be devoted to a cause. Rey's conversations with both Luke and Kylo stress the importance of looking past ego and past mistakes. On top of this\\, characters all faced challenges that helped them to grow into more complete\\, full\\, complex\\, characters. The film was sprinkled with small moments powerfully placed\\, but also balanced with truly funny moments. TLJ is the perfect middle chapter of a new saga that reckons with the question\\, what does it mean to fail and where do you go from there?","true":true}
