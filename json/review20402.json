Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand the pain most super fans feel after watching this movie\\, however just because a film doesn't live up to your expectations\\, is new\\, or recreates the feeling you got whilst watching the originals doesn't make it a bad film. I am not saying this film is perfect\\, it has flaws\\, the subplot was out of tone and few characters were thrown in with no character development or story purpose. In the end this film remains memorable and fresh.","true":true}
