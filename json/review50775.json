Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful looking movie\\, so the critics will enjoy that. But can we make now a Star Wars movie? Or at least don't call this episode 8\\, if Rian needed to do his spin on the SW lore. This doesn't follow any internal pre-established characters or aspects of the situation we're in (considering it follows TFA about a week or so). What was set up in the original trilogy or in TFA is gone now.","true":true}
