Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the worst Star Wars movies in a long time. So many wrong decisions with characters\\, and a lot of unnecessary scenes. \\n\\nThe only decent thing about it is the effects\\, which seem fairly average compared to the visual spectacle George Lucas wanted to achieve with the original films and the prequels.\\n\\nHad any thoughts about what was going to happen from the Force Awakens? Well get ready\\, it's all thrown out the door in this film. Many things teased in Episode 7 are not explained or are underwhelmed here.\\n\\nInteresting characters from the original like Luke Skywalker are looked over in favour of the \\\"new\\\" cast\\, whose decisions in this film are nonsensical\\, almost entire scenes where there is no advancement of the plot\\, the audiences' time is wasted.\\n\\nThis Star Wars movie lacks the emotional and interesting storyline and characters of the Original Trilogy\\, and the lack of appealing visual performances of the Prequels. It just isn't a good Star Wars movie.","true":true}
