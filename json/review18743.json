Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a good action movie but it's not a good star war movie. \\nThey waste a lot: the emblematic characters\\, the new ones\\, the villains\\, the story. The narration is not fluid and there are very inessential things. In spite of everything the film is correct forgetting everything that could have been in the extensive universe of star war.","true":true}
