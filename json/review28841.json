Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Read George Lucas's response to this movie\\, he approves it! We would've gotten something similar is he directed the sequels himself! I've been a fan ever since 1977 so everyone get over it\\, we can't have the same actors play Star Wars forever just like the old Star Trek movies. A new cast has to come along at some point! The new trilogy is FAR BETTER than the prequels!","true":true}
