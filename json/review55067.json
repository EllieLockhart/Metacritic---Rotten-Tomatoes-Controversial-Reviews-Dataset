Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen The Last Jedi twice\\, and it's the worst Star Wars film ever made. Rian Johnson took all of the cool plots from The Force Awakens and killed them off in the most underwhelming ways.\\n\\nThe Luke in this movie is absolutely nothing like the Luke Skywalker of the original trilogy. Humor falls flat.","true":true}
