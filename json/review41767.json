Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is phenomenal. The number of bait-and-switches keeps you on the absolute edge of your seat the whole movie. The characters are heart-wrenchingly complex and emotional charged. The references and attributions to the original trilogy are splendid. And the execution is flawless. There's moments to laugh\\, cry\\, jump\\, and relax throughout the movie allowing the viewer to feel the production rather than just watch it. Every second is a surprise\\, yet every moment feels familiar. I think they did a masterful job producing this movie. There is one 30-second shot where I was confused and disappointed\\, but the rest of the movie is masterful.","true":true}
