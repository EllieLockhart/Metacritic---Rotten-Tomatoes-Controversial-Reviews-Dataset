Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up for this website just so I could review and let people know how BAD this movie is. I love star wars\\, and this officially RUINED the trilogy. It was no actor's fault; whoever directed and wrote the script for this movie (Rian Johnson?) is to blame.\\n\\nI won't spoil anything\\, but man\\, this movie was bad. So many plot holes\\, and too much attempt at comedy\\, when it's a star wars movie\\, and should have depth and seriousness like episodes 1-6 (especially 4-6). There are many other things as well\\, but I don't wanna ruin anything.\\n\\nAnyway\\, don't waste your time watching it. This trilogy is over.","true":true}
