Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"***Spoilers***\\n\\nThey squandered Luke & Holdo\\, gave Finn an afterthought plot that didn't go anywhere\\, and had Leia do a Mary Poppins impression.  Throw in some cringe Marvel movie humor and you have this movie.  The only bright spots were the Rey\/Kylo story line.  I didn't hate it\\, but I think JJ Abrams has some serious damage control to do for episode 9.","true":true}
