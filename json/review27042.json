Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best yet. I was on the edge of my seat and gasped more than I have ever gasped during a movie. I can't wait to watch it over and over on blu-ray when it comes out.","true":true}
