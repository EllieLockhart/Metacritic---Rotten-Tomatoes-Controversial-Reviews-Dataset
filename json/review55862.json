Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Question: Can a Star Wars Movie be made that is worse than the prequels? The answer is Yes. And that movie is Star Wars: the Last Jedi. This movie seemed to be more interested in cheap gags\\, visuals\\, cliched dialog\\, character Cameos\\, and a few too many attempts a forced sentimentality. What was a two and half hour movie seemed to drag on for much longer than that as an incoherent story seemed to drag along trying to find a plot and a decent way to end. Speaking of ending\\, I asked myself at least twice\\, when the movie seemed to reach a conclusion\\, yet continued on\\, \u201cWhen is this movie going to end?\u201d Even my youngest son asked after the movie was over\\, \u201cThat was a long movie\\, how long were we in there\\, four hours?\u201d His brother told him\\, \u201cNo\\, only 2 hours and 22 minutes.\u201d Only a true blue Star Wars Nerd might enjoy this one. What a disappointment!","true":true}
