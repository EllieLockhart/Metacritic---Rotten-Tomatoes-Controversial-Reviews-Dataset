Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars only lasted 8 days in China\\, world's biggest theater industry\\, before it was scrubbed from the theaters. Many theaters did not even show it. So before you say I'm not being honest\\, understand that this movie is considered GARBAGE by viewers the world over. The only thing that was cool was the empire killing 99% of the rebels. I enjoyed that but the story and characters are awful.","true":true}
