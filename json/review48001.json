Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not a 1\/2 out of 5\\, I feel obligated to review it as such to balance all the drones and bots reviewing this as a 5 out of 5.\\n\\nFundamentally destroys the character of luke skywalker turning him into a coward while pushing a series of preachy agendas\\, the movie is filled with pointless filler and disregards all questions presented by its predecesesor\\, barnished with a predictable glossy corporate hollywood finish. star wars is over","true":true}
