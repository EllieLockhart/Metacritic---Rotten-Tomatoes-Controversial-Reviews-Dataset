Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film does what an 'act two' second film in a trilogy should do- breaks expectations\\, characters\\, and establishes the base for success in the next film. Really great character arc for Luke and Rey. 1 star lost for a mid-movie story-line (Cantobite\/parking infringement) that doesn't go anywhere and is inconsequential... hard to watch in an otherwise well but together film.","true":true}
