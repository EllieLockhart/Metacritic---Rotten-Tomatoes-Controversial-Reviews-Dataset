Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing entry into the Star Wars franchise.  The overall story is very weak and forced \\\"No joke intended\\\".  The Force Awakens did a good job setting up some interesting story lines and character questions.   The Last Jedi delivered nothing in the way of answers and proved that certain characters were just HUGE wastes of a possible good background story.  I used to believe that Star Wars meant it was contract for me to like it.  After 9 movies this one finally released me from my contract.  This will be the first Star Wars movie that I will not pay for Multiple viewings in the Theater.","true":true}
