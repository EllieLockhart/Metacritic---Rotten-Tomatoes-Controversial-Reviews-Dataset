Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite all the deaths\\, the movie has no teeth. Luke is handled like a worthless antique piece instead of a beloved hero. His replacement Rey comes across as smug and lowly. Liea is strangely indestructible. Tran and Finn are moralizing losers\\, really uncool. Kylo turns out to be cool or at least more in step with the zeitgeist. The action sequences are weak. The tone is inconsistent and oddly repulsive. Gone is the Great Man theory of Leadership. What we have is a descent into anti-charisma. Rian Johnson should be directing Pitch Perfect sequels not Star Wars films. Half a star is me being generous.","true":true}
