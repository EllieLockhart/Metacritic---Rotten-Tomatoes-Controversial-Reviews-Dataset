Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This falls into the category of being a decent enough film\\, but a terrible Star Wars film. \\n\\n(SPOILERS)\\n\\nThe production itself is a high point. The film features exceptional shots\\, a well-put-together score (although not quite as good as TFA) and special effects we've come to expect from Lucasfilm. \\n\\nThere are moments of genuine surprise\\, suspense and emotion\\, and a plot that is exciting enough to be a relatively entertaining watch.\\n\\nHowever\\, beyond this is where the flaws start to show. The biggest flaw in this film is that it feels like a total disconnect from TFA and the saga as a whole. It feels as though Rian Johnson either didn't watch what J. J. Abrams set up in Episode VII or simply decided he didn't care and discarded it all. Why set up Snoke as a mysterious omnipotent evil just to kill him off in the cheapest way\\, with no revelation regarding his past? Why have Finn injured in the last film to have him be totally fine here? Why have the Knights of Ren even mentioned in TFA to completely ignore them here? Why have Kylo be fixated with Vader and his legacy to completely retcon that aspect of his character? Of course\\, the largest 'screw you' to the established material is the revelation concerning Rey's parents\\, which was a complete cop-out.\\n\\nFurthermore\\, the film takes Luke's character is a direction that is not at all consistent with his characterisation in any other film\\, book or established canon material and his death seems completely unwarranted and unnecessary. At the very least the fans who have been waiting years for his return would have appreciated a heroic\\, old-school Luke moment\\, instead of some cop-out astral projection. Additionally\\, despite Disney and Lucasfilm claiming Phasma was to be a larger part of the story this time around\\, she is again reduced to a handful of lines and goes out as quickly as she arrives as per TFA. What a complete waste of a great actress and interesting character.\\n\\nThe movie also suffers from 'Marvel-comedy-syndrome'\\, where there is far too many attempted comedy beats that fall completely flat and seem especially out of place considering the darker tone of the film\\, prime examples are the ridiculous CGI gaffs on the casino planet that seem like something straight out of Episode I.\\n\\nIf anything\\, this movie can be said to be wanting to have everything both ways. Leia is dead\\, wait no she's not. Luke's finally going to stand up and take on the First Order\\, wait no he isn't. Kylo's going to be reformed\\, wait no he isn't. Rey and Kylo have a unique cross-galaxy connection\\, wait no they don't. The movie just doesn't have the guts to make a commitment and make a bold decision. It's just so wishy-washy. \\n\\nThe casino planet sub-plot was also totally pointless and brought the entire movie to a halt\\, making the pacing feel constantly slowed. I like Finn and Rose\\, but that entire sequence amounted to absolutely nothing and was a waste of their characters.\\n\\nFinally\\, Yoda was cool.","true":true}
