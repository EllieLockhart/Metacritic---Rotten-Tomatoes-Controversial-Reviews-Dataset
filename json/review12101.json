Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am 48 years old. Therefore I have literally seen all of these movies in the theater my whole life. Before now the only movie in this series that really annoyed me or disappointed me was the introduction of Jar Jar Binks.  I came away from this movie actually disappointed and feeling it was just silly and not in a laughing way. It was actually more than halfway through the movie before I heard anyone laugh at anything. Don't rush out to see this or fight the crowds. If you have a good TV at home I would definitely recommend waiting for the rental which I never thought I would say about Star Wars but I am.","true":true}
