Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Devastatingly disappointing\\, with a weak story\\, moments that didn't feel right\\, and\\, most saddening\\, a terrible continuation of Luke Skywalker's legacy. Lots of characters have no\\, or very minimal\\, development and some of the noteable deaths should not have happened so early\\, within this new trilogy. \\n\\nThere were a few funny moments\\, that I definitely laughed at\\, but many of those felt misplaced\\, or didn't compliment the tone of the scene. I did enjoy most of the Kylo story\\, as well as Snoke's\\, but there were so many characters and ships that I just didn't care about.\\n\\nThe least Star Wars of all the movies\\, and also my least favourite. After seeing The Last Jedi\\, I genuinely value the prequels far more highly.","true":true}
