Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Please don\u2019t let the negative fan reviews dissuade you from seeing this movie. Form your own opinion by going to watch it. Personally I loved it! Yeah sure\\, there are aspects that make you go \u201chuh\\, that was unexpected\u201d\\, and yes\\, you will be confused. But don\u2019t forget\\, this is the 2nd movie in a TRILOGY! Meaning questions that this movie creates\\, and questions you still have from TFA will be answered in the next instalment. Also\\, if you find yourself asking \u201cWHO IS SNOKE?\u201d\\, think back to the original trilogy... were we ever told who The Emperor was? And did it really matter? If you go in with an open mind\\, and you are a TRUE Star Wars fan\\, you\u2019re going to love this movie. (Be ready for surprises)","true":true}
