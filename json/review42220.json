Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movies is not bad.. it just that there's too many plot holes and some questionable choices. Don't get me wrong I respect Rians choice\\, it's just that as a Star Wars movie it's really unsatisfying","true":true}
