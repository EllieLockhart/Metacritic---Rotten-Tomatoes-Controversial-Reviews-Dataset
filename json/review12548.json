Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe that so many fanboys ripped The Last Jedi apart. I'm glad I went to see it after viewing so many bad reviews. I went into the theater with very low expectations but was pleasantly surprised.  Practically all the negative comments that were made save one I disagreed with but that tiny observation was not enough to ruin the experience.  Don't believe what the fanboys are saying about The Last Jedi. These are people that take the Star Wars franchise WAY too personal. ITS JUST A MOVIE! And it's fantastic! Trust me\\, nearly every bad comment made about this movie was either wrong or out of context. For instance the \\\"The lightsaber toss behind the back\\\" rage. It wasn't Luke's!! It was Anikan's!! Anyway I loved the 8th installment of this beloved saga.","true":true}
