Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where to begin? The Last Jedi makes a valiant effort to break the mould\\, to be different\\, to be a fresh\\, original instalment in Disney's trilogy. In that respect\\, Rian Johnson's Star Wars debut is an undeniable success. The film has dazzling special effects\\, the action sequences are fantastic and the relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren is tantalising. However\\, in every other respect\\, The Last Jedi fails miserably. Johnson spends its entire running time trying earnestly to butcher the much loved Luke Skywalker\\, he breaks decades old Star Wars lore and it won't surprise me if the film becomes antonymous with fan service. Overall\\, a brave effort but JJ Abrams has been left with a Herculean task to try and rescue the trilogy. You should see it\\, but rewatching may send you round the bend.","true":true}
