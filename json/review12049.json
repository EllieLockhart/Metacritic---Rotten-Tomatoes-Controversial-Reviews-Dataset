Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually feel sorry for the people who gave this only 1\/2 star ... these fans got so caught up in the expectation of where the plot should go for them\\, that they couldn't just sit back and enjoy where the plot DID take them... I'm giving this movie 4+ stars !  Were there hokie scenes ?? yes ... One of the worst cheesiest scenes ever in any SW movie (Leia Poppins )... but Rey & Kylo fighting together was freakin' awesome... yes\\, I'm disappointed that this movie didn't go where I wanted it to go.. I wanted Rey's lineage to be Skywalker very badly\\, but she still comes through with a great performance .. IF YOU ARE A REY FAN\\, THEN YOU WILL LIKE THIS MOVE. PERIOD. It's clear that this movie is wiping the slate clean of the \\\"old guard\\\" and bringing in the new .. this may be why the audience is so disappointed... but it was still fun\\, action-packed\\, funny at times (yes.. corny at times too)\\, with great visual effects & unexpected plot twists..... I will definitely go see again! .... Lastly\\, here are my rankings for all of the SW movies: ESB>ANH>TFA>TLJ>ROTJ>R1>ROTS>TPM>AOTC... the only thing I'm not sure of is if I like TLJ better than TFA... still debating that.. need to see again!","true":true}
