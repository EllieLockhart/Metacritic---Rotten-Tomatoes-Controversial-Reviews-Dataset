We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Whether you like this game or not is going to be completely subjective. Youre going to have to play it for yourself and see how it hits you. For me\\, it got me to feel so many things. I really thought I was going to hate the game. SPOILERS When you get to play as Abby\\, the game feels unbearably long\\, because of the tension in the theater you just left. All I could think of was getting back there to figure out what the hell happens. Plus you hate Abby.  When they tried to get me to feel for her i wasnt biting. I did not care about her\\, or her past\\, or her relationships. She killed Joel. But I thank God they did draw it out\\, because that gave me the time I needed to humanize and forgive Abby. They got me so late in Abby's story. When I saw what she went through to help those Scars\\, I didnt see a villian anymore. I saw an actual person with a good heart. When her friend scolds her and tells her shes not a good person and Abby breaks down because she can't seem to forgive herself either. She wasnt happy with what she did but I think she was looking for peace just like Ellie was trying to do when she went back for Abby. The game made me go from this completely one-sided blind hatred\\, to compassion and wanting nothing but the best for her. I WRESTLED WITH MYSELF pushing the attack buttons on the final scene. That was unlike anything I have ever experienced\\, and though the pacing mightve been screwy to some\\, I could not imagine any other way to do it. The way it moved me up and down gets a Fat 10 outta 10. Gameplay super intense and fun too but I just wanted to talk about the story lol.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
