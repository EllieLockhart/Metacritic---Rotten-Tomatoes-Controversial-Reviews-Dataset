The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The ultimate scene that kicks off the events of the entire game relies on completely retconning Joel and Tommy's characters. Throughout the first game\\, you see these two always being wary of any stranger. Joel even went as far as to attempt to run over a dude with a car because he knew that guy was faking his injury.\r\rNeil Druckmann comes along and goes\\, \\\"Nope\\, let's just throw the entire canon away\\\". He had Joel and Tommy suddenly do a complete 180 on their established characters. They tell a complete group of strangers where their hideout was and Joel told them his real name AFTER THE STRANGERS LOCKED THE DOOR IN THE CABIN.\r\rWhat's worse\\, is the game pathetically tries to get you to sympathize with the character who killed Joel. That attempt fell completely flat when we find out what motivated her to hunt him down: Joel killed the doctor\\, Abby's dad\\, who was about to do life-ending surgery on Ellie\\, who was shown to be an incompetent piece of garbage in the first game. That's right\\, the game wants you to feel sorry for Abby because her piece of s**t dad was killed for attempting to end Ellie's life without her consent.\r\rGameplay is only marginally better than the story. It works\\, but it's nothing special. The sequel doesn't do much to evolve the mechanics from the 1st game. But if you want to do that\\, then you need to engage the player in other ways. Well\\, the game already failed with the story. How about enemy variety and behavior? Sad to say\\, the enemy AI is very questionable. You could be in their near direct vision and they would still not notice you. You could kill someone with an arrow and his\/her companion would not have heard the sound.\r\rThe problem is the pacing and spacing out of the gameplay loop. The first game did a good job spacing out the 'sneak around\\, gather supplies\\, kill enemies' phases with puzzles. The sequel throws out the puzzles entirely. As a result\\, you're left to wash\\, rinse\\, and repeat again and again and again for hours.\r\rOverall\\, the story is a 0\/10 for completely failing barely 2 hours in. I'm sorry\\, but if you have to rely on retcons to jumpstart the plot\\, then that disqualifies the entire story. It's like how I don't need to read an entire essay if the thesis is completely garbage. The gameplay\\, at least\\, is serviceable\\, so that's why I'm giving the game a 2\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
