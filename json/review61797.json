Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I\u2019m sorry\\, what?! Am I even playing the same game?! How has this gotten such glowing reviews from so many gaming outlets? I\u2019m going to go into why this makes no sense:First\\, this is coming from a place of someone who has the original game in my top three best of all time. I came into this from a place very forgiving of mistakes because I wanted so bad to see more of this world. What I got instead is such a dumpster fire of plot holes and bad writing that I cannot get past that.They basically took the best parts of the first and these characters we loved and mashed them into the ground (yes intentional wording). For the sake of being edgy and trying to subvert expectations. The other thing is maddening is how hard they try virtue signaling. I am all about more representation in video games\\, but this is so hamfisted it goes to only serves to make the lgbtq community look worse in my opinion.What this plays out to be is a long winded\\, poorly written\\, angsty revenge plot with semi-servicable gameplay. Also are we seriously going to end the game with a QuickTime event? Don\u2019t even get me started on how horrid the ending is and how hypocritical and against the character\u2019s ingrained themes and motives it was on a writing level\\, but seriously?The only reason I gave this at least a 2 is because the gameplay is serviceable ( it doesn\u2019t really do much different from the original game) and because the world crafting and art design is extremely masterfully done. This is easily one of the most gorgeous games to look at I have ever played.In conclusion\\, I feel extremely sorry for those who worked on this game to have people come in and completely tarnish what they poured their hearts and souls into the art assets and set pieces with horrible writing. Sony\\, you would be wise to do some cleaning out of naughty dog in its current iteration or I do not see things going well in the future. I have lost all trust in the current decision making at the studio level.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
