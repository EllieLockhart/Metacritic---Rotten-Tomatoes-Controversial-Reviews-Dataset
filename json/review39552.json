Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was fantastic!  I loved how unpredictable it was and how Rian handled this franchise.  I especially enjoyed the fact that he went against the Fan Fiction \\\"Canon\\\" and carried the mantle on with LucasFilm.  Those complaining about it not sticking to canon are simply frustrated that they wasted their time reading something that was merely written by fans and had nothing to do with LucasFilm.  Overall\\, it was shot wonderfully and was a perfect balance between the old and new.","true":true}
