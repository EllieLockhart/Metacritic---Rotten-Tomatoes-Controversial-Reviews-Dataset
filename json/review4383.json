Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can we please remake this movie? All of the pieces are there for potential greatness. Instead\\, this movie is full of emptiness and turns out to be a huge let down. Could have explained how Rey is so awesome at learning Mind Trick\\, and could have made Finn a Force-user. Cringy humour\\, poor plot (one big chase scene)\\, poor character development (Finn went from First Order deserter\\, to hero-in-the-making\\, last film. This film. back to deserter\\, to useless\\, to suicidal\\, to useless)\\, and betrayed the character of Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
