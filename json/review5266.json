Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Definitely #9 in order of best to worst. The story was choppy\\, the interaction between Luke and Rey was probably what I like least about the film.  The story line seem to mirror the first Star Wars movie: A New Hope. 1) Luke found Obi Wan also distancing himself from the rebellion and the force. Ren finds Luke -- same story.  2) Luke is distraught about his former pupil going astray.  Obi Wan was torn about Darth Vader.  See where I'm going with this?  Don't get me started on Princess Leia ... Episode 9 is where we see her using The Force???!!!  This seems like an opportunity for a subplot here 8 episodes ago when we learned that she and Luke where siblings.  There were so many resurrections here that Jesus might be feeling like his thunder was stolen: Leia\\, Rose\\, and Captain Phasma (who was about to give the beheading order when the whole place blew apart but appeared without a scratch).  They at least should have saved General Akbar too.  Need a better editor for sure next time.","true":true}
