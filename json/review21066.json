Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was saddened by this movie. They took one of my favorite characters from my childhood and made him into something unrecognizable. It seemed they never saw the original movies. They seemed more interested in making a statement than making a cohesive and thrilling movie. \\n\\nJar Jar was better than what they called Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
