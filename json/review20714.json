Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I walked into the theater feeling like a little kid again and walked out feeling like i got punched in the gut and heartbroken. (spoilers ahead) I had bad feeling the minute  Luke threw the light saber over his shoulder after Rey handed it to him. What they did to Luke's character in this movie is a travesty. I think 99.9% of star wars fans were excited to see Luke in action again wielding his found light saber and using the force. What an epic let down. TFA was a flawed movie but it had respect for the old characters and the universe George Lucas created. It also set up this movie to be epically awesome and answer a lot of questions from TFA\\, but it fails. I understand that this is about a new generation and new characters for the Star Wars universe but this new trilogy should have SLOWLY and RESPECTFULLY transitioned from the old to the new. TFA Did this for han solo\\, he was awesome and one of the best parts of that movie.  I could go on and on but in the end this movie is the worst in the franchise. Period.","true":true}
