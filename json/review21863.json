Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just like 'The Force Awakens'\\, 'The Last Jedi\\\" is a visual feast! Filled with amazing effects\\, battles and creatures (aliens). I found it somewhat predictable\\, but it just didn't matter. The Last Jedi was a fantastic instalment\\, and just leaves you ready for more! Bring on part 9. May the force be with you.","true":true}
