Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Out of place humor\\, characters thrown away. Luke's story is terrible. Its unfortunate the direction preferred fresh to the point of destroying the image of the fans hero and killing him off so they could set the stage for their new heroes. It could have been handled so much better. Better bridges could have been built and honestly they could have given Luke a better legacy. This trilogy is over for me\\, pre-Disney EU will be my canon. These stories aren't the stuff I'm going to wait in line for and pay good money to see.","true":true}
