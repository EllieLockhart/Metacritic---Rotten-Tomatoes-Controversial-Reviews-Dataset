Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spolier Alert!!\\nHow they killed off Hans in the last movie\\, disgraceful.. how they killed off Luke\\, even worse. No epic final fight even to send Luke off with a bang??? Leya flying like superman? Wtf.. only 1 light saber fight in a star wars film??? Feminist agenda pushed here? Fins weird side story line with the Asian girl?? Wtf\\n\\nSeriously the worst star wars film I have seen. The first in this terrible trilogy to be was better.","true":true}
