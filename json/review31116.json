Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Solid movie. Kind of slow at the beginning. I have say\\, however\\, the negative backlash from the vocal minority is ridiculous. I truly don\u2019t get why this group is up in arms. These are the same people that said The force awakens was a shot for shot remake. Now the last Jedi was too different. Come on people. To compare to the prequels and rate this movie far lower just proves your illegitimate review. May the force be with you! ","true":true}
