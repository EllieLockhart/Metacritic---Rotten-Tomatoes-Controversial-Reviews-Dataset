Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a horribly written film. Terrible editing. Zero character arcs. Plot holes\\n you can drive a truck through. And this is just on its merits\\, or lack there of\\, as a film. Now let's address its place in the Star Wars cannon. \\n\\nThere is nothing resembling the spirit and myth is of the first six films in the most popular franchise in all of film history. Most especially the original trilogy. The social commentary throughout the film took priority over any semblance of character development. The tragedy is that there is no way to welcome this film into the series. It destroyed anything Abrams set up in ep 7. And it had an obligation to the series that Johnson just flippantly disregards. \\n\\nThere is no way I will ever see this movie again. I would recommend to anyone that they save their money. Do not support this trash. It's an insult to everything that came before it. And it's a shame.","true":true}
