Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it could have been barely decent as a standalone movie (the tone is still all over the place\\, the humor is cringy\\, the pacing is not very engaging andwhatthefuckleilainspace) as part of the saga is so absurdly out of place that it is laughable. It is not a \\\"political issue\\\" about feminism or shit\\, this feels like the most costly fanfiction ever made and it is not \\\"deep\\\" or \\\"revolutionary\\\" in its narrative as some reviewer would make you believe. Killing every plotline and destroying half the characters in dumb scenes is not defying expectations\\, it's just disgraceful writing. The worst thing of all is that in every scene the galaxy seems to be shrinking\\, to the point that a rich setting like that of star wars by the end feels completely empty and reduced to a bunch of key players. We can only hope for a better sequel but frankly by this point I lack the joy and curiosity to see how this thing will go.","true":true}
