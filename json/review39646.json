Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a 2hr30min film that should have just been 1hr45mins. Scenes were forced and underwhelming. Some characters did not made sense. A lot of good opportunities were not taken. Rogue One is way better than this episode. Episode 8 feels like a filler\\, similar to what an anime series would do.","true":true}
