Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm giving this very strong three stars because it was a good movie but not nearly as great as the Force Awakens.  I don't understand why so many people are negating the Force Awakens.  It brought back Start Wars in a way that George Lucas could never do.  I grew up watching the first original trilogy.  The prequels were difficult to stomach.  I think that Last Jedi is nowhere near as bad as the prequels.  I just didn't like the scene where Leia used the force in space.  That scene was crap.  The Yoda was scene was cool but Yoda looked odd.  The entire Rose and Fin scene was terrible.  I did like the beginning of the movie and fight sequences.  Overall not the greatest movie but it was okay.  I'm not sure if I'll buy it.","true":true}
