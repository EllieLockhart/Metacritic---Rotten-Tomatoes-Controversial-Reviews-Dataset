Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is a great movie.  Looking forward to the next movie to continue the story.  Glad to see that they are growing the story and taking it different directions.  Force Awakens was fun but to similar to past movies.","true":true}
