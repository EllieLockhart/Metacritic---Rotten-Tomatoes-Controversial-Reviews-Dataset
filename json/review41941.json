Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie\\, just like the previous\\, is just a rehashing of the original trilogy. Could they have made this any less original? Probably not. These movies make the Prequels look like masterpieces. At least the prequels were original and presented us with original characters\\, planets\\, etc.","true":true}
