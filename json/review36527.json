Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie experience is actually good! Nice effects and beautiful imagery... however it is a very bad Star Wars movie and therefor I only give it 1 star. I went to the cinema with a lot of expectations (because it is a Star Wars movie) and was let down and really disappointed. Even though I like the fact that Rian Johnson tries to subvert our expectations\\, i think I would have liked one of the many theories more than I actually liked what he made.","true":true}
