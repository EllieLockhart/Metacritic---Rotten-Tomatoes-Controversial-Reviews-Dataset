Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ewwww\\, this movie was cringey.  I cannot believe I'm saying this\\, but I was actually bored watching it.  My 9-year-old son actually asked \\\"when will this be over\\\" at about the halfway point.  We usually sit glued to the screen during a Star Wars movie...this one\\, couldn't wait for it to be over!","true":true}
