Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Star Wars franchise is the pinnacle of movie making for me. This movie took a dump all over it and set it on fire. There isn't enough room in a review for me to state the reasons for my grievances. It will not get a second viewing from me\\, nor will I be adding it to my film collection. What an insulting experience for a life long fan.","true":true}
