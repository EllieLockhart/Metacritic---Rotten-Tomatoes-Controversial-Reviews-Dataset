Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film worked\\, with a believable plot line and snarky dialog and slapstick moments that harken back to the original trilogy. This film happens in the nuance\\, with complicated problems\\, soulful characters\\, kid-friendly peripherals\\, and that classic Star Wars intercutting between different plot lines (often juxtaposed to emphasize their stark contrasts with one another and establish a mid-story rhythm). Oh yes\\, and John Williams is back with a phenomenal\\, perfectly pronounced score\\, replete with a bounty of old cues that blend seamlessly back and forth\\, dancing between old and new.","true":true}
