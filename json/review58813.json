The story. Everything else is excellent. The voice acting\\, the graphics\\, just the over all execution of the technical side is pretty great. I am a big fan of the first game\\, and i liked the simplicity of the crafting. The stealth left some to be desired but I never looked at it as a straight stealth game.\r\rThe story is.. Its just ham handed in how they try to get you to care even an ounce about the characters from the outside perspective. These characters literally come into your home in the beginning and bludgeon you're beloved character to death. While i sincerely believe their reasons why they did it\\, as a fan of the first game and the main characters I simply wanted one thing and that was to kill those people (in game duh). I wanted nothing to do with them but for them to suffer and be scared I was coming for them. This is not what we got. We play as them and the game gives us all these nice and caring perspectives and all the reason why they think we should like the character Abbey but really. I couldn't care less about her and her journey. I wanted nothing to do with her or her friends. I loathed the entirety of her side of the game play. I do not know what drove the writers\/creators to go this route but I just can't wrap my head around why they did it. Why did they think this was a good move?\u2026 Expand","true":true}
