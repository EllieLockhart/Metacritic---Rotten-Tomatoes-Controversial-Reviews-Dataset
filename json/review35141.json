Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens was a safe movie that didn't take risks but this can't be said about The Last Jedi. For surprising me\\, at every turn (which is a rarity)\\, this film gets all the plaudits from me. \\n\\nIf I was being super critical\\, I didn't like the slowest space chase in history and the pointless casino bit. They added to the pacing issues which clearly ballooned the run time. \\n\\nI went in excited and still came out excited so for that\\, I love it.","true":true}
