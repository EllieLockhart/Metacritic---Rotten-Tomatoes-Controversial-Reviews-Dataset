My biggest gripe with the game won't really affect the majority of the player base\\, but it's connected to completing the game (100%). It can get a bit annoying when trying to complete the gambling aspect of the mini games\\, which can get a bit annoying because of the randomness but then again it's realistic so it doesn't bother me a whole lot.\rTL;DR fun game with good story\\, interesting combat and a bunch of fun side activities.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
