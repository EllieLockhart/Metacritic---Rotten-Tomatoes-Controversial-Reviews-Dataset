Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie! There were so many surprises in it\\, so much going on in it\\, that I am going to need to see it multiple times. It is a rich script\\, with fantastic acting. Adam Driver continues to amaze me with his superb acting: he manages to show how Kylo Ren is just about ready to cross the line into crazy town\\, completely unstable\\, his anger is just about uncontrollable. And yet I can fully see the internal conflict he's having too. Brilliant.\\n\\nI am a fan of all these movies. I was a young boy when Return of the Jedi came out in theaters. I have been a Star Wars fan my whole life. These films are great\\, and I can't wait to see what JJ Abrams does next\\, and I can't wait to see what Rian Johnson does next.","true":true}
