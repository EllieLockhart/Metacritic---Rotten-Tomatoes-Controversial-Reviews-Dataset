Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars trilogy\\, at least from 1 to 7\\, are about the Skywalker family. The Last Jedi is something that did not make sense from the story plot point of view.\\nI agree that it is one of the best graphic effects Star Wars movie\\, however i'm not looking just for that.\\n\\nIn the end\\, this movie had no story logic.","true":true}
