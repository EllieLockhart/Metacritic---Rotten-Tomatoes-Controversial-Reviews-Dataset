Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a horrible movie\\, but not a great one as well.\\n\\nFirst\\, a more aggressive editing could easily take that extra half an hour out and still keep all of the story lines.Second\\, talking about those story lines: outside of the main core story (Ren\/Skywalker\/Rey) the other stories felt mostly like fillers used to create some sense of urgency (the rebels are in danger)\\, and took out any depth that some of the characters had in the first movie (e.g. Fin).\\n\\nAdam Driver was great as Kylo Ren - you could really sense his conflict\\, and I'll admit that Rey was finally interesting\\, but overall\\, the movie was a little underwhelming.","true":true}
