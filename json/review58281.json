Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely brilliant. Many of the concerns that I've read from those who don't like the movie concern nostalgia for what has come before this. So what if Luke Skywalker wasn't exactly who you thought he would be\\, many of our heroes are falling right before our eyes in real life right now too. It happens\\, it's reality. TLJ was respectful in its efforts to honor the past\\, while clearly forging ahead with new characters and a different storyline. Folks complained that TFA was simply a remake of ANH. Now many of those same people are pissed that TLJ has strayed too far. If I remember correctly\\, many viewers in a time long ago and far away\\, weren't thrilled with The Empire Strikes Back either\\, because how it dark it was and how it left their heroes in  such peril. And that turned out to be one of the best of the franchise. Here's hoping the haters relax a bit and the same future holds for TLJ.","true":true}
