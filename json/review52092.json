Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing The Force Awakens I went in to The Last Jedi with as little expectations as possible and lucky that I did\\, the movie started good but dragged throughout.  The entire mid portion of the movie was basically unnecessary and added no value to the story line\\, the first 30 minutes and the last 30 minutes was the entire movie.  The movie just felt really dumbed down.  I could go on and on about how clueless they make the First Order smh\\, also on a side note when are we going to get a good lightsaber battle please.  Overall it was somewhat entertaining and a good film to look at visually but that didn't make up for the weak plot\\, story line\\, and lack of really good action sequences.  Oh and I forgot to say the entire movie was pretty darn cheesy!","true":true}
