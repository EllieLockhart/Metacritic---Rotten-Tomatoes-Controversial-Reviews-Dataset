Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The completely fake 5-star reviews that appeared all of a sudden only confirm that Rian Johnson is a sore loser.\\nHe conceived the fake Twitter harassment of Kelly Marie Tran and probably convinced (or coerced) her into participating to this abominous hoax\\, and now he is paying lots of people (probably child slaves) for flooding this site with fake positive reviews.\\nShame on you\\, Rian. You really have a typical inferiority complex. Get a life and stop making movies. You are not good at it.","true":true}
