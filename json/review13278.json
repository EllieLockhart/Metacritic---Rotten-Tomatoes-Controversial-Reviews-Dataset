Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't understand why this movie is getting all the hate that I'm hearing about. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course\\, but honestly I loved this film because it added so many new ideas to the franchise that we haven't seen before. By that\\, I mean the plot was actually unique compared to the last movie (that's not to say that the last one wasn't good). In short\\, I'm just amazed that people aren't interested in good storytelling (which is what this film has got a lot of)\\, and instead just action scenes. Star Wars: The Last Jedi was an amazing film with only a few things I wasn't fond of. I would definitely recommend this movie regardless of the bad rep it's receiving.","true":true}
