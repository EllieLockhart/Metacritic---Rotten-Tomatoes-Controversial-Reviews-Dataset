Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't understand the hate from the audience. This was pretty much exactly what I expected and was hoping for. Felt like Star Wars yet did new things. Best acting yet in a star wars film top to bottom. Kept the mythology intact while adding new elements to it that keep in line with already established cannon. Bonus points for Laura Dern. Easily up there for me personally with Empire and New Hope.","true":true}
