Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible! Trying to figure out how to give zero stars. The movie was disconnected mush - painfully lurching between consumer product placement and future theme park rides. A few sad motivational speeches mixed in. Plot\\, etc\\, if any\\, was laughable. The cinematography was often beautiful\\, but the end result was garbage: as ridiculous as Space Balls -- just not as funny. I feel bad for all the artists\\, designers\\, etc who all must have worked hard on this. Anyway\\, I'm not an obsessive Star Wars fan\\, but as a 41 yo\\, I grew up with these movies. I think this franchise is done for me. Very sad.","true":true}
