Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"'The Force Awakens' was better\\, but by no means perfect. 'The Last Jedi'\\, although a failure as a 'Star Wars' movie\\, also fails as an entertaining piece of cinema. I was bored for a large part of the movie. And too many characters were scene filling non-entities that didn't develop beyond what has already been established. Passable\\, only by the skin of its teeth.","true":true}
