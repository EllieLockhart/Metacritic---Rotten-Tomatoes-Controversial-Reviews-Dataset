Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love watching Mark finally being Luke again\\, after 30 years.....but his character was torn apart.\\nEver since the beginning of the movie\\, you can tell that the writers didn't care about the fans or even legacy his franchise has. Tossing away an heirloom like Anakin's lightsaber\\, disregarding EVERYTHING.....I mean\\, that's not Luke Skywalker\\, that's not Luke who went to save his father from the Emperor.....We all understand this is a new trilogy\\, there's new characters and all\\, new plots\\, new stories.....but you can't disregard the past that easily and stupidly like this movie has envisioned us to \\\"accept\\\" Luke.\\nAlso.....first Star Wars movie in which there's no saber duel.....like\\, really?......\\nI certainly hope Kathleen Kennedy is removed from everything related to Star Wars......there's no need for a great franchise like SW to get all political.","true":true}
