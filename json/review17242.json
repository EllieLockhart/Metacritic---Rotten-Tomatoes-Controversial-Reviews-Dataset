Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really\\, really enjoyed this on the first watching. Looking forward to a second viewing to catch things I might have missed. Yes\\, I'm a big Star Wars fan\\, but this movie was NOT fan service as much as The Force Awakens was - instead\\, this one stands on it's own. No\\, it's not perfect. But 56% audience score is bizarre... Maybe some people out there hold Star Wars to an almost unattainable standard?","true":true}
