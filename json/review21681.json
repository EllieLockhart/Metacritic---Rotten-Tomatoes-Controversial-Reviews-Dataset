Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just...a mess. Disney does not know what fans want or where to take the Star Wars films. A bad\\, pointless\\, disappointing movie that does not have a direction. In the mix however\\, are sparks of absolute brilliance thrown in occasially\\, which only makes you more disappointed with everything surrounding those moments","true":true}
