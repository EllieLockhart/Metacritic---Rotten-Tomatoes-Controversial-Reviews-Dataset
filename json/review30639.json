Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply put\\, sometimes things being straightforward is good. I felt like every moment in this movie was some sort of dumb twist\\, but dumb in the fact that it never changed anything. Oh look the bad guy is the good guy\\, just kidding theyre still the bad guy!! Not to mention all the extra fluff characters that didn't need to be introduced. None of the twists are surprising\\, and almost all of them are necessary. They even added bad twists to ruin good twists.\\n\\n99% of the drama was created just by the main characters screwing up\\, so when things get resolved\\, you don't feel like they accomplished anything.\\nThe only interesting character was Luke with Rey and Kylo kind of being okay.\\nBut they just destroy Lukes story with the horrible resolution.\\n\\nNot to mention that this movie hardly progresses the story in anyway. You could just go from the end of episode 7 directly to the end of episode 8\\, and the main characters are pretty much in the same position they started.\\n\\nGod. There were some really good moments in the movie to\\, but they were just eclipsed by how anticlimatic the story felt.","true":true}
