Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an RT profile for the first time specifically because of how awful this movie. It's laughably bad. Hollywood should stop allow people to write and direct their own movies. You wind up with this garbage. I at least hope the complete lack of any complexity to the writing and total lack of subtext was a choice so they could translate it into other languages easier. Seems like something Disney would do... sacrifice the integrity of Star Wars to make a quick buck. Thanks Disney.","true":true}
