Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie but it was hard to choose either 4.5 or 5. It was pretty long so I think i decided. I thought it was great it went for the comedy aspect again like in The Force Awakens. It took a good take when Rey was on the island with Luke. I also liked when they were  on the salt planet it was cool because they added in the sci-fi relief of different planets and how they all are unique.                                                                                                                    \\n\\n      The only thing that i did not like is how Leia came back to life from outer space by using the force because her actor had tragically died. So next movie she will have to die off. Unless they want to computerize her like they did to Krennic. And Finns character changed cause he used to be the scared one now hes risking his life for the rebel. But I am a huge StarWars fan so I had to give it a good rating. Overall I loved this movie and it well be a favorite of mine.","true":true}
