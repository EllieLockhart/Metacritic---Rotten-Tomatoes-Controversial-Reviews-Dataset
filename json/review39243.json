Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film felt so long. An easy 30 minutes could have been trimmed from this and made the story MOVE\\, you know\\, like a Star Wars movie. My biggest gripe is that this film had SO MANY missed opportunities in the story-telling. I will not see it again till it is free on TV. By the way\\, YES\\, I have been a faithful Star Wars fan since May 25th\\, 1977.","true":true}
