Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you ignore some horrible moments it was an overall good movie. I think they mishandled the rose and holdo roles in the movie. I get what they tried to do as a whole but definitely some cringeworthy lines were written for them that are off putting.","true":true}
