Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't really like the movie cause I feel it didn't make the Star Wars theme and also had one of the biggest let downs in movie history. I feel the movie was more of a comedy act then a true Star Wars movie. I was very disappointed after the movie because it in my opinion was just terrible. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the rest of my family seemed to love it","true":true}
