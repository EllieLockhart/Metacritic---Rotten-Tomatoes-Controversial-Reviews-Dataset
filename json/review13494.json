Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I fear that Rotten Tomatoes is receiving money from Disney for their movies rating. How is it possible that all this big movies related to Disney always have 85% or more. I really cannot believe it\\, this is the worst Star Wars film EVER and you have it at 90%\\, I dont know how. At leats we have the fans to put the real rating with the real rating of 50%.","true":true}
