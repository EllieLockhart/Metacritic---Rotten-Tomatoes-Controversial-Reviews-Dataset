Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing overall. Kylo-ok. Rey-ok. Leia- what the hell was that at the beginning? Luke- so much for the hero of the last 40 years- he's a whiny crybaby now. Finn- that was just an absolutely terrible story line. As a life long Star Wars fan I watched TFA and Rogue One several times in theaters and then bought the videos when they came out. This is more like the prequel trilogy- one and done. They are going to be awfully disappointed when the box office numbers start to plummet after the initial rush. Such a waste.","true":true}
