Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh god\\, what have they done to this series? It's like a star wars film made by someone that's never ever seen or heard of the original trilogy....\\nIts full of plot holes\\, such as finn waking from a coma and suddenly begin able to fly... To the utterly garbage way they treated luke in this film.... Who has apparently forgetting literally everything that happened to him in the first trilogy... I wanted my money back after this crap fest\\nWe have turbo laser blasts that \\\"fall\\\".. Because of space gravity apparently\\, a deus ex machina endings\\,... Leais Mary Poppins impression...
