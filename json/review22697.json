Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like so many\\, I have been a life long fan of the Star Wars franchise. I loved the original trilogy\\, I enjoyed the prequel trilogy (even though there were things I didn't like about it)\\, I liked Rogue One\\, and I also enjoyed The Force Awakens. Also like so many others\\, I would always like to see different angles in the film\\, for me it would be adding more of the former EU content. However\\, I was also really excited to be getting new Star Wars films to enjoy. When I saw the Last Jedi\\, I was disgusted. I am not going to go over the flaws of this film because others within this audience review's section have already expressed the problems with the film more eloquently than I can. But what I am going to say is this movie\\, and the direction of the franchise turned me\\, a life long fan of Star Wars\\, into someone who no longer wants anything to do with anything related to Star Wars again. Maybe this will change with time\\, but for now I can no longer stomach the current iteration of Star Wars that Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and Rian Johnson have served us.","true":true}
