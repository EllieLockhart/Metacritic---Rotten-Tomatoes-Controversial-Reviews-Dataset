Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to write up a huge\\, spoiler infested post combating all the negative hype. I would love to\\, but you know what? I'm enjoying the glow of a movie well enjoyed. \\nDoes it have plot holes? Yes. Though some plot holes that people have so vehemently complained about are explained either subtly or rather overtly in the last act.Does it suffer from tech blunders and tech flux? Oh yes. But what Star Wars movie hasn't? \\nWhat this movie has in spades is great storytelling\\, the wonder of the force\\, the struggle of light against dark\\, hope against hopelessness\\, rebellion against oppression. The character development is strong\\, and the big side quest that everyone complains about being pointless is great because it seems that way\\, and yet\\, in the very last frame\\, you see the point it had. The connection the force made. Not only that\\, the fact that the harebrained scheme DIDN'T work for once\\, is wonderful. \\nI went in expecting the worst because of the reviews\\, and came out baffled as to why people were so upset. This is the Star Wars of my childhood. And just like Force Awakens\\, I love it for it.","true":true}
