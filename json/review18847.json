Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a nice addition to my collection\\, with twists\\, humor\\, new characters\\, and very cool scenes. I am not sure the reason some fans didn't like it. They said TFA didn't take any risks and basically a remake of new hope\\, and now they say TLJ took to much risks by not doing same things. I think we are the only fandom that is ungrateful and looking to trash the new movies no matter how original or non original the movies.","true":true}
