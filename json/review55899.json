Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remake it\\, or strike it out from canon completely! I can't stand bad writing( i.e. Rey as a Mery Sue) as well as I can't stand blatant\\, blunt SJW\/feminist propaganda and the fact\\, that for producers that political message was more important\\, than telling a good story. Only what they care about is money\\, but not quality. Propaganda and resenitment over Trump election is more important for them\\, over universal message and respect of legacy. Message of TLJ\\, and TFA as well\\, by the way\\, was political\\, wrong\\, and makes those movies very soon outdated\\, propably. What they wanted is an empowering feminist fantasy\\, but since they lack of creativity\\, they hijacked broadly beloved franchise\\, destroying it as \\\"outdated relict of patriarchal dominance\\\" and\\, on its ruins\/corpse\/remains\\, build their propaganda piece! This is unacceptable!","true":true}
