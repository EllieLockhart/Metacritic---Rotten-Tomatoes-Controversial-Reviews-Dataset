Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Two years ago\\, The Force Awakens proved Star Wars franchise was not dead and there were a lot of stories to tell. Now\\, The Last Jedi surprises audiences by going against most of the geek theories and it feels fresh because of it! The last instalment of the Star Wars saga doesn't try to please its faithful fans: it is a movie with its own soul\\, heart and story and that's why it works so beautifully (unlike the last season of Game of Thrones TV series). \\nRian Johnson knows what he's doing here. From the action-packed scenes\\, to inspiring moments of bravery and emotionally nuanced performances\\, he was able to show the world this is a product of \\\"cinematic passion\\\". Surprising plot twists and a reflection about the balance between light and darkness\\, The Last Jedi is a fantastic sequel. Some might recall there are a few awkward moments like [SPOLER] a flying Leia Organa [END OF SPOILER]\\, but cinematic light is much stronger than cinematic darkness in this one. \\nHigh praise for Mark Hamill\\, who delivers the best performance of his career as a Luke Skywalker who lost all his hope\\, and to both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver\\, who get enough room to develop their characters and assume their leading woman and leading man status in this franchise - they're both light and darkness\\, good and evil\\, and their chemistry is strong. A note of praise for Boyega\\, since we don't have many black actors presented with such a commanding role in a big franchise. And\\, of course\\, a standing ovation for Carrie Fisher! \\nVisual effects are stellar and production design is fantastic - and both build a fantastic world that embrace audiences. But the major technical achievment here is the original score: amazing and award-worthy! \\nFan theories won't find love in The Last Jedi\\, but the lastest Star Wars movie will please most audiences and not-so-die-hard-fans easily. This movie has a purpose and a message: the force can be with everyone! The Star Wars saga lives!","true":true}
