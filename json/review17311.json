Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I Really wanted to love this. and when it comes to visuals i did. the visuals are amazing the best i have ever seen... But the ploat?? well what plot.. the whole film was just one long slow chase with a pointless sub plot (yes it really is pointless it contributes absolutely nothing to the plot at all not a thing. not even any character development for finn or the new character rose). as for luke... well was that luke? i don't think so the amount of disrespect shown to luke skywalker was horrifying. although mark hamil has since retracted his comments (probably at disney's insistance) he was completly right. what we see is not the luke skywalker we know maybe he was a twin of luke but not the real luke skywalker. asides bad plot and pointless sub plots the visuals are great but this really is the worst star wars film ever made (Yes even the bizzare christmas special was better)","true":true}
