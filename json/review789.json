Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An epic betrayal to all Star Wars fans. Unless you are under the age of 13 and have never seen any of the Stars Wars movies you should save yourself the heartache and avoid this movie at all costs. Seriously. I usually don\u2019t write movie reviews\\, and I\u2019m not a hardcore Star Wars purist (I loved ep VII and Rogue One and I thought the prequels weren\u2019t that bad)\\, but as a lifelong Star Wars fan I have to warn my fellow geeks. I repeat: This movie will destroy the Stars Wars franchise for you. ","true":true}
