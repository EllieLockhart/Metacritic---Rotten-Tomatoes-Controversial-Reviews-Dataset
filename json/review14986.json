Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just wanted to watch and enjoy a Star Wars movie. This wasn't one.\\n\\nIt simply feels too disconnected from what I have come enjoy about this franchise. I couldn't understand how this movie belonged to the same universe the previous movies\\, including The Force Awakens\\, built through the years.\\n\\nThere is no nostalgia attachment to this franchise for me\\, as I never watched the movies when I was a kid. To me\\, introducing new ideas in this movie is something that I can understand and appreciate; however\\, they fell short as every different sub-story within the movie felt disconnected from one another and didn't translate towards something bigger.\\n\\nI don't mind the forced humor or if some aspects of the movie are not explained\\, as they are not important to the current events happening within the story. But the lack of character progression\\, the abandonment of story-lines from the previous movie\\, the incoherent story and overall the unnecessary story-lines created in this film made it difficult to enjoy for me.","true":true}
