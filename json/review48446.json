Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without spoilers.  Lazy writing\\, uninteresting characters\\, exponential plot holes\\, non-menacing Sith.  More Mary Sue'ing.  The #1 thing that spoiled the movie for me is the over-politicization of the film.  There were a couple of good scenes\\, which is why this even a 2 star (would be 1\/5 otherwise).   So many missed opportunities for greatness or at least coherence in this film.  Jar Jar would be a welcome change of pace.","true":true}
