Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing in so many ways. I really wanted to like this movie and was looking forward to it greatly\\, but left the cinema scratching my head as to what I had just seen. Snoke killed off in such a lame manner\\, Leia flying through space\\, Luke's character butchered\\, so many plot holes\\, weak and forced humour\\, the casino planet scenes seemed pointless\\, a space cruiser running out of fuel???? I could go on and on. JJ Abrams has a huge job in rescuing things for Episode 9\\, bring in the Knights of Ren\\, bring back Luke\\, do something to rescue the situation please. All that was set up with TFA was thrown out of the window for no apparent reason\\, badly written and boring for long stretches\\, something I never thought I would say about a Star Wars movie.
