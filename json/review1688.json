Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an avid Star Wars fan\\, I want to love every movie that is released. If this movie had given a good explanation about Snoke\\, an actually good answer to Rey's parentage\\, not made Leia look super dumb\\, gave a moment of silence for Ackbar's death\\, and made Luke's death powerful and meaningful\\, and removed their Social Justice Warrior agenda\\, then the movie would be very satisfactory. Hopefully J.J. can help build back up this mess that Disney and Kathleen Kennedy gave us. Filth that they are.","true":true}
