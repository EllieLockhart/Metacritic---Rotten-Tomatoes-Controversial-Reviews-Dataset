Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is movie is Star Wars lol I still\\nLove it. But out of all the Star Wars movies this one is..lacking in....idk. There is just directions with certain characters that just are dumb. I don't hate it. I just hope for redemption in the seq","true":true}
