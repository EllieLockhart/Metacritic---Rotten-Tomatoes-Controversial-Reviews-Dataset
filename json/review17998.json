Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think that this is one of the best films of the whole movie. Although the film has moments where it becomes weaker\\, BUT it can be forgiven if you consider the film as a whole. A smart movie!","true":true}
