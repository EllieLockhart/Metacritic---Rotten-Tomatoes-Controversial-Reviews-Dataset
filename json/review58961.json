We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"\u201cThe last of us part I\u201d is only considered a powerful story because it\u2019s bold ending. The story without it is simple\\, linear and I it is quite standard. Of course it has good pace and amazing performances from all the cast\\, but it\u2019s filed with a very old Hollywood cliche: \u201ctraumatized grumpy middle age man gets soft after is forced to deal with a teenage rebel\u201d. The game world is vast in possibilites and Part II takes advantage of them\\, filling the not so linear story with a interesting background: the Seraphites reminds me of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d world where religion is used as a pillar stone to manipulate and control people in a world of crisis. The WLF plot line demonstrates how a prominent society can be subdued to a twisted leader. But this informations of the world can only be enjoyed as long as you explore every corner of the game. And I was thrilled when the story took us to the Seraphite Island.Since I despised Joel\u2019s decision to lie in the ending of the first game\\, his fate in Part II is not revolting to my eyes\\, and it reminded me of choice\/consequence like Robb Stark and The Red Wedding. Where a choice based on a noble sentiment such as love\\, can cause damage to others as a whole.Ellie felt way more interesting as a character in Part I than Joel; and her shift in personality in Part II is believable after all the trauma and lies she suffered through all her life. Abby\u2019s storyline is well constructed when dealing on the consequences after Joel\u2019s murder and her motivations runs in opposite direction as Ellie\u2019s\\, until of course the point she is forced to review it.In the end\\, when both Ellie and Abby decide not to kill each other (yes\\, Abby could easily attack Ellie from behind while she was crying) we understand the unbalanced weight of vengeance versus forgiveness\\, and the incredible loss faced by both of them while  choosing to learn this balance it in the most brutal way.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
