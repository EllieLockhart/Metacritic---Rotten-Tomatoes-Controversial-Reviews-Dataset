Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very entertaining and good effects if it was just a Sci-fi film\\, but it had the Star Wars label on it. In my view Disney screwed up massively by allowing J. J. Abrams anywhere near Star Wars after what he did to Trek. The Force Awakens\\, likewise entertaining had if not pretended to be a real Star Wars film\\, screwed up the legacy of the original films and characters. This does likewise and finishes it off. Rian Johnson could have clearly done a better job than Abrams if he had been there from the start and been given much stricter perameters such as: Luke must be an incredibly powerful Jedi at this point so don't just write him off pointlessly. \\n\\nRogue One on the other hand fitted in beautifully.\\n\\nI think the only way to reconcile the Disney Saga films is to simply consider them Non-Canon and forget about them.","true":true}
