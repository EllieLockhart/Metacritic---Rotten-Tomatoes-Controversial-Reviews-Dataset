Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was better than I walked in expecting it's not as good as some of the original trilogy but better than most of the prequels and besides a few cheesy moments like in episode VII and a few badly written moments in the script it's a solid Star Wars that brings the cast around from the most part and has much better battle scenes while doing so. The movie creeps along for a while in the beginning to middle of the film but finishes with a bang. So we're there flaws? Yes but not as many as Episode I II and VII","true":true}
