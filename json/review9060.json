Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Full of badly timed cringey comedy\\, obvious toy-selling CGI things. Lots of weird moments and a running time that's at least 30 minutes too long. A plot that somewhat interestingly subverts every expectation to the sequel\\, but is full of holes and leads nowhere interesting\\, while at the same time almost standing still while the movie  is running.\\n\\nNot really recommended\\, but Star Wars fanatics will say this is great and critics have obviosuly been bought out by Disney. \\n\\nAnd no\\, I don't think that Star Wars should be all serious and that the good old movies are the best thing ever. This movie just doesn't pull off comedy as anything but a complete deflation of any scene that might have had emotional impact.","true":true}
