Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not the Star Wars movie you're looking for.  I bought tickets in advance\\, waited in line with my kids to get good seats\\, and felt joy seeing the title sequence and fan fare fill the theater.\\n\\nWhat I ended up watching proved to be at best\\, a missed opportunity to leverage the incredible cast Abram's put together in The Force Awakens\\, and at worst a giant mess of a story.\\n\\nFirst off the humor.  Sci Fi an humor go great together.  You can see what Guardian's of the Galaxy has done\\, and what the Orville is attempting.  This movie felt like Disney pushed Johnson to make the movie more like Guardians.  Which isn't necessary\\, and actually feels wedged in.\\n\\nThe actual story structure is bizarre\\, as it bounces about having the heroes dance around in pointless efforts.  Whether it's Poe leading a mutiny against a Vice Admiral\\, when all she needed to do was fill him in on her plan (given the decimated ranks of Rebel leadership\\, it was the least she could do)\\, or Finn running off to Canto Bight for no damn reason.\\n\\nugh...sorry.  It's just a mess.  Some people love it\\, I'm glad.  But let's be honest\\, this move would be a joke if it wasn't for the Star Wars halo surrounding it.\\n\\nPeople WANT to love it\\, so they ignore the bad writing\\, and poor story plotting.\\n\\nI recommend waiting to see this at home.  It's a long and dull movie.  \\n\\nsigh","true":true}
