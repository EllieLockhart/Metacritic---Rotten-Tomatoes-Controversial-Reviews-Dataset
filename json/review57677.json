Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly a disaster of a movie. Not only did it completely disregard any and all plot threads left open from The Force Awakens\\, it managed to close all of the ones leading into Ep IX which has left nothing for the sequel to go off. The movie fundamentally did not understand the character of Luke Skywalker and destroyed his legacy\\, along with the legacy of our Original Trilogy heroes. Poor writing\\, out of place comedy\\, and a lack of understanding of the core fanbase\/franchise have culminated in this disaster of a film. Not only has Disney killed any and all interest I had in this trilogy\\, it has killed my love for the franchise. I have been a lifelong fan of Star Wars and some of my favourite characters include Princess Leia\\, Ahsoksa Tano\\, and from the EU\\, Mara Jade\\, Aurra Sing\\, and Jaina Solo. I don't like this trilogy because Rey is the main character\\, I hate it because it doesn't fit into the Skywalker saga.\\n\\nShame on you for tanking this franchise. I refuse to ever give anymore money to Disney.","true":true}
