Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot understand for the life of me there aren't more critics calling out this terrible movie. How can they all ignore the gaping plot holes\\, the unlikable and unnecessary characters\\, pointless side plots\\, and the lazy and pedantic storytelling? It is such a shame because there are a couple of actual good moments in this movie that are completely overshadowed by the rest of this mess.","true":true}
