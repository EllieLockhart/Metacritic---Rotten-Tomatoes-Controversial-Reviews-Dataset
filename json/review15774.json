Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love EVERYTHING Star Wars. That said.....\\, I am super disappointed this script\/story board was approved. It really felt like a 2.5 hour slow chase. The main antagonists were reduced to punch lines of \\\"p'unk'd\\\" jokes. I get the need for a few cheeky laughs\\, but it felt like the cheesy giggle spots were more thought out than the main plot direction. \\nPlease....don't get me wrong....if you enjoyed TLJ\\, I'm happy for you! I WISH I liked it! I just felt let down by the writing and script. There were some amazing moments\\, and visuals...but I just couldn't stop asking ?'s about some big plot points. Biggest disappointment\\, the total degradation or serious weight to the \\\"bad guys\\\". They all feel like a cheesy punch line now. Wasted Snoke....WASTED PHASMA!! \\nBummer!","true":true}
