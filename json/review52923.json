Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incredibly well thought out movie\\, The Last Jedi attempts to pave the way for episode 9 as a huge game changer. With various plots taking place over what seems to be the course of a day\\, the movie brings some much needed analyzing to the Star Wars universe\\, such as the teachings of the Jedi\\, and reckless Heroism. With characters being placed in such tense and unknown situations\\, it would be easy for some to consider the reactions of older characters of the series \\\"out of character\\,\\\" but the story instead chooses to play with concepts left ambiguous in the original\\, flushing them out. The movie utilizes morality and uncertainty well\\, a great watch for fans or casual movie goers.\\n\\n*Spoilers from this Point*\\nSome scenes\/concepts of the movie were a bit out of place\\, dropping bombs in space seemed a bit silly\\, and seeing a certain someone enter the vacuum of space only to survive via the force seemed odd to me at first - but given a moment of thought\\, the character developing such strong force powers felt like a nice change to me. Characters with such force powers have existed in the expanded Star Wars canon\\, but now it seems such powers are completely canon; meaning that this character is possibly one of the strongest force users in existence. There are more scenes that sort of bend the canon of star wars in the move as it goes along\\, such as Luke's insistence on balance between light and dark powers\\, instead of straying only within the light\\, a change not only fits Luke's character\\, but backs his reasoning against the Jedi way.","true":true}
