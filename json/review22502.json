Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me begin by stating that I've been a Star Wars fan since I received the VHS set when I was 6 in 1992. All through Middle School and High school I lived and breathed Star Wars. In fact\\, while in the drum line in High School\\, our out of town trips turned into \\\"Wes vs the entire Drum Line at Star Wars Trivial Pursuit\\\". I had every color and style of Lightsaber and read anything I could get my hands on that instructed me in the ways of the VII forms of Lightsaber Combat. Bottom Line\\, I love Star Wars.\\nI feel that the setup for The Last Jedi was a unique concoction of the perfect storm. Never be never before in the grand history of storytelling had we been given a two year gap between stories with the added venue of the online community. The force Awakens was different in that we had no idea where the saga was going to take us. But with The Last Jedi\\, the set up made all the difference. Don't hear me wrong\\, when I say that the community was the real issue with my un-enjoyment of the movie\\, because there were some pretty obvious issues with the movie on it's own. Did 2 years of theorizing and philosophizing set the movie up for failure in my book? Probably. But truly at it's core\\, my main issue with this movie is this:\\nIt assumed too many things.\\nWhen the First Order emerges out of Hyperspace above the Resistance Base and deliberately opts to fire upon the base.......and THEN moves to destroy the fleet.\\nQuestion: If the base is stuck on the planet\\, and the fleet stands a chance of escaping\\, why fire on the base first? If the First Order was THAT fanatical about eliminating the Resistance\\, why not destroy the escaping ships first\\, then resume your focus on the base?\\nAnswer: Because that would be too easy\\, and defeat the entire point of the movie.\\nI'm not saying that the entire movie shouldn't have happened because if this first issue\\, but similar threads presented themselves during the movie that caught my eye. The biggest \\\"Assumption\\\" that I saw was the forcing of the \\\"love interest\\\" of Rose upon Fin. Not once in the entire film were we exposed to a \\\"look\\\" or a \\\"touch\\\" or a \\\"word\\\" that conveyed the notion that Rose would eventually care so much about Fin that she would jeapordize the entire future of the Resistance by saving his life. Here's how it stacks up to me:\\n-The First order has followed the Resistance to Crait.\\n-The Resistance is essentially trapped with no way of escape.\\n-The one implement of destruction that the First Order needs to break through the large armored doors is charging up.\\n-Fin knows that the only way to keep his friends safe is to destroy the \\\"Superlaser Siege Cannon\\\" by ramming his speeder into it.\\n-At the last second\\, Rose plows across the firing path\\, which Fin is almost at the point of impact\\, and stops him from blowing up not only the weapon\\, but himself along with it.\\n-The weapon fires and blasts the doors open.\\n-The First Order storms the base and kills all the remaining Resistance fighters........but wait....that's not what happened.\\n-Somehow Luke knew exactly what was going down and jumped in to save the day even though Rose had effectively handed the Resistance to the first Order on a silver platter.\\nIsn't it obvious? Rose kills everyone because of a completely unforeseen affection for Fin. But the only reason that happened\\, was because it \\\"assumed\\\" that someone would somehow save the day. We also know this as \\\"Deus ex Machina\\\".\\nI wouldn't have such an issue with this had it been present in any of the other films but it isn't. All of the other \\\"Save the Day\\\" moments are routinely executed by people with skills or force abilities.\\nIt's not that I think The Last Jedi was a terrible movie\\, The idea behind a lot of the cool themes was neat to see on screen\\, unfortunately I find the biggest issues I had with the movie was from a storytelling perspective. I could go more into detail but I think that's where I'll stop.\\nI have a dummy email account that I check from time to time\\, anyone who wishes to discuss these things with a fellow Star Wars fan\\, feel free to email me there. ( Fake1wes@gmail.com )\\nRegards\\, and May the Force Be With You\\, Always.\\n-Wes\\nAlso\\, I've decided to refrain from watching or listening to any theories or plot ideas for Episode 9 so as to watch it with a fresh perspective.","true":true}
