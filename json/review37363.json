{"101487":178055,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The positives for this movie are that I really liked seeing Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in their old roles again\\, even though I thought the character of Luke Skywalker took a very strange direction. A lot of the open questions and mysteries from TFA are answered\\, but not always in a way that makes sense.\\nThings I disliked (trying to avoid spoilers): The movie had a lot of poor\\, low-brow humor in it. One notable example is a prank call scene\\, which was just awful. A lot of the twists and surprises simply didn't work. M. Night Shyamalan could come up with better plot twists. The entire Finn & Rose subplot was truly awful. It had practically no payoff or purpose whatsoever.","true":true}
