Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hey!  How did the Tomatometer just jump to 91% for critics when most reviews are negative and still at 48%? Fishy fishy fishy!\\n\\nBig sigh. I'm one of those who didn't care for The Force Awakens\\, sadly. Yeah\\, I saw the original Trilogy back in 1977. And the Empire Strikes Back pretty much saved me from a deep depression back then... I was really hoping The Last Jedi would be the movie that changed it all. Like the joy when I first heard Star Wars was getting another chance after the prequels. How can this be going so wrong? How can they take our beloved characters and crap all over them? I'm glad John Boyega has Pacific Rim coming out in March cause he's been wasted in SW. No point in spewing TLJ's failings as so many have. I'm just so sad. Not sure my heart can take Episode 9. If they wanted to kill off the interest of original fans\\, they may have succeeded.","true":true}
