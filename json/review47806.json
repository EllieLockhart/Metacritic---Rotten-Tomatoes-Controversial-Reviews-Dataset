Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where I found The Force Awakens to be mediocre\\, The Last Jedi was exciting and fun to watch. The characters are better fleshed out\\, with complexity and conflict. Release any expectations you may have for this movie\\, and it may be more enjoyable than you think. This movie is unexpectedly even better upon a second viewing\\, where certain events that didn't initially make sense are clearer after another watch. There's a lot to unpack in this movie\\, and I found it highly enjoyable.","true":true}
