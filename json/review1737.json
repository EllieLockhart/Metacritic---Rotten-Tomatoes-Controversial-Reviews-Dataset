Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a standalone movie it was good. The story was good\\,  as was the acting and production value.  But as a star wars film it was not good. \\nThey really Twisted and bent the canon up\\,  especially the parts about the force. So it's definitely going in a new direction which I'm not too happy about. But if the film was a standalone sci fi flick I think it would habe been better received.","true":true}
