Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely destroys the basic format and foundation of the most beloved movie franchise of all time simply to push an agenda for the sake of pushing an agenda. Rey is still a Mary Sue with no character development\\, Finn is still comedic relief with no nuance or narrative\\, and Luke Skywalker( arguably the most loved character in the series) is a grumpy old man who hates everything and drinks green mild from some cow creature. Oh yea and Leia can use the force now because it looks cool. But hey\\, the movie looks great.","true":true}
