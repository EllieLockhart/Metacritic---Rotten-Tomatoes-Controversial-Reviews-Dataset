Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a poorly written movie to say the least. Any true Star Wars fan will see all the plot holes and dropped story lines. Does not leave much to look forward to in the next movie. I think the real issue is bouncing around on directors. JJ Abrams had a vision for this movie and Rian Johnson threw much of the intricacies away.","true":true}
