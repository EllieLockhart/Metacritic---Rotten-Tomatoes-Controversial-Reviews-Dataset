Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spaceballs 2 the death of a franchise. This movie is a utter disgrace. Disney you are a disgrace. Tomatoes you are at it. 48 % for a month now come on? Johnson you are a complete clown. If you thought this was bad check out the deleted scenes on YouTube. Scottish dance music in a star wars film? You're a plumb. Storm troopers with deep southern us accents arse slapping. Is this guy got mental attributes of a 10 year old? Congratulations all the best franchises are butchered. Aliens\\, predator\\, terminator and now Star Wars. This guy is gonna direct the next trilogy. You haven't told me anything in the last 2 movies. You should be giving people their money back it's false advertising it's not a Star Wars movie you hacks","true":true}
