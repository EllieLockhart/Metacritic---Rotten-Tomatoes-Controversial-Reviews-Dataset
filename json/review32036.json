Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers: I was amazed how Ryan Johnson took the risk of not just giving you what you thought was important and not just making a repeat of another Star Wars movie but it\u2019s own individual type of story with twist and turns but that was still very much Star Wars. It had flaws but so does a lot of movies. I came to enjoy A MOVIE not a religious event\\, and I did. And I also don\u2019t think that we know the truth about Rey still\\, but the fact that her heritage doesn\u2019t matter just goes to show how the force works. I\u2019m glad they killed snoke cuz I don\u2019t need another emperor I need something fresh and shocking and I was shocked by that scene. Finn\u2019s story line was definitely the flaw in the movie BUT EVEN THAT was at least enjoyable to a degree. All in all the immense struggle\\, nail biting adventure\\, plot twists NOBODY saw coming and yes even silly humor makes this a classic Star Wars like we haven\u2019t seen in a long time.
