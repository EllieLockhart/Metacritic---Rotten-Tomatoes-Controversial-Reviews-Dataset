Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good: Main characters are incredible actors\\, added more original creatures and locations\\, generally high production values across the board\\, some original ideas and successfully took some risks to add creative and at times entertaining story elements\\n\\nThe Bad: Painfully twisted plot elements to make progressive points\\, finished off the humiliation and or death scenes of all the main characters from the original series. Slow at times\\, overly complex\\, some extremely hard to swallow plot elements. The story often feels full of gimmicks and is way too complex.\\n\\nBottom Line: We tend to feel one or way or another about a movie first then make up reasons for it later. If your not concerned about staying true to the strong story telling and iconic sci fi elements of the original series or like their brand of progressive elements you may love this movie. If not your likely in for a massive disappointment.","true":true}
