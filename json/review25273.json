Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No cohesive message\\, kind of a mess. Many plot holes. Whole segments of the story are totally disconnected to the main part of the film. Mysteries from the previous movie aren't explained or even adressed. Most characters have no development and somehow manage to become shallower then they were at the start of the movie. Some really great scenes in it though.","true":true}
