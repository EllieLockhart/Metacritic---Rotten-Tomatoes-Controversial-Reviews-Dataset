Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Have seen the movie multiple times and can honestly say that after years of watching Star Wars movies\\, video games and conventions that this is possibly one of the bravest steps in the history of the franchise.\\n\\nIt's a film that yes has some flaws but it doesn't take away the decisions and directions of this trilogy and has made for a compelling middle arc in the story. I only hope that some of the negative criticism doesn't end up making Episode IX a softer film. There was once a time where Luke's father was unthinkable and in time I believe the unthinkable of Luke's character shift will change.","true":true}
