Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here's the deal with this movie\\, it is like a bad sci-fi movie with elements of Star Wars used as props.  There are AT-ATs\\, lightsabers and Yoda but this movie does not function as a bridge in a trilogy.  It neglected what came before it and makes me nervous about what could possibly follow it.  There was no contextualization present and that is why it failed as a so called part of this franchise.","true":true}
