Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed the movie.  It was entertaining\\, and overall was an excellent addition to the cinematic Star Wars cannon.  My one complaint is with the ending.  While I don't want to spoil it for others\\, I will say that the outcome of a major character's story arc was poorly explained\\, ill advised\\, and it took me out of the story.    Had it not been for that\\, this would have been a 4.5 star movie.","true":true}
