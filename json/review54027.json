Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can\u2019t believe this movie was even made. Terrible. Just utter garbage. At several times I almost got up and walked out\\, but stayed\\, hoping it would miraculously pull off a 180. \u201cHey here\u2019s a great idea. Let\u2019s remove the helmet of the main villainous character and leave it off for the entire movie. Oh and how about a shirtless telepathic Skype session? Have we done that yet in a Star Wars? Yeah\\, let\u2019s do that. Like a cheesy romantic comedy. Man. This is pure gold! Keep me coming guys\u201d Star Wars Is DEAD","true":true}
