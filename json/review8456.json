Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally got around to putting in my review despite seeing this day one in theaters\\, as I have with all Star Wars movies. This flick was one hot piece of garbage\\, riddled with plot holes\\, questionable decisions\\, and the halting of any momentum the new trilogy was building up. Rian Johnson\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, and Disney should be ashamed for letting this mess reach the big screen.","true":true}
