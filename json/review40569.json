Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst starwar movie ever!  The fight sucks\\, the plan suck\\, and the characters suck!  There was no explanation of who the hell is Snoke.  The Asian girl and Finn would just pick up some random dude (even they were told to pick up the specific person) to help them save the world. Finn was trying to destroy the cannon and the girl pull him out and said save what you love\\, but also let everyone die behind her. I was saying WTF the whole time. The light saber fight was hardly a fight\\, and Snork (supposed to be all powerful) was killed easily (and unknowingly) by a saber three inches away from him (are you freaking serious?). The movie had no depth\\, no plan\\, and no acting.","true":true}
