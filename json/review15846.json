Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVE Star Wars. This is the worst movie in the series. This director sucks. Please delete this from the series. Stop messing up my childhood. I had to come back and change my review because I didnt know you could just have 1\/2 a star. The more I think about this movie and what they have done with it\\, the angrier I get. This is as bad as Stephen King messing up Dark Tower. I despise what you have done to MY STAR WARS. What a waste. Mark Hammil isn't getting any younger and you squandered the chance you had to use him as Luke just a bit longer. And on top of crapping all over my childhood\\, you are going to make a billion dollars off this sorry ass movie. I should come to hollywood and kick you in the nads. I think my 6 year old could have done a better job than this crud. I dont know if I should cry or scream and just pound my fist into the monitor until my knuckles start bleeding from hitting the wall behind the monitor. Im going to need some serious drugs and counseling over this eventually. I need to find out who directed this movie so I dont accidentally watch any more of his subpar attempts. How does this guy even get a job in hollywood in the first place? He must have had a little metoo to have gotten in a position like that because it sure wasnt his unique skills or talents. I need a time machine so I can go back in time and prevent this turd from falling out.","true":true}
