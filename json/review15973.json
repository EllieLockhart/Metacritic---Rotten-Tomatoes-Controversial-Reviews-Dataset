Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account on here just for this movie. If you care at all about what Star Wars used to be then stop giving Disney your money to ruin a franchise loved by millions of people. \\n\\nThe story is riddled with holes\\, the sub plots are ridiculous\\, the characters are weak and their arcs (if they have any) are terrible. Dont even get me started on how they managed to insert their political agenda into this movie. By the way\\, all those things that were set up in TFA: completely ignored. The force makes no sense\\, the old characters dont act how they actually would if Rian Jonson had watched the original trilogy and you walk away just sad and disappointed (Just like how Luke is through the whole movie)\\n\\nDO NOT GO AND SEE IT.","true":true}
