Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No gaps filled with Character development like Snoke\\, or Rey's parents\\, or the Knights of Ren\\, are they Snoke's guards?  Why was  Ackbar killed offscreen\\, while Admiral Holdo (whom we didn't get to know) died \\\"valiantly\\\"? We've known ackbar for ages...Why haven't they done light speed kamakazis as a weapon in the first place\\, why now?  Why didn't Holdo just say her simple plan\\, so Poe could have followed and saved many lives by not trying to come up with a plan himself? Why was Luke always the character to help family and friends no matter what\\, but now he doesn't want to help Rey\\, and want(ed) to kill Ben Solo?  Kill Ben with no evidence?  How did snoke fall so easy with a mind meld with Kylo? After all he influenced him with no physical contact.  Why were there literally no men of an significant rank in the Resistance?  Why are all of the first order\\, men? Why did rose \\\"Save\\\" Finn for being what she loves\\, when finn was trying to save what he loved being the resistance.  And she caused his failure and made him inept even more so.  Finn is a weak boring character and makes men look bad.  It's as though the movie was written to make men look weak intentionally.  Obvious agenda\\, and destroyed the star wars universe.  Leia was running around the universe blasting troopers.  Padame was too\\, but there weren't enough strong women?  C'mon.","true":true}
