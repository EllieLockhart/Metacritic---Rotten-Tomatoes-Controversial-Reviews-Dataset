Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yep\\, Disney and Johnson shit the bed on this one.\\n\\nI am not a \\\"fanboy\\\" crybaby or a bot.  I signed up on RT just to review this steamy pile of poo.  I loved TFA and had high hopes for this movie\\, but the director forgot that he was making a STAR WARS movie and gave us a lecture on social issues wrapped in Marvel toilet paper.\\n\\nI was hoping to see some growth in the characters introduced to us in TFA.  Who is Snoke?  Who are Rey's parents?  Where will Kylo go from here?  Forget that.  Instead we are introduced to some new useless throw-away characters\\, whose names I don't even remember.  The girl with Finn is about a good an actress as the guy who played Anakin in the prequels.  Her addition to this movie served no purpose other than to preach to us about social issues.  I'd rather hear my local politician wax poetically on equality and such and such than see her in episode 9.\\n\\nFinn\\, Poe and Rey were neglected in this movie.  Their characters did not progress.  Luke was really screwed and went out like a chump.  Leia is apparently Mary Poppins and the First Order are a bunch of incompetent punks.  \\n\\nPlease Disney\\, go back to what made these movies special.  Good storytelling without the lectures on social issues.  Character development and great fights.  Save the rest of your cheesy humor and leftist agenda for something else.","true":true}
