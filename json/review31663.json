Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So Rey is now a mary sue and all-powerful Jedi who fails at nothing all the while receiving no training from the \\\"last jedi\\\" who dies at the end of the movie...\\n\\nIt was pretty good awful\\, maybe the solo movie will be better.","true":true}
