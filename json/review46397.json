Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was one of the best Star Wars movies ever! Absolutely loved that film and it had me at the edge of my seat the whole movie. Different then all the other Star Wars movies but it's a good different !","true":true}
