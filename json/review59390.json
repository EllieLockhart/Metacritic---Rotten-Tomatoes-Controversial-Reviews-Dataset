As such it lacks the emotionally compelling relational dynamics that made the first game so memorable. A key death is handled in a very convenient\\, random\\, degrading manner making it feel more like shock for the sake of shock than a well written plot point. Abbys character is handled poorly as the writing tries so hard to make you empathise with her but never truly does\\, while the ending feels utterly pointless\\, the moral lesson being\\, it\u2019s okay to torture lots of random innocent people but avenging a loved one is bad! This would be quite like return of the Jedi if darth vader got killed by a random Jedi\u2019s niece instead of us seeing the Luke \/Vader climax ( Joel\/Ellie\u2019s turbulent relationship after she learns the truth being the equivocal plot point we missed out on).In trying to subvert expectations it creates a boring and soulless plot and it\u2019s a real shame because the first remains amongst the most grim but inspiring stories of all time. Rest in peace!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
