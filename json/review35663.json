Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an incredible film- honoring the truest sense of the Star Wars legacy. It is action packed\\, fun\\, snarky at times\\, has a great score and story line\\, and continues the best Star Wars has always offered- with upgrades! My daughter\\, brother\\, and boyfriend all loved it\\, and we have seen it multiple times in the theater.  You're gonna love it (unless you're a racist\\, misogynistic terd). \\nEnjoy!","true":true}
