Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After some time to digest The Last Jedi\\, it may be almost as good as the Empire Strikes Back.  At first I didn't like the film's take on Luke\\, but as the movie progressed and more of the back story was revealed  I understood the director's take on him.  I may need to see it again to pick up on all of the \\\"call backs\\\" in the movie.","true":true}
