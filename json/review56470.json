Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the film falls short in many ways and destorys characters of the original series by contradicting behaviors in the previous movies while also adding unnecessary plot lines to an already long movie to teach a lesson that makes no sense to the plot but also doesnt give context to why the first order is so strong in this movie when in the last movie they were a tiny force but now they arent. the film also treats their audiences like idiots and doesnt give any intellectual storylinest to the audience and lets them think. too many misplaced jokes that were not well times and the ex machinas were in too plenty this film is a disgrace to the star wars films and as a huge fan is extremely dissapointing","true":true}
