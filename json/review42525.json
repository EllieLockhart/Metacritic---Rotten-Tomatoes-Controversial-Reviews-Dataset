Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie was a movie that took me full circle from the first movie of a young couples life to the end of ones life. I was there in the beginning and it is now complete for me. Thank you looking forward to more.","true":true}
