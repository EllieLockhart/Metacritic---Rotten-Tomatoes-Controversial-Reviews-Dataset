Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"should easily be below 40% by now Rotten Tomatoes can no longer be taken serious as a credible review site\\, oh yes and the movie was one of the most insulting pieces of shit I've ever had the seen.","true":true}
