Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly\\, I really didn't like this one. I'm a big Star Wars fan and it was pretty disappointing to see such a mess of a movie. Other reviewers have written extensively on the movie's shortcomings and I don't have much to add to what has already been said. Turning a childhood hero into a mopey\\, alien sea cow milking loser was the ultimate injustice to the franchise. I have no interest in episode IX.","true":true}
