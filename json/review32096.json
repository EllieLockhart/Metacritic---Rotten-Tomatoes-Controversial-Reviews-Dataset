Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS\\, obviously.\\n\\nThe prophecy was always that Anakin would restore balance to the Force. Turns out he did that by becoming a Sith Lord and cancelling out the Sith with the Jedi using the power of familial ties.Which leaves Star Wars with a \\\"balanced\\\" Force which now spontaneously creates supervillains and their \\\"balanced\\\" superheroes from nowhere\\, no specialized Sith or Jedi training required. In fact\\, such relics as mentorship\\, training\\, learning curve\\, maturation\\, and dues paying are all summarily dismissed and their symbols and canon literature literally burned to ashes. On both sides. Perhaps we have here a relic of the now-discredited educational \\\"gifted kids program\\\" disaster of the 80s and 90s. Who needs to pay dues and learn the ropes by intense structured practice and guidance when you are the natural born prodigy who can summon powers at will? If you feel like this picture was telling you that you belong to an obsolete fandom for which the future has no use\\, except maybe as the ATM from which your kids will draw their Star Wars theme park admission charge\\, you are not alone. Several scenes provide apt metaphors for the real world phenomena of Last Jedi. Hamill's visible disgust at the blue milk is very like his public comments on the process - he was disgusted\\, but he had to suck it down anyway. The 16-hour taligating-in-space pursuit\\, ending in a maneuver which invalidates the entire franchise premise of space combat looks remarkably like the reports of the writing process - it followed the canon through a meandering course of conflicted maneuvers only to blow it all up for lack of a better idea. Luke's gesture of flicking a dust mote from his shoulder after the ATAT blast-fest is emblematic of the relative status of the old characters to the relative impotence and diminished interest of the new ones. Perhaps Mr. Johnson believed he was paying homage to Luke's master status\\, but such a display of power from Luke also reveals the absence of any reason to be intimidated\\, or even interested in Kylo. The evil once represented by one of the most compelling screen villains of all time may now be whisked away by a flick of the fingers. As may future installments of this soap opera in space\\, a far cry from the space opera Lucas invented.","true":true}
