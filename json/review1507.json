Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge starwars fan my whole life I was disgusted with the last film and even more so with this film. My first intention is to call it a fan film but that would be disrespectful to fan films made by actual Star Wars fans that understand what Star Wars actually is. All Disney has done is make a couple of garbage movies packaged in Star Wars costumes and themes. This movie\\, written and directed by pc principle himself\\, is a good movie for little kids with no idea what Star Wars is or adults with no idea what  Star Wars is but \\\"saw a lightsaber with that guy that one time\\\". I wanted to leave 3 times during this film\\, which chokes me up to even think about considering this is a STAR WARS film we are talking about.","true":true}
