Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi disappointed me on so many levels. The humor felt forced and many of the key plot points from TFA were completely tossed out the window. When I initially left the theater\\, I was happy with what I saw\\, then reality hit when I started to realize that the story was a broken mess.\\n\\nSad to say\\, but I have no excitement or feelings of anticipation for 9. Just gonna hope that things are improved with the next installment.","true":true}
