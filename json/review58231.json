Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1 star for the visuals\\, a half star because it's  star wars movie. And that is about the only good thing i can say about this movie. RJ didn't see any of the OT and Luke Skywalker isn't luke Skywalker. They used the people from the OT to draw us old fans in\\, but then they deliver this heap of garbage. They should've gone with something totally new in a different era in the universe.","true":true}
