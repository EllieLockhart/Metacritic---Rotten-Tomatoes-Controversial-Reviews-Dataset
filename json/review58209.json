Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"zero stars This thing had so many plot holes it was like looking through swiss cheese.\\nRian Johnson took a huge dump on a 40 year epic story.\\nComplete failure with the treatment of Luke Skywalker... if you were going to kill him ...he should have gone out Wolverine\/Akira style \\, laying waste to EVERYTHING in Person\\, not the little wuss way he supposedly did (maybe JJ Abrams can figure out how to resurrect him.\\nLeaia flying\\, milking a creature fishing with a long stick \\, THROWING HIS LIGHTSABER IN THE OCEAN... leaving a map for none to find him ...
