Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not the best Star Wars movie but don't be a dick. Good ending to the Skywalker line and the general organa in space dies with a force pull was dumb but an icon died so there's some leverage there.  Luke projecting was well done and worth it for punking Kylo. \\n\\nExcited to see Rey's\\, Fin's\\, and Poe's trajectory. Too many empire and Jedi parallels with Kylo\\n\\nSnokes story is interesting \\nBetter to see what people can do but mostly using the force to exist. Not for good or bad but for the galaxy","true":true}
