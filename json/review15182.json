Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked it the first time I saw it. Second time around I couldn\u2019t ignore major character and story flaws. It is still Star Wars so that is fun but I wish George Lucas was back writing them. ","true":true}
