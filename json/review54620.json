Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In 1977 when I first saw Star Wars in the theaters\\, it sparked something inside me\\, so I have always been a fan. Regardless of what anyone thinks about TLJ\\, (I have some issues but still enjoyed it) it sparked something in my 13-year-old daughter when I took her to see it a few days ago. Even though she's grown up with me watching Star Wars constantly over the years and even went with me to to theater to see TFA\\, she's never shown any interest\\, but now she's a Star Wars nerd like her dad. That alone makes TLJ good enough for me.","true":true}
