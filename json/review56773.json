Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good thing about this film were the visuals. The storyline did nothing to build up on existing characters from the previous film. In fact they managed to destroy all the work Abraham's put into it and take a huge dump on Lucas as well. Worst follow up movie I've ever seen don't waste your money with it.","true":true}
