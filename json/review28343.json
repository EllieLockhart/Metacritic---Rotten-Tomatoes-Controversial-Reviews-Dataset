Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Por fin una pel\u00edcula de star wars arriesgada \\, sorprendente \\, muy muy arriesgada y \u00e9pica. Que tiene cosas malas \\, claro que s\u00ed \\, pero es un pelicul\u00f3n que te deja sin aliento\\, te gustar\u00e1n mas o menos las decisiones tomadas pero por fin star wars ha sido impredecible.","true":false}
