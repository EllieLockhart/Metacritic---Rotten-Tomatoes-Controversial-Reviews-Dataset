Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What to say.. This chapter of Star Wars is tearing down what the last 7 movies was building up. I breaks my fan heart to see such a bad attempt at a Star Wars movie with such potential. I really really hope that JJ Abrahams can fix the mess that Rian Johnson made in the upcoming Episode 9. Good Luck JJ!","true":true}
