Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply put: I am disappointed in the story direction. The way this film handled the end of Luke's story was a disservice. The side plot of looking for the hacker was absolutely pointless. The fuel issues\/hyperspace tracking elements were awful. So was the fact that the Rebel ships could just pluck along at sub-light speeds and magically keep ahead of every First Order ship. There wasn't a single military mind in the first order who thought it would be a good idea to jump forces around\/ahead of them and head them off? The Rey\/Kylo story was the only quality part of the film. Incredibly disappointing.","true":true}
