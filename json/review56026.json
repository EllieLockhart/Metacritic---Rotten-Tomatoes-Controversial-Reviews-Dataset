Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Since this film has shown to be divisive\\, let me start by saying I'm a huge Star Wars fan that didn't really enjoy the prequels. I thought Episode 7 was brilliantly done. The Last Jedi treads on dangerous\\, hallowed ground and manages to build something new and great on it. It has\\, objectively\\, the best action of any Star Wars film. It has the best acting. It has the most intriguing plot (helped by its hefty runtime). It has the usual amount of fan service without feeling like it only exists to cater to mega fans. A couple of parts felt like departures from the tone of previous Star Wars films\\, which is entirely consistent with the message of the film! A very few parts left me scratching my head\\, but too many reviews forget the outright zaniness of Star Wars. Many die hard fans wanted off the train after seeing Episode VII. We're seeing a few more getting off now. But it is unfair to blame this fantastic adventure and example of the childlike joy that made us all fall in love with Star Wars in the first place.
