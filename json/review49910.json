Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You'd think \\\"It's Star Wars! How can you go wrong?!\\\" But oh how bad is this movie! It is a literal stinking dumpster fire of a story. There were about 10 different sub plots over the course of 2 and 1\/2 hours that felt like they were written by a 15 year old on fanfiction.com. Littered with dull jokes and piss poor dialogue\\, I felt like I was watching a boring Star Wars parody on YouTube than an actual continuation of the saga. There is no character development because it seems the writers forgot to write in a main character\\, there's no plot development either because the writers seemed to forget that a story needs one of those too; it was seriously just a bunch of random shit thrown together and called \\\"Star Wars.\\\"\\nDisney is proof that the blind desire for corporate profit destroys everything and anything that is good. Rian Johnson the director is a hack and producer Kathleen Kennedy is running this franchise into the god forsaken ground. I had heard so many bad things about it before going to see it\\, thinking \\\"how bad could it really be?\\\" Folks\\, it IS that bad. Please save your money on this one\\, this movie is an effigy of a middle finger to every fan of the saga; and to the saga itself for that matter.","true":true}
