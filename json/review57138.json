Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a poorly made film technically but it is a poorly thought out chapter to the new trilogy.  Rian Johnson believes that simply subverting expectations of the audience is enough to save Star Wars and keep it creatively fresh. I don't believe people come to see a Star Wars film to be told \\\"nothing matters\\\".  No this is a disappointment to the franchise and it sticks out like a sore thumb because TLJ does not carry the story laid out in TFA smoothly and consistently.  Instead Johnson decides to throw out everything set up in the previous movie to do nothing with it.  Yes Rian very creative indeed.  It's just a mess\\, the film just feels like it's going nowhere and the handling of some characters people were looking forward to seeing was just heartbreaking.  I'm a big SW fan but the sequel trilogy is more enjoyable without TLJ.","true":true}
