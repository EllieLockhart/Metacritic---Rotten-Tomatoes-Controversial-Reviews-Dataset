Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is shit! The last star wars i'll pay to see. They destroyed the classic characters\\, treating them like cowards. Plot holes\\, sub-plot holes and shit. Fuck this movie. The critics are bought or they are just retarded.","true":true}
