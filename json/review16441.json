Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im sorry this was a huge letdown.  After waiting 35 years for Luke to be back on the big screen he was portrayed in a way that will leave millions of fans wondering WTF happened with this story line?  You can clearly see that Disney simply cares about moving the old characters out so they can create a new line of characters for the franchise.  I get it.  But.... that being said to turn Luke into a brooding hermit with a cynical sense of humor that really doesnt seem to care about anything.  Just a huge miss all around.","true":true}
