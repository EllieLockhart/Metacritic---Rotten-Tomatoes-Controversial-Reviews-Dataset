Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just don't name it Star Wars.\\nGender Wars\\, Save the Alien Horses\\, Spaceballs 2\\, Verified Twitter Strikes Back\\, Grumpy old Yedi\\, Toxic White Men Can't Hyperjump\\, Spaceship Potemkin Act 1: Wamen and F*ggots\\, My Lineage Name is Nobody\\, One Night at Mary Sue's...ANYTHING BUT STAR WARS!!!","true":true}
