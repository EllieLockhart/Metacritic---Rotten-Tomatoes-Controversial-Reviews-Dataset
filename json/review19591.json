Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It took the characters we actually cared about crapped on them and killed them in disrespectful ways. Not to mention the new characters were written completely different from how they had been established in the previous film.","true":true}
