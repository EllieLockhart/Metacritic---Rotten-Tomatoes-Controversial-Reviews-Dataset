Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a terrible movie but a very disappointing one. The movie is basically one long car chase scene with useless subplots and characters. I haven't scene a movie waste so many potential characters before in my life. TLJ does nothing to build up for episode 9. This movie has definitely divided the Star Wars fanbase.","true":true}
