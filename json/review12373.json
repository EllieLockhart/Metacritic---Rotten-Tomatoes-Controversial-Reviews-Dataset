Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I applaud anyone attempting to make a Star Wars movie\\, because the first three movies from 40 years ago were so mind blowing and groundbreaking that they gained a massive advantage from the \\\"awe\\\" they delivered -- not just from the spectacle\\, but from the spiritual and philosophical elements as well. To try and compete with that is impossible\\, so I have a much simpler group of tests:\\nDid I get my money's worth? Yes\\nWas I entertained? Yes\\nDid the movie pay homage to the originals? Yes\\nDid it feel like a Star Wars movie? Yes\\nWas there not too much Jar Jar ridiculousness? Yes\\, but barely.\\nWas the \\\"reluctant hero\\\" thing done right\\, with a good final delivery? YES\\n\\nThis final test was what did it for me. Han didn't want to help\\, Yoda didn't want to help\\, and Maverick didn't want to help\\, but in the end they all did. That's what we come to see -- the good guy finally getting over his baggage and delivering victory. Well done\\, Luke.","true":true}
