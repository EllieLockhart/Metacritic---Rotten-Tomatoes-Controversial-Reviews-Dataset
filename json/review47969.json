Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it's better than Episode VII\\, it's still a patently bad film. Much of the film spends necessary time correcting the mistakes of the previous film. Certain plot points simply could not be followed through on. The characters gain no additional depth and the plot\\, while momentarily exciting\\, is not permanence or meaning. Rey is still a Mary-Sue and Kylo is still a mentally unstable and less entertaining version of Hayden Christiansen's Anakin. All of the events in Episode VII are quickly forgotten by the viewer\\, but what bothers me most is that the characters and setting have also forgotten. Internal consistency in the franchise is now entirely absent.","true":true}
