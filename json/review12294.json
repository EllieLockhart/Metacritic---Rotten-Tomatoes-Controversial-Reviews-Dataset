Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am really disappointed from this movie!Can't believe Star Wars is catering to feminists....The movie had a few cool moments but as a whole\\,it's trying to make a point that females can also do everything cool but I think it's overdoing it\\,way too much females being brave\\,fearless...it just looks unnatural.I am never paying again to go to the cinema and see another Star Wars movie.I'll just wait a week or two after it officially launches and download it.You can thank Rian Johnson for that.","true":true}
