Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t know why everyone is not liking this movie. Sorry it wasn\u2019t a plot by plot \u201csafe\u201d movie. Give it time. Everyone will turn. Let\u2019s break it down. Compared to \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d it had better comedic elements\\, better creatures\\, better twists\\, more emotional elements\\, a better score\\, better locations\\, better fight scenes\\, better acting\\, Benicio Del Toro\\, Laura Dern\\, better pacing\\, better editing\\, and Yoda as a puppet and not CGI. Also\\, I didn\u2019t want this one to end whereas last time it felt like time was up for the story. I think this one will stand on its own no matter how J.J. Abrams ends it. ","true":true}
