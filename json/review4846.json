Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Confused and Disappointed\\n\\nI went to see this movie to the first screening. Waited 2 hours to get the tickets so I would say that Im a fan. After episode 7 I was excited that this might turn out something good. I enjoyed TFA but its far from the best Star Wars movie. I had my hopes up to this one but it destroys everything 7 builds up and these movies ruins everything OT and prequels have done to this franchise. They should have kept George's story and someone else directing the movies. These new movies are missing the \\\"Star Wars feeling\\\" George's Star Wars had. There were good scenes but most of them was ruined with some stupid humour. This made my rating to from 3\/5 to 1\\,5\/5. In overall if you are an Star wars fan you will see all the bad and the couple of good things in this movie. If you are an average movie goer\\, not a fan who has seen the movies 391491 times you will enjoy the movie.","true":true}
