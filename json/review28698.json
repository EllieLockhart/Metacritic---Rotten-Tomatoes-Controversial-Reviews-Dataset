Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pure trash. You'll enjoy this movie if you've never really been a Star Wars fan\\, are a sjw\\, or absolutely hate Luke skywalker. Also very funny how people try to blame Russian bots or some other bs excuse for people not eating up this garbage.","true":true}
