Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like how all the past Presidents and Sit Com characters of June 13 thought this film was better than CITIZEN KANE.I also know these shills appreciate that Disney hates a certain pale demographic as much as they do. But this film was bad and they should feel bad for artificially boosting it.","true":true}
