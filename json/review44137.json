Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To be honest I never write reviews on this website but I felt compelled to write at least this short one. As an avid movie goer I thoroughly enjoy getting lost and emotionally attached to a story and it's characters. After watching this film I could not help but have this feeling that something was missing from my \\\"Star Wars\\\" experience. Looking past all of the amazing visuals and special effects this film at it's core does almost nothing to draw the audience in emotionally with the exception of nostalgia for the older audience or whoever has seen the original trilogy. I am not knocking all of the new \\\"Star Wars\\\" movies as a whole. I would rate \\\"Rogue One\\\" exceptionally higher over this movie based on originality and character development. Overall\\, \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" made me cringe and makes me wish it was \\\"The Last episode\\\".","true":true}
