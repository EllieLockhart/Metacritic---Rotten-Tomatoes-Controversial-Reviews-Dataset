Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is extraordinary. It surpassed all of my fairly high expectations. It fleshes out every character (the ones we've known for 40 years and the ones introduced in The Force Awakens) in intelligent\\, logical ways. It even fleshes out the force. For once we have a Star Wars movie that doesn't only see the force as a blunt instrument. So often in the movie it is used gracefully\\, in ways that are perfectly logical in that universe.\\nThe action is breathtaking (the opening ten minutes alone contain fist pumping heroism\\, extremely funny comedy and heartbreaking tragedy all within one stunning space battle - I would be hard-pressed to think of a Star Wars movie that starts better).\\nThere are three prominent new characters: Laura Dern's Vice Admiral Holdo\\, Benicio Del Toro's DJ and\\, best of all\\, Kelly Marie Tran's incredible Tiko Rose. All of these additions are great and have at least one iconic movie moment\\, but Tiko Rose will goddamn win you over. I cannot wait to see more of her in future instalments.\\nPoe Dameron stops being perfect without losing an ounce of his characteristic defacto awesomeness. Finn has to decide if he wants to really be a rebel hero or if he wants to just save his friends and gtfo. Rey needs to work out what she should do with this incredible power that has awakened in her\\, and who she should choose to help guide her through that.\\nThat brings us to Kilo Ren\\, the unsung mvp of this new franchise and a character endlessly more interesting than Darth Vader (yes.) Adam Driver does fantastic things with this character\\, who grows so much in this movie (compared to where he was in Force Awakens)\\, and his final showdown against Luke Skywalker is the stuff I buy movie tickets for.\\nAnd make no mistake\\, this is Luke Skywalker's movie through and through. What writer-director Rian Johnson has done here is nothing short of brilliant\\, subverting our expectations time and again in ways that are completely in keeping with the character\\, until Luke's gorgeous final moments in this movie - which are perfect and beautiful.\\nA few side notes real quick: Johnson stages one of the best fight scene in the entire series (the throne room duel)\\, a lot of the things I didn't like about Force Awakens (and I stand by that movie\\, it's a fantastic re-introduction to that universe) are addressed and fixed in brilliant ways\\, BB8 is still the best\\, Mark Hamill is incredible\\, everyone in this movie fails at one point or another and I love that\\, this movie is really funny\\, you can never have too much General Hux\\, Leia Organa is perfect\\, Mark Hamill is incredible.","true":true}
