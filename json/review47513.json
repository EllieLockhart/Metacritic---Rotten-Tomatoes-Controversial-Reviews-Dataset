Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What makes this film arguably the best in the entire saga is its honest storytelling and heart-felt message of hope and what it means to be a person who believes. Hope\\, family\\, friendship\\, loyalty\\, and saving the ones you love are what allow people to survive in a world torn by tyranny and hatred. Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi wasn't just a Star Wars film\\, it was a life lesson.","true":true}
