{"101487":190268,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly awful. \\nSpecial effects are ok\\, about on par with a AAA video game trailer. The famous Lucas beauty shots and vast\\, epic space battles that were a signature note of earlier films are conspicuously absent. Instead\\, familiar designs like Star Destroyers and AT-ATs are stuck next to ugly\\, cartoonish\\, giant caricatures of themselves.\\nCharacters are cardboard and written around a blatantly progressive narrative- the heroine is a Mary Sue\\, the co-star is an escaped slave\\, played by a black man\\, rescued by a very middle class white woman. The admiral is a purple haired freak whose main mission in life seems to be telling off her best pilot for being male\\, brave and impetuous. Much loved characters from the series are reduced to cameo roles in the billion dollar franchise they helped create. Even Luke Skywalker is re-written as a cowardly\\, suicidally depressed straight white male. \\nThe plot revolves around the slowest\\, most boring chase in sci-fi history (surprising twists? what are the 'pro' reviewers on?) broken up with painfully wooden scenes inserted to give an excuse to put all of the main male characters on their backside and at the mercy of a female cast member.  \\nActing for the most part is equally forced and artificial- the most cringe\\, from a sea of it\\, was probably Leia and purple freak sniggering when they say 'May the Force be with you' together. Why would they find a blessing from the galaxy's greatest religion funny? Can you imagine two characters in a Gulf War movie falling about when they both say 'As-Salaam-Alaikum' at the same time? The entire cast- with the notable exception of Mark Hamill- seem intent on giving theatre performances; the 'nudge-nudge\\, wink-wink\\, we know you're there watching all this silliness' is a grating constant throughout the over long screening.\\nThe main theme of the movie seems to be that men are toxic\\, easily managed and should just sit down\\, shut up and let women run the show\\, rather than the long established Star Wars staple of good vs evil\\, light vs dark and the need to balance the two extremes.\\nThe second part of any trilogy is used to set up the finale; in this case that involves burning anything related to the preceding films- literally\\, in the case of the Jedi religion.\\nI deeply regret going to see this horrific travesty; before Star Wars sci fi movies were almost gauranteed to be dismal\\, I'm devastated to see Star Wars lead the way back to that era.\\nAvoid it if you can\\, people. No-one would waste money on this dross if it didn't say Star Wars on the billboard. If Disney are serious about killing the original franchise then fine\\, I'll help them do it. I'll start by never going to see anything with Star Wars in the title ever again...","true":true}
