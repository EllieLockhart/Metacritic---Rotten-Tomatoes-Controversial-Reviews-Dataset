Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know how to feel about this movie. It's beautiful...but kind of pointless in the overall story of the trilogy. Every time something interesting is presented to the audience\\, it is almost immediately taken away. My expectations were very high going into this movie\\, so I was disappointed.","true":true}
