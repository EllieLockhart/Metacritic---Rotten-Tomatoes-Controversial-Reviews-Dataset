Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My first review!  I am so passionate about how BAD this film is that I had to pile on the hate. \\n\\nCharacter assasinations\\, cringe-worthy moments\\, universe-breaking maneuvers\\, plot holes\\, throw-away characters and events\\, and a complete defiance of any and all fan expectations made for one train wreck of a film.  \\n\\nWho's Snoke? Doesn't matter. Same with Rey's parents. Why's Luke so angry? And WHAT is he doing?! Oh\\, he sensed a bit of evil in his student and created the new Vader. Even though Luke was the ONLY one who could redeem Vader in the first place.    So now he lives in isolation to... die. Well\\, what's new? Okay so\\, get this\\, the bad guys have a massive new ship now--OoOo!  Why is the Republic STILL not fighting back--and is EVERYONE in this movie militarily incompetent?! STOP ASKING QUESTIONS!!\\n\\nObservational quips:\\nDang--ALL these ships are just CRAWLING along. Show me them man-titties\\, Kylo! What's up with these weird Marvel-like jokes more forced than a constipated turd? OH LOOK SPACE POPPINS!! So is Purple Hair... evil?  Nah\\, apparently just DEEPLY (and needlessly) secretive--are we expected to just sit here in a slow-speed space chase and die?! Couldn't you have just parked somewhere less... conspicuous? Why doesn't everyone hyperspace ram?! Oh man\\, sacrifice sure seems to factor big into this mov...wait wtf did that dead-inside Asian chick just do?! Why are you kissing...? Oh look\\, it's Luke--finally. Oh\\, but it's not Luke. Oh\\, there's Luke! Oh\\, Luke's dead.\\n\\nWas some of it cool to watch? Hell yeah-just like a real train wreak. But also like a real train wreck\\, SOMEone is gonna have to pick up the pieces... Good luck\\, J.J.","true":true}
