Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't love it. I don't hate it. It feels too long\\, parts of it were unnecessary\\, and parts of it were dumb\\, but there were some cool moments and I like some the interesting things they did with the story. It's definitely a mixed bag.","true":true}
