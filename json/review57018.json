Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This episode in the Star Wars series had me thinking about its motifs and meaning long after the movie ended. While the Force Awakens was an enjoyable throw-back that plucked at the heartstrings of a sentimental audience\\, it was all largely expected - a reiteration of what we've seen (and loved) before. After the Force Awakens\\, my most burning question was\\, \\\"who are Rey's parents?\\\" After Last Jedi\\, my lingering questions are much deeper. I love the idea that the Force exists beyond the notions of Jedi and Sith\\, that it doesn't belong to a religion or bloodline. I'm excited that the story will evolve\\, while not entirely abandoning the history and basic principles of this Universe. I love the purposeful way in which the filmmakers set up familiar scenes\\, and then pivoted away from the expected result. I didn't leave the theater with the same child-like excitement I experienced when I saw the Force Awakens\\, and maybe that's why folks are disappointed\\, but I think this was an enjoyable\\, thoughtful - and probably necessary - next step in the story. I'm excited to see where it all goes from here and not just because I want to know who someone's parents are.","true":true}
