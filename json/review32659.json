Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi\\, is not a perfect film I will say that. However with some of it's flaws it has great moments that changes how Star Wars is for the future and possibly the past if there is an Old Republic Reboot. The only bad parts were the Casino and Fin and Rose storyline\\, I loved Fin from The Force Awakens but he really felt left out in this film and useless. This film shares lots of similarities with Empire Strikes Back\\, but is also completely different from the regular Star Wars formula.  If you couldn't tell how different the tone was gonna be from The deliberate Red Stroke of Star Wars and Red being everywhere in the marketing and the title of The Last Jedi than you are an idiot. The trailers showed you that this was going to change things\\, it was going to take risks\\, look at the trailers for The Force Awakens and Look at The Trailers for The Last Jedi\\, they are completely different tonely speaking. This film for me is a 95%\\, If it wasn't for the Casino section and Rose's character than it would be perfect. I really wanted to see a Fin and Poe brotrip instead of awkward mission that didn't have any real story impacting outcomes to it.","true":true}
