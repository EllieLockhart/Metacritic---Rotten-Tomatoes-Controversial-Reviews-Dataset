Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like the original trilogy\\, The Last Jedi is whimsical\\, exhilarating\\, and ahead of its time! Although many dispute its authenticity to the saga\\, I believe the clear equality of male and female heroic scenes and perplexing turn of events in the plot were quite refreshing. I would also say that these contribute to its place in the Star Wars saga. The latent premise in all of the Star Wars movies was to capture our imaginations with seemingly impossible and connect with our shared pursuit of fulfillment in life and overcoming the oppressive agents in our world. To say that this movie doesn't honor and add dimension to that would be foolish. Plus\\, like the previous second installments\\, The Last Jedi left me with eager anticipation for the next film. Well done!","true":true}
