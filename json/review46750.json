Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, all I have to say is a huge \\\"THANK YOU\\\"  to Rian Johnson for not making another dump down enough movie for stupids with no life to like! The Last Jedi is visually stunning\\, it goes deep into it's characters' journey\\, especially with Kylo Ren\\, it is well-crafted and it deviates from the black-white perpsective of George Lucas' original trilogy! I am so glad we can finally see some depth in an overly simplistic franchise\\, and I say that as a Star Wars fan\\, though with a broader knowledge in film studies! Yes we all love it because it was part of our childhood\\, but the Last Jedi was the first movie in this franchise that didn't make you feel like a 12 year old... Again\\, thank you Rian Johnson! Don't worry\\, this will go down as one of the best films up in the franchise!","true":true}
