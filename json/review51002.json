Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely amazing. \\n\\nI saw it only once thus far\\, so I am sure I missed a lot\\, but it is taking things in a new direction while play homage to a lot of stuff that has come before in the film series. \\n\\nSeriously\\, check it out. I plan on seeing it about 6 or 7 or 8 or 10 times while it's in the theaters.\\n\\nLUKE IS BACK!!!","true":true}
