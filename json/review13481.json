Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If all you want is your version of Star Wars you may really hate this film. If you are open to a new direction for the series then you will have fun and enjoy a really good installment into the Star Wars franchise. The only reason it's not five stars is because I was hoping to see more happen with certain characters. \\nI encourage everyone to see it twice just to give yourself a good chance to process everything. All in all the future of Star Wars is bright.","true":true}
