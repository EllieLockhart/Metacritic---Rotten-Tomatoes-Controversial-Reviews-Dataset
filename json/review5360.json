Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Demolished and humiliated all of the classic characters to elevate the boring Rey.  Rose Tico and the Canto Blight subplot are completely irrelevant to the story.  Contradicted all previous movies and canon.  Forgettable.","true":true}
