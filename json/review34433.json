Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best part of The Last Jedi is Mark Hamill's performance. While it's enjoyable as a stand-alone cash grab featuring great acting and some fun sequences\\, The Last Jedi was very poorly written\\, including no character development\\, several plot holes\\, and pointless sub-plots\\, making this film the worst in the series and puts Episode 9 in a tough position to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the sequel trilogy as well as the saga.","true":true}
