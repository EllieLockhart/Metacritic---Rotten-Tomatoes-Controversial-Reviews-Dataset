Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely the worst Star Wars movie ever! It was slow\\, boring\\, and under developed. The best thing about this episode is that it ended! Disney ruined a magnificent SIFI legacy!","true":true}
