Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nice visuals and some interesting ideas mixed in with some stellar performances can't make up for a very weak script. Poor characterisation\\, painfully overstuffed with an emphasis on themes that don't hold up under scrutiny. Frankly\\, for a film that seems to insist on doing things different to the old franchise it goes about doing this by making up problems from the old films and 'fixing' them. The themes themselves were heavy handed and poorly realised\\, and the story contained plot holes big enough to drive through\\, Overall\\, the most disappointing experience with a Star Wars film I've ever had. Subversive for the sake of subversive is\\, ultimately\\, no less tedious than the most by-the-numbers Star Wars plot.","true":true}
