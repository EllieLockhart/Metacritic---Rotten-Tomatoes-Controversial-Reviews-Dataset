Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is hot garbage. It is a soulless and hollow shell\\, and Disney does not care if it breaks so long as they can get to the money inside. In this sense\\, it is more like a piggy bank than a movie. If you haven't seen it don't\\, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth and taint your memories of the original trilogy. Episode 9 doesn't deserve a chance after this.","true":true}
