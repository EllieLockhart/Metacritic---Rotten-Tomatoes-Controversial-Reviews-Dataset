Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie is visually and auditorily superb (as with prior Star Wars movies)\\, the story itself is disjointed\\, uninspiring and soulless to an extent that it makes the entire movie a painful labor to watch. Major characters in this movie do either virtually nothing at all or else do things that are blatantly contrived (so that they have something to do) and out of character. It seems the whole goal of the story in this movie is to try to teach you there is nothing special about the heroes involved. This movie has done great damage to the legacy of Star Wars\\, and that is saying a lot given prior pathetic submissions like The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.","true":true}
