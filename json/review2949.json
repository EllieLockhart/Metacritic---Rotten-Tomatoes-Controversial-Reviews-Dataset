Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Baaaad. Most scenes were a waste of time and dont go anywhere. The whole visit to the casino planet was messy and ended up costing the rebellion way more than if they hadnt even tried. Am I actually supposed to root for the main characters if they end up indirectly getting everybody killed? All the questions from star wars 7 were answered in a lazy way that lacked any passion.","true":true}
