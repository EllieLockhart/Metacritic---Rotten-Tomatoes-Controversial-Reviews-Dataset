Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie single handedly marred the franchise\\, one of the most beloved franchises in cinematic history. Not only were pointless and random characters introduced\\, existing ones made little to no progression throughout the movie\\, and if anything regressed in terms of development. The sheer ridiculousness of Rian's Vision made the movie frustrating to the point of unenjoyability. He should not be allowed to participate in the making of any more franchise films for the foreseeable future.","true":true}
