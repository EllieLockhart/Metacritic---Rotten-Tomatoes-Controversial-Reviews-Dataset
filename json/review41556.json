Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is excellent.  I don't know what all of the whining is about.  I love how Rey is a 'nobody'\\, just like Anakin was.  Great parallel there.  Then the 'nobody' slave boy at the end... My one complaint about this movie\\, the reason I'm giving it 4.5 instead of 5 stars.... The 3-4 dry humor bits just felt... corny... Not at all like Star Wars.  They were just awkward.\\n\\nIf you're on the fence about seeing the movie\\, don't be... Go see it.  The Force Awakens was fantastic and The Last Jedi is a great follow up.  I do expect episode IX to blow me away though.","true":true}
