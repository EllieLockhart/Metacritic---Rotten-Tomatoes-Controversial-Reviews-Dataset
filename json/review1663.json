Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie\\, it's ok. The overall sound seems decent\\, though it can be hard to hear some dialogue\\, which is critical for the new spin on things. As a Star Wars movie I hate it. Guardians of the Galaxy is a good movie\\, taking a long standing universe like Star Wars and treating it to GotG style comedy and expecting it to fly is bad form. Star Wars has always had humor\\, but this isn't the same school of it.\\n\\nThen let's throw away everything we know about some of of longest running characters in Star Wars. The universe and all its history be damned\\, these characters can do whatever the hell they want. It isn't a terrible story\\, but it isn't in line with everything we've seen so far. I couldn't enjoy the movie as I was constantly trying to reconcile what I was seeing with all I already know about Star Wars.","true":true}
