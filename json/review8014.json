Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Faithful to the saga but Rey is so wasted\\, or perhaps saved for the big battle in the last chapter. She has nearly no role to play in preparation for the finale. This is in general true for all the leads on both the sides\\, as they are pulled back from big battles to remain intact for now. In the absence of major warfares involving the young\\, more could have been done with both Luke and Snoke. Overall\\, spectacular and engaging.","true":true}
