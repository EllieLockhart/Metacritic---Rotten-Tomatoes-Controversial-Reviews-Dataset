Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is terrible. I actually got bored. The ship chase made no sense!! They ruined Luke\u2019s character. They wasted Snoke as a character. They sent Fen on a pointless mission. They failed to develop Rey\u2019s character. For no apparent reason they saved Princess Leia but then essentially argue the past doesn\u2019t matter.","true":true}
