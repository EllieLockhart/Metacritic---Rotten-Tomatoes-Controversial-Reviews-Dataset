Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely awful movie.  People are so desperate to like this film and want it to be better then the prequels\\, that they blind themselves into not seeing that this is worse than the prequels.","true":true}
