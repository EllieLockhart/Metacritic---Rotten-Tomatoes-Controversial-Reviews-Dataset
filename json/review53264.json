Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Catastrophic. I dont like the last one and i like this one just slightly better. I lost the last bit of respect for the imperium\\, when that oh-so-great pilot succeeded with his stuck on the phone act. When the soccer robot \\\"repaired\\\" the weapon system of his x wing by smashing its head against that circuit board i was ready to leave the cinema. You can say what you want about the old trilogy\\, at least the funny oneliners were not the first and foremost priority. It took itself seriously\\, even though it was a fairy tale\/fantasy\/science fiction mix. And it worked just because of that.\\nIn this flick\\, there are plotholes big enough for several star destroyers\\, an entire story arc which was obsolete and the whole thing just feels\\, like the people who made it never watched star wars before. Rey is Mary Sou\\, period. She doesnt need training\\, being Jedi is apparently very easy. Finn almost had a moment worth remembering\\, but that got taken away by that technician (who suddenly also was a pilot (?!))\\, only for her to tell him\\, that love wins wars. I cant even recall her name and it was only a few days ago\\, that i watched this movie. The characters are just that forgettable and its not because of bad acting.\\nOh\\, and there are continuity problems en masse\\, but that hardly mattered at the time the credits rolled.\\nMark Hamill was great\\, even though he did not play luke skywalker\\, just someone with the same name. I had hoped the trilogy would be more like \\\"rogue one\\\"\\, gritty and dark. In this the story is all over the place\\, everyone can tell a joke or two and in the end the good guys win\\, no doubt about that. All in all i am very very disappointed.","true":true}
