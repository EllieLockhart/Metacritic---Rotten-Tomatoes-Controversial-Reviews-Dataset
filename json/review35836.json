Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is one Wild ride which serves to dash all expectations and take risks. The movie is bogged down by a few errors in an otherwise gorgeous film. During the entirety of the second half of the film It was a nonstop ride throwing viewers onto the edge of their seats. I am adding an extra star for a particularly gorgeous scene that I never seen before in film let alone a Star Wars film.","true":true}
