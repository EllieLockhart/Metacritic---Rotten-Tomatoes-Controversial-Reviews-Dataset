Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw it yesterday. Perhaps a few more bits played for laughs than I would have expected\\, but there was always plenty in the original trilogy (Think of most of Han's dialogue!). This seemed absolutely classic Star Wars\\, and as such I LOVED it!","true":true}
