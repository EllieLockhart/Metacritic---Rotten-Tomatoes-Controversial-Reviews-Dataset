Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian was invited to help with some gardening at a botanical gardens\\, but instead of helping out he just burnt it down and said \\\"hey\\, look at the pretty sparks and explosions! it is even better! Now different plants will grow here!\\\". \\nIf you disagree with him that it is the best garden ever you must just be a grumpy old git who needs to burn with the garden because you just don't 'get it'","true":true}
