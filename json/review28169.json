Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor execution. ADHD film style turns this into an awkward summer action flick. Fans of Star Wars will be asking \\\"what happened to the heroes I love?\\\" and \\\"why are all the rules of the force being broken\/changed and why is there no explaination of what is going on?\\\"\\nThis is as spoiler free of ab explaination as I can give. This movie was majorly disappointing.","true":true}
