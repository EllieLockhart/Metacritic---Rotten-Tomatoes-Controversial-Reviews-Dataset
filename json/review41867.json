Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is the was such a disappointment. New characters that made felt ungenuine with a flat story. It was everything that fans of the frenchise laugh about what happens to films once taken over by Disney. I would wait for this to come out for free on Netflix to use as background noise it's entirely killed what starwars was for me as a fan.","true":true}
