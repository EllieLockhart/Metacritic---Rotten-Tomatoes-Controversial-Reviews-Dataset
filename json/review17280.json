Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this and had been looking forward to it for months but my God! What a pile of pure unadulterated shite! A couple of times I thought of walking out before it had finished and my wife (who is also a massive Star Wars fan) nearly fell asleep a couple of times. I posted what I thought on FB and saw a strong split between those of us who saw the original trilogy in the cinema in the 70s and 80 and those who think this is rubbish and those who are under 20 who think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.\\n\\nFor me the most pathetic parts were (as written loads of times before) Leia 'flying' through space?! Really?! WTF! Res being a fully trained Jedi after 2 days\\, Luke giving up completely. But the biggest thing for me was 'we're running low on fuel'. Really? What\\, are you telling me that there is some fucking huge interstellar BP\\, Shell or Exxon garage somewhere where they fill up\\, eh? Jesus f--king Christ! Give me strength! So many other plot devices and shit in this film that I'd like to go into but can't be bothered. Won't be seeing 9 in the cinema. Thanks a million to the Director for pissing over what should have been a good film.","true":true}
