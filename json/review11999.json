Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved it. I think it was a really cool new take on the force\\, lightsaber action\\, and it has some of the best performances from Luke and Leia. I'm really looking forward to Rian Johnson's new trilogy after this main saga ends.","true":true}
