Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not really a Star Wars movie. Disney has created a movie here that will generate a profit and lead the box office for a week or 2 but it is not made for Star Wars fans it\u2019s made for Disney fans who enjoy action movies with lots of bad jokes and a little bit of plot. Star Wars movies are supposed to be more tactful than that\\, they can be comedic and full of action in there own way but don\u2019t need to use any and every moment as a poor excuse to make a joke. I\u2019ll give this movie 2 stars because I enjoyed watching about half of it for the childish humor but it felt like and endless battery of terrible cliches that in the end just disappointed me.","true":true}
