Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the movie that ended my passion for Star Wars. Disney has ruined something that has captivated my attention for around two decades now. Between the movies and scores of Star Wars books\\,that passion is now destroyed by this awful attempt to produce a coherent story. \\n\\nThe movie was essentially a mash of elements from episode 4\\, 5 & 6 of the Star Wars saga. \\n\\nHonestly\\, they should have just kept everything from the books Cannon and brought new actors into the fold\\, because as it is\\, it destroyed everything. They dare to make the books not Cannon anymore and then still use elements from the books? \\n\\nFUCK THAT!\\n\\nStraight up\\, almost walked out when Luke was fighting Kylo-Ren just because I thought he was all of sudden immortal. Only to realize he was using a force projection\\, (which if you didn't read the books\\, no one who watches the movies would ever know what the fuck that is) but once he became apart of the force\\, that's what made me walk the fuck out.\\n\\nYou straight up ruin a bad ass character like Luke\\, then you get rid of him. \\nSure\\, he could come back as Force ghost type deal\\, but what the fuck was the point of even putting him in the film then?!\\n\\nRUINED. MY LOVE FOR STAR WARS IS RUINED! \\n\\nIt only gets some stars because at least the quality and scenes were at the very least semi entertaining\\, but for everything else about these new Star Wars movies\\, they done fucked up and need to relaunch the series entirely at this point to save it.","true":true}
