{"101487":132891,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2020-04-05","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you want to know why this movie is bad\\, go on YouTube and watch the long analyses people all over this planet have put out. This movie was filled to the brim with character assassinations\\, terrible choreography\\, and no knowledge of the Star Wars lore. It\u2019s an awful movie. Why did the critics love it? Was it because it SUBVERTED expectations? Well\\, yeah\\, my expectations were completely diverted when people did things completely out of character. You would think that Luke\u2019s lightsaber (Anakin\u2019s lightsaber) would mean something to him\\, with all the history it\u2019s seen. But he throws it over his shoulder absent-mindedly and calls it a \u201claser sword\u201d... a Jedi\u2019s weapon deserves more respect. I think it\u2019s completely out of character that Luke attacked Kylo in his sleep. LUKE\\, who didn\u2019t give up on his father when everyone else already had. This was like watching a terribly made fanfic where the writer hated Luke for no reason and wanted to make everyone hate him. I did enjoy when Luke faced Kylo\\, but then he DIED. I remember watching this in theaters\\, shocked\\, thinking\\, \u201cDid they just kill Luke?\u201d I didn\u2019t like it when Leia Mary Poppin\u2019ed back to the ship with the force. Everyone described this as \u201cMary Poppins\u201d and they are absolutely correct. I dare you to watch footage of Mary Poppins and compare it to Carrie Poppins in this movie. They\u2019re twins! I think they should\u2019ve killed Leia off right there\\, because Fisher died. It would\u2019ve made sense and would also be heartbreaking\\, along with adding depth to Kylo Ren\\, as he had hesitated. Rey was very perfect in this film\\, which makes her a badly written character. She lifted all those rocks with the force with no issue and was better than Kylo and Luke without any effort. It\u2019s impossible to connect and relate to a character who doesn\u2019t mess up (though Rey is less perfect in TROS\\, I\u2019m talking about how THIS movie is). She\u2019s extremely powerful! And when I say this\\, it\u2019s not because I can\u2019t handle a female Jedi. For example\\, Ahsoka Tano is a character who makes mistakes constantly and everyone can relate to her. Ahsoka is powerful (ex. decapitating four Mandalorians at once\\, surviving a duel with Vader)\\, but her skills feel EARNED because she\u2019d been training her whole life. Rey hasn\u2019t. Finn was a useless addition to this movie. He\u2019s a coward and when he finally decides to sacrifice himself to save everyone\\, Rose swoops in and stops him. I was fine with Rose\u2019s character until that point\\, when she broke into prequel dialogue and said\\, \u201cit\u2019s not about destroying what you hate\\, it\u2019s about saving what you love\u201d and then KISSES HIM. Poe meant nothing to me\\, and Holdo was annoying. Kylo went shirtless for some reason. Snoke died. Ackbar died. Hux existed. The throne room fight looked really cool until you watch it slowly. Go on YouTube and look at an analysis for the fight and you\u2019ll understand. This movie was so bad\\, and I remember during the Canto Bight scene I checked my watch and wondered how much was left and when it would get good like the critics said. It didn\u2019t. This movie looks like a flawless unblemished apple from the outside (the visuals\\, the excitement about how things will be after TFA) but it\u2019s rotten once you break past the skin. ","true":true}
