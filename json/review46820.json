Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well you can clearly see this is becoming a \u201cDisney\u201d franchise! Too many jokes\\, family movie with no storyline. Trying to revive the saga with same old story and characters\\, long and boring","true":true}
