Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! Go and see it with an open mind. I think all the negative reviews are because everyone got an idea in their head of what it should be before it came out. I can't wait for the next movie!","true":true}
