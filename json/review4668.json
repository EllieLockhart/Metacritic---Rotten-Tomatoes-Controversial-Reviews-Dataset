Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete blasphemy and degradation of the whole idea behind Star Wars. Poor character development\\, bad sense of humor\\, disney-like lines and scenes that just dont fit Star Wars universe at all.They literally destroyed everything that the original Star Wars trilogy represented. Luke's character in these movies is turned into a douchebag and all male characters are represented as pussies or morons in contrast of female cast that were empowered and bitchy. Lack of epic scenes\\,seriousness and depth of story. Ridiculous scenes with Leia floating in space and disney casino. Only good thing about the movie is that it looks visually good. Nothing else","true":true}
