Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No need for the type of Comedy in this film\\, unanswered questions that leave you not caring about the characters for the next film anymore\\, and plot holes. Movie goes from starwars what felt like Gravity\\, i Harry Potter\/Narnia references. No reason for Finn's Plot  or even Rose. This Luke Skywalker was not who we wanted  to see\\, feel bad for Mark Hamil\\, First Wars movie that left a bad taste.","true":true}
