Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Neil Druckmann is a beautiful genius...almost...\r\rI understand the controversy\\, I really do\\, but then I was spoiled and expecting the worst. The game design is truly groundbreaking and what I mean by that is the graphics and game play. I was initially the same\\, \\\"the story is ruined\\\"\\, \\\"no not joel!\\\" but you HAVE to play through it all to \\\"get it\\\" my only gripe is the clunky narrative\\, bad pacing and finally...the ending.\r\rThere was really no need for the last fight. You actually end up saving Abby. Should have left it there. Looking back\\, it would have made much more sense to have Ellie actually save Abby\\, even on a kind of \\\"If anyone is going to kill you it's me!\\\" and expand the beautiful California maps and have a whole section where Ellie truly saves her (you can kill Lev\\, don't care about him he can have died on the beach for more \\\"Abby\\\" player sentiment) but to have taken her back to her boat to recover\\, then protect her would have been far better a compelling story\\, and have them even work together to survive. And maybe...just maybe have Abby find remorse (not for killing Joel) for the way she killed him. Then have them go their separate ways.\r\rAlso no need for the damage to the hand ;) it came over as a really nasty cheap gimmick. Again Drukmann drops the ball\\, as she already lost everything. Or at the least make the fight (there really didn't need to be one\\, Abby let Ellie go on 2 separate occasions) an option you can choose\\, and if you choose to fight Abby you CAN kill her. But I think we might be seeing more of Abby and Lev.\r\rHope there's a Part III and I hope they bring back Abby. I actually loved her character (would have liked ND to have fleshed her out a bit more) so Neils magic certainly worked on me...somewhat\\, great job all round\\, story needed to be better\\, more fleshed out characters because I really didn't care about any of them tbh. But even with it's jumbled narrative and cheap gimmick shock (come on Neil you can be better than that) the absence of Bruce Straley is really felt.\r\rI gave the game a fair 5: Only because the story was lacking and the ugly ending I thought was unnecessary. Having Ellie playing that song\\, with her hand intact and THEN leaving the guitar and walking away would have been for a much better ending.\r\rLike I said\\, Neil Druckmann is a beautiful genius...almost.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
