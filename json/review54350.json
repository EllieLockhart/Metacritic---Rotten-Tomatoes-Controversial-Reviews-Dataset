Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never thought about walking out of a Star Wars film before.  This will effect merchandise in the long run.  They need to say this was a nightmare of one of the characters and make a new \\\"the last jedi'.  Luke goes from hero to coward.  The battle scenes are boring.  Other than Rey\\, none of the characters I can connect with.  After seeing every star wars to date in the theaters\\, I will not being going for the next?  Nor will I be buying related merchandize.","true":true}
