Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is fantastic\\, the best movie in the franchise since \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\".  This movie is a \\\"middle\\\" movie\\, one that has to carry the story from the opening chapter (The Force Awakens) to whatever the last film will be.  As such\\, it has to deal with a lot of themes\\, and this movie is the most adult of all.  There is a line in the movie where Yoda says to Skywalker\\, \\\"failure is the best teacher of all\\\"\\, which is something we all learn as we grow up.  And the rebels fail over and over in this movie...it is a tragedy.  The elderly Leia has seen it all before\\, and knows they will learn and come back stronger.  And this film also deals with the fact that we all have a balance of dark and light and sometimes (as Obi Wan Kenobi said way back) who we think is right depends very much on your point of view. The old hand off to the new...great job Disney.  Every one should see this installment.  I predict that in years to come\\, this one will become the most well regarded film in the series.","true":true}
