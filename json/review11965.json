Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Humor was forced and not funny. \\nThe story was poorly written. \\nThe Director\/ Writer - Rian Johnson and Disney have invested more time and money into damage control marketing\/ promoting this underdeveloped movie\\, when they should have invested the time in developing the story.\\n\\nThe theatre experience is depressing; no laughs\\, no oohs and ahhs...and no applause at the end. \\n\\nWait for the digital rental and see for yourself.","true":true}
