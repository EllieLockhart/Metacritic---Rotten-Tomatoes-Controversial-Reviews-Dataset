Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like it. it's got a few predictable moments but it feels like a Star Wars movie and that's all I wanted. I think a lot of people expected way too much for an in-between film. The film is a Spectacle of beautiful shots and the characters have enough growth for me to enjoy it. I don't really see what everyone is complaining about. ","true":true}
