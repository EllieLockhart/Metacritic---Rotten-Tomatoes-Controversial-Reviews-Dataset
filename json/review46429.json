Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasted and unexplained character plots from previous instalment. The movie is essentially just one scene that drags on for 2 and a half hours with unnecessary side stories and highly predictable outcomes. Disney's involvement has granted us with a \\\"let's all be friends\\\" franchise with no true villainous characters.","true":true}
