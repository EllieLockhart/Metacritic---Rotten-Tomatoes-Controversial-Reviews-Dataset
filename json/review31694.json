Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sorry\\, once again this is not the universe of Lucas.\\nThe movie is just a collection of action and sci-fi scenes with little meaning.\\nThe last ship\\, the last rebels\\, the last bomb...\\nAn important character like Snoke is obliterated in one rush.","true":true}
