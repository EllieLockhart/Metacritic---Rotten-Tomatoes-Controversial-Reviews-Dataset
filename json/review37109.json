Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only good thing about this movie is the visuals. The story has a lot of plot holes (YouTube has hundreds of videos of this)\\, disconnects from the established lore (force ghosts using lightning and NO training required to do everything a Jedi master does)\\, no character development for Rey\\, Finn or Poe\\, oddly placed jokes ( the beginning scene with Poe and Hux looks like it was taken from SpaceBalls)\\, politics injected everywhere around the movie in a place where one goes to get away from all that stuff. Useless Canto Bight side plot. And the worst part is the character assassination of the greatest hero Luke Skywalker. It's obvious this movie was a first draft written by people with a SJW agenda who don't know much about Star Wars nor sci-fi\/action movies.","true":true}
