Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only half way through Star Wars: The Last Jedi and it has to be one of the worst executed\\, worst directed and worst storylines I've seen and I've not finished the movie yet! Did they take a lorry full of drugs when they thought this piece crap up... This movie literally has took a dump of franchise from the action scenes to the crude feminist agenda which is so blatant and misplaced. Can Hollywood not make any good films anymore that the fans can appreciate\\, this \\\"movie\\\" needs erasing from history and to never be spoken off again.AND yes I will watch to the end cursing the arseholes responsible for making this technically cannon in the rich Star Wars story.","true":true}
