Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most of the criticisms of this film are things already present in the franchise or have to due with over-exposure\/over-hyping. People didn't keep their expectations in check and when a genuinely new and interesting take on this universe came out instead of a sterile unimaginative hackjob like The Force Awakens that audiences guffawed at and threw their money at\\, it got reception like this. Snoke was a dumb one-note villain and there was literally no reason he would have turned into a fuckin' Roman poet and started telling Rey\/Kylo his past as DARTH PLAGEIUS THE WISE\\, which\\, given that the dude has a huge LIGHTSABER-SHAPED GASH in his forehead\\, seems like a good indication we haven't seen the last of him. Takes a lot of influence from other pulpy material like Kagemusha and Ikiru by Kurosawa or the Bridge on the River Kwai to spice things up\\, like how the original derived a lot of inspiration from pulp and pop culture as well\\, and gets back to the zeitgest of what Star Wars is about rather than rehashing shit we've seen a million times before in this ridiculously over-exposed franchise. As someone who hated FA\\, and is pretty tired of the same old shit in Star Wars\\, this made me happy and excited to see where the franchise can go next; unfortunately\\, JJ is coming back to direct the next one\\, so I'm sure we'll be back to the same old nostalgiabaiting he excels at.","true":true}
