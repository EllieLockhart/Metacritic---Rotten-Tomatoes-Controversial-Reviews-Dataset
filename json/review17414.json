Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw \\\"The Last Hope\\\" in theaters as a 7yr old. \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is the closest the franchise has come to matching the feeling I had watching Star Wars for the 1st time...\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is a close 2nd to #IV as the best in the series...planning on seeing it again this weekend.","true":true}
