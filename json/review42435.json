Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a disaster. It was some of the worst writting I've ever seen. People in the theater were laughing at how stupid some of the scenes were. This is easily one of the worst Star Wars films of all time. What a joke..","true":true}
