Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes are just too much to handle. Anyone that is not white literally has no effect on the plot at all. And now that we can just kamikaze a ship in space it seems stupid to build a ship bigger than one person. The salt races r just stupid. Disney needs to remake this movie and actually use the most powerful force users to ever exist. Thanks for making Snoke and Luke completely worthless in the plot. By far the worst director\\, I will go out of my way to not see a movie from this guy.","true":true}
