Got all but Mike and Matt killed.\r\rJumped around using Episode option to collect clues and totems I missed and to see different outcomes of choices.\r\rThen the third time I wrote over the previous game and played through making my own choices so those would be saved.\r\rAmazing how detailed the graphics were.  The story line is classic horror film with nods to Friday\\, Nightmare\\, Bloody Valentine\\, Saw\\, Psycho\\, and many more!  And the them song\\, O'Death fits it so well and really spoils it if you pay attention to the lyrics.\r\rThe twists are good\\, and really you have two separate horror films in one game.  The first half I could totally see as a Hollywood movie(Small budget type ala Paranormal and first couple of Saws)\r\rSeriously\\, if you want a game that focuses on story telling and love horror movies\\, this game is for you!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
