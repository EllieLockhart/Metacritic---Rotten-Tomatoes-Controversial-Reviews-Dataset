Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers in this!\\nSaw this movie in theater with the family about a week or two after it came out. Sorry to say this movie was just a bad version of Empire Strikes Back. the last stand in the mine was stupid and filled with mistakes and bad choices. Why did they defend from outside\\, Why did everything break off and go after the MF\\, why and how did someone who followed the order to retreat able to do a 180 and a left turn to tackle Someone out of the way. most scenes had some point were you are like why would you do that. how did they get there.","true":true}
