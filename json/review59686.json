The mechanics of game play are awesome\\, the upgraded crafted is great. There are so many new tools at your disposal I love it.

The lgbtq community exists. Time to get over it. I think it\u2019s awesome that there is representation for lgbtq folks in this game. The literal only thing I didn\u2019t like what the listen mode didn\u2019t work as well as the last game\\, and that\u2019s only because I didn\u2019t realize I could upgrade it until pretty much the very end. So that\u2019s definitely on me. Overall\\, absolutely amazing game\\, and anyone who says otherwise is probably just an **** or a baby who didn\u2019t even finish the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
