Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cringed in my seat numerous times while watching this movie. I felt like I was watching Spaceballs 2. Rian Johnson's version of Star Wars was embarrassing! I'm a huge star wars fan and I like the Force Awakens but This was terrible.","true":true}
