Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Storyline inconsistencies\\, crudely flat character development\\, uncomfortable comedic atmospheres and improper direction laid out for the next movie. The Force Awakens gave this movie a strong direction to move from\\, yet Rian Johnson feels as though his main priority was to strip everything built up from the Force Awakens and attempt to give a new layout that leaves the trilogy completely a mess and garbled which renders anticipation for Episode IX severely low. There were a few good moments as all low end Star Wars movies tend to have. The cinematography was strong in most instances yet other moments felt out of place. Some plot moments gave a wonderful 'edge of the seat' feeling and a few scenes even gave decent tone and buildup. But alas\\, the movie as a whole\\, falls incredibly flat and as the 2nd movie set in an intentional trilogy\\, it completely disregards the dynamics of storyline buildup and properly fluidity\\, ie No Flow. Hopefully JJ coming back for Episode IX brings back that fluidity. ","true":true}
