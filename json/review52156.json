Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the movie finished I had a smile on my face it was a good movie\\, great sound\\, great visuals. The thing that made me question things was more lore wise\\, it just appeared that there was no real stories answered. Snoke character was a let down\\, Finn and Rose were not so interesting in this movie\\, Princess Leia though had some good scenes there was one scene that was a bit cringy.\\nLuke even though Mark Hammil was fantastic as always I think his character was let down and would of prefered Mark's take on Luke.\\n\\nRey and Kylo were fantastic\\, enjoyed their characters very much only let down for me was Rey's parents. Also some other things like physics lol. \\n\\nAll in all it was an enjoyable movie but does leave you with some questions to why more background story was not given to characters.","true":true}
