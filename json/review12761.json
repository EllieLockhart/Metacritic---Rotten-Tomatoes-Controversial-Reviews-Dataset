{"101487":130335,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created this account just to voice my frustration with this movie. I've heard a lot of men complain about this movie being too progressive\\, and all I can say is as much as I wish it was\\, it's not even that. It's just terrible.\\n\\nForce Awakens and Rogue One were such amazing additions to Star Wars\\, I have no idea how the Last Jedi went so wrong.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens and Rogue One promised us a new generation of Star Wars. A new fandom where diversity was welcomed and anyone could be a Star Wars fan. But this movie threw all of that out and reminded us that this universe does not care about its fans and is willing to pay diversity a lip service as long as it means a quick buck.\\n\\nDaisy Ridley deserved a better movie. I don't blame her for wanting to be done with Star Wars after episode IX. Gone is Rey's Cambpell-esque heroic journey\\, replaced by a plot that has nearly all of her actions revolving around the actions of other characters\\, not to mention the incredibly toxic shipping pair that is Reylo. She is no longer the main character of her own trilogy. And as if that wasn't bad enough\\, one of her best scenes where she has actual agency ends up getting cut from the final movie.\\n\\nGone is Finn's emotional growth from Force Awakens\\, instead he was treated off-handedly and with little care. Rian Johnson even joked about keeping Finn in a coma for the entirety of the movie. Not only that but his side-plot introduced Rose as a potential candidate for a love triangle that is handled both clumsily and inappropriately. And for all of the chemistry that the first movie developed between Rey and Finn\\, and the apparent friendship that Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have shared\\, this movie has one scene. One. Where the two are reunited (it lasts a minute and they hug). There isn't even a scene of closure at the end between the two of them. They don't even get a chance to hold a single conversation.\\n\\nAs for Holdo\\, while I liked her character a lot\\, Poe's character assassination should not have been the price to pay for her addition to the movie. This is a fictional world. If the director wanted to show what toxic masculinity looks like he could have done so using the Resistance's heirarchy of command\\, or a chauvinist captain\\, there's no limit to how many new characters he can create. But instead he completely changes everything we know about Poe (both from the first movie\\, and the comic series) and continues to enforce a stereotype that does little to help anyone that could relate to Poe from the first movie\\, or Latinos in general.\\n\\nNot to mention Rose's under-utilization and strangely hypocritical behavior at the end\\, the plot holes\\, the pacing issues\\, the abandoned plot threads from Episode VII. And don't even get me started on Captain Phasma. We were promised by Lucasfilm\\, both on the marketing tour\\, the comics\\, the Phasma novelization\\, and in interviews that Captain Phasma would be coming back. Instead she's in all of 5 minutes or so\\, and then gets \\\"killed.\\\" Even her deleted cutscene has her being killed.\\n\\nFinally\\, as a side-note. There are plenty of quotes and interviews were Daisy Ridley\\, and especially Mark Hamil and other actors have expressed frustration and confusion over their roles and the direction of the plot. But none of their concerns were ever addressed\\, instead they had to follow the \\\"vision\\\" of their \\\"auteur\\\" director Rian Johnson. Was it the movie Rian Johnson wanted to make? Undoubtedly. Is it a good movie? questionable. Is it a proper sequal to the Force Awakens? Absolutely not. \\nIs it feminist?\\n\\nHaha. Not even close. We now have a movie that has killed off (Holdo\\, Phasma)\\, written off (Rose)\\, has to write off (Leia) or relegated to cameo status (Maz) every single woman in the movie other than Rey\\, while Kylo\\, Hux\\, Poe\\, and Finn get to continue the story. And as for Rey\\, well the Last Jedi has made it abundently clear that this is no longer her story\\, it's Kylo's. Unless we want to go down the incredibly toxic journey that is Reylo. I want to say we won't\\, but Rian Johnson's quote regarding the scene where Rey and Kylo force touch as \\\"the closest thing we'll get to a sex scene in a Star Wars movie\\\" does not leave me feeling confident.\\n\\nI became a die-hard Star Wars fan with the Force Awakens\\, and loved Rogue One\\, but with the Last Jedi Lucasfilm has almost killed Star Wars for me.","true":true}
