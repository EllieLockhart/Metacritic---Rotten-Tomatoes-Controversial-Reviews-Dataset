Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back - even with Canto Bite. Wonderful storytelling\\, visually stunning\\, great acting and chemistry\\, perfect casting\\, a bold star wars that is not made to please fans. One of those movies you can watch again and again and every time find a new perspective. And as always\\, the fantastic music score of John Williams never disappoints.","true":true}
