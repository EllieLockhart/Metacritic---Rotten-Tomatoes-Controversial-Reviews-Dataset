Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie! Saw it with my 7 year old daughter and she loved it. Seeing it through her eyes really helped me understand what they have got right. The plot holes etc all really don't matter\\, it's entertainment. This is not a movie only for star wars fans and its better for it.","true":true}
