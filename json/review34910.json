Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film has very little imagination when we counted the plot parallel to that of Luke and Rey\\, we all expected much more\\, like seeing the Knights of Ren or the Origin Snoke\\, things that could be rescued from episode 7 instead of showing us to Rosue and Finn that we are not interested \\, on the other hand Luke and Rey\\, Luke is a coward and never leaves the island\\, does not have the courage to train Rey and confront Kylo and ultimately show it as a projection or illusion that dodges three swords Kylo and ends \\, disappears and ascends\\, the film is very long and tiring\\, Rey is a Jedi at the same level of Kylo without any training\\, jokes that make people look ridiculous\\, an ending that could have been better exploiting for example: Luke having a saber fight Memorable lasers against Kylo\\, because as Luke in the end dies or ascends never again will be in action\\, a lot of unforgivable things","true":true}
