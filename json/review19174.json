Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it's just too too long.\\nIt was better than The Force Awakens but it also worked too hard to not be Force Awakens. It's plot was bizare and filled with a lot of questions and strange motivations. There were a lot of questions left unanswered from the last movie and new ones that were also not answered.","true":true}
