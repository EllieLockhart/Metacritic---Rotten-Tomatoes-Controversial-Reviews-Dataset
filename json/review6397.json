Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney sacrificed the cohesion of the Star Wars universe to meet a corporate strategic objective: brand durability. Plot arcs that are immaterial to story resolution; a non-nonsensical\\, emasculated Luke Skywalker; a forced\\, social justice agenda; unsatisfying resolutions to story arc mysteries; the needless early killing of an interesting super villain; new\\, unanchored force powers\\, such as the deadly force-skyping; and the mistreatment of Carrie Fisher's last appearance in a movie are but some of the flaws in this movie. The Last Jedi is visually stunning hot garbage. It's the worst Star Wars movie by a wide margin.","true":true}
