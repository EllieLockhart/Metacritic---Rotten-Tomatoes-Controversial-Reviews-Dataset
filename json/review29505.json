Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is the director we\u2019ve been looking for! The Skywalker saga is 40 years old and it\u2019s time for it to end. Bring on new directions! If not for the lengthy\\, clumsy subplot diversion\\, it would be a five-star film.","true":true}
