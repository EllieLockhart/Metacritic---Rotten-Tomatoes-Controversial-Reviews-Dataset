Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good movie\\, but it didn't answer questions fans had. It didn't go the direction that many felt it should.\\n\\nI was over all a little disappointed in it\\, however as a movie\\, I think it was good. \\n\\nHonestly though\\, life never turns out how you expect\\, so why would StarWars? I mean it was different\\, it didn't follow the same old story. It wasn't a re-telling\\, it was something different. \\n\\nI was disappointed\\, but not mad. I am more intrigued as to what they could possibly do with it now.\\n\\nYes\\, I want to watch it again.","true":true}
