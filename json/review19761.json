Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was an entertaining movie. But the story is definitely not great. There was a lot of potential to develop characters and the plot but it failed. Also the bits of comedy seemed forced (no pun intended)","true":true}
