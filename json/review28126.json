Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pointless villain\\, Jedi magically becomes a master instantly\\, we get a female general and she's an utter failure of a leader\\, and a suddenly infatuated lover who would condemn her own people to severe peril than let someone she's hardly acquainted with attempt a desperate act to save them.
