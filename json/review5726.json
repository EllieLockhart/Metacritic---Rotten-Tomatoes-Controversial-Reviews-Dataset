Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Different\\, not bad. Last Jedi plays with the star wars mold in many ways\\, which some will find problematic. Without spoiling\\, things will likely not go in the way you expected them. In some ways its disappointing\\, but in others it is interesting to see the writers break with established ideas and played out tropes. Will you like it? That depends on what you're looking for in a star wars movie. \\n\\nI will say that despite my liking of the film\\, it is not without faults. One arc\\, while entertaining\\, does go on for a bit too long\\, and there are several climatic moments that each feel like they could have been the climax. Much like Empire Strikes Back\\, the pacing and structure are very different than a  typical film\\, but it doesn't quite do as well as Empire did. Some characters are not used to their best extent as well. However despite betraying most if not all expectations\\, the films  comes to a satisfying conclusion and opens up the story for a very interesting last film.","true":true}
