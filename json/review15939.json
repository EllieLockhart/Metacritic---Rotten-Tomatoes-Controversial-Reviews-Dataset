{"101487":136178,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-23","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a 39 year old life long Star Wars fan. I've seen every movie in the series many many times: prequels\\, original cuts\\, and the re-releases. I've read countless extended universe books (they should have just done the Thrawn Trilogy!) I've likely played every officially licensed Star Wars game (RGP\\, board\/miniature game\\, video game\\, etc.). I am deeply knowledgeable of the lore that makes the series truly great. Star Wars was a huge part of my childhood\\, and it is something which even as an adult with three children is still a big deal for me. I've now watched TLJ several times and I'm ready to share my insights on this highly polarizing episode. \\n\\n[SPOILERS AHEAD!]\\n\\nLet me start by saying Rian Johnson should NEVER be allowed to write a single line for another Star Wars movie\\, much less do a whole new trilogy of movies. How does someone with such a poor resume get the execs at Disney to let them even ATTEMPT to take on this challenge? What kind of pitch could someone give to write AND direct such important and valuable IP when they essentially have the equivalent experience of writing two episodes of LA Law\\, directing Deathstalker V\\, and a doing poorly received arthouse flick? He must have some profound connections\\, or a whole lot of dirt on someone. His prime directive appears to be this: destroy everything sacred in the Star Wars universe\\, make TFA entirely pointless\\, and raise two middle fingers to everyone who doesn't like it. Some sick combination of jealousy and narcissism apparently made him want to set J.J. Abrams up for failure: Episode IX is the movie that is going to see the HUGE box office drop due to the pointless fan slapping done in this film. TFA was great\\, the buzz for the next installment was unbelievable. The Internet was wild with rumors and theories and hope for the next installment. Many people (myself included) bought tickets for TLJ months in advance... which meant sold out theaters and a huge opening weekend no matter what. Rian knew he could do whatever he wanted and still walk away claiming it was a big success based on that data alone. Well\\, the capital built in TFA is now wasted after TLJ. Episode IX will not be seeing the same fan surge this film undeservedly received.\\n\\nBig Issues: \\n\\n- Snoke: Who the hell \\\"was\\\" he? How did he get this job? Was he just the most scarred dude around? Did he simply have the most fascist followers on Space Twitter? Why have him in the films in the first place if you cannot even justify his purpose? A few lines of dialog were _all it took_ to make sense out of this. Ignoring character exposition with the excuse that Lucas didn't explain the Emperor until the prequels is bogus. We saw the prequels to these films... all SIX OF THEM. He didn't just poof into existence and rule the galaxy. Give me a break man! All that time hoping his projected image from TFA was a Wizard of Oz created by a dark and twisted Jar-Jar Binks. Oh well... Snoke is gone now and seemed to have no point whatsoever.\\n\\n- Knights Of Ren: Where are they? Are they also pointless now? Is whiny Emo Ren the only Sith left on the board? \\n\\n- Superman Leia?! WTF was that... I kept waiting for Poe to quote that terrible dialog from the cringeworthy Matrix sequel.\\n\\n- Luke... good lord\\, I don't know where to even begin. Let's just say ROTJ and even TFA didn't leave me thinking I was going to see my hero become a washed up loser drinking milk from some space walrus' tit. Also\\, the portrayal of this character was an entirely pointless slap in the face of every fan of the original trilogy. Rian could have got the same meta story across without being such a jackass. This is just Rian Johnson giving us the finger and laughing.\\n\\n- Kylo Ren: This guy has burned the Jedi Academy to the ground\\, murdered his own family\\, killed his Sith master\\, and assumed control of the First Order. Yet somehow he is still a whiny little b*tch. Please give me a worthy antagonist which isn't a sad little emo man-child. PLEASE! \\n\\nThe Non-Issues:\\n\\nA number of user reviews seem to be seething with political nonsense. I totally understand that 2017 is beginning of some kind of \\\"age of outrage\\\". The US is fuming with extremists on each side\\, who are pissing off everyone else across the political spectrum on a daily (if not hourly) basis. I am confident that all the dog-whistles people are perceiving are more a projection of how they see the world (and see those who oppose whatever their views are) in light of all the heightened polarization today. Criticism that this movie is anti-men\\, because of the (absolutely amazing!) female leads is totally disgusting. You could level the same criticism at A Nightmare On Elm Street 3. How about \\\"all rich people are evil\\\" - go watch Toxic Avenger through that lens and get your mind blown. Carefully hidden PETA-like messaging triggering you? Don't even think of watching The Secret of NIMH again. Ruining your childhood much? Just enjoy the damn movie and don't get hung up looking for political things. If you look hard enough you'll find hidden messages everywhere\\, and never be able to enjoy anything.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\nAll that said\\, there are some big picture ideas and frameworks (which likely pre-date Rian's involvement) and do in a meta-sense make this a not-so-terrible (possibly even pretty decent) film.\\n\\nThe future of the Force and the meaning of this awakening is cemented in this film. Much of the back and forth with Kylo and Rey touch on an odd idea. Could the Force be beyond good and evil \/ light and dark. Did Skywalker bloodline bring \\\"balance to the force\\\"... by destroying the Jedi Order AND The Sith? Not a balance of light vs. dark\\, but a new balance of light and dark into one? We watch as the old established orders meet their end. The orthodox religion of the force dies with Luke in the shadow of the first Jedi temple. A new religion\\, understanding\\, being-ness of the Force is about to take hold on the galaxy.\\n\\nFailure itself is a huge message in this film. Every sub plot in the film totally failed\\, and did so _intentionally_ to drive the message home that failure is a greater teacher then success. That the true legacy of the Jedi\\, Sith\\, Empire\\, and Rebels was failure after failure to bring peace and\/or order to the galaxy. Something has to change\\, and I think we are seeing hints of that in this film.  \\n\\nThe final scene was epic. I certainly have friends who disagree\\, but the passing of the torch to a new generation without the orthodoxy\\, rigor\\, and establishment of the previous Jedi Order is a big deal. This is a new religion of the Force being written -- one without books and teachers. One which has to be experienced and developed by new chosen disciples. I was one of those fans who really hated how the prequels moved the Force from being a tremendous supernatural Zen\/Tao-like power flowing through all things and open to anyone... to being a product of microscopic intelligent parasites living in the blood of a chosen few. Midi-chlorian blood tests be damned\\, I want the Force to be a mystical energy once again. I hope this \\\"awakening\\\" now means everyone may be able to tap into the Force without being born into it with the right bloodline\\, or just by having a nasty parasite infection. It appears that may be the case as the Force itself is reaching out and mystically choosing a new legion of force users to replace the old generation. Speculation maybe\\, but I have hope.\\n\\nIncredible visuals\\, a beautiful score\\, and great art direction help pull this movie out of splatty tomato territory in my book. Even if it doesn't feel Star Wars-y enough for my tastes this time around\\, and suffered from some slow pacing\\, it did what it needed to do in order to take us to the next step on this journey. I'm excited and hopeful for the conclusion to this arc\\, and what it means for the franchise. Rian certainly did his best to burn it all down\\, but he can't kill Star Wars so easily. Hopefully\\, Disney will listen to the millions of die-hard fans and take better care with the next installment(s).","true":true}
