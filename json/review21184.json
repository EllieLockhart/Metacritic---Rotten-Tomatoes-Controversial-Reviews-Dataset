Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched a few older movies tonight and thinking of this Last Jedi makes me mad how bad this is\\, the fake camaraderie between Poe Dameron and the black guy\\, when re-watching it tonight I'm back to again lower my score","true":true}
