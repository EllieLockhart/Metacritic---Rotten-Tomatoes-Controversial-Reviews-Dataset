Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having seen a pre-screening last night\\, I had high hopes for this film. I can appreciate the effort put in for a spectacle of this size\\, but it falls flatly\\, and hard for that matter. I left the theater conflicted because if some real bizarro moments in the film like: Fans-\\\" Who is Snoke?\\\" TLJ-Not gonna tell you! Fans-\\\"Who are Rey's parents?\\\" TLJ-Haha! Nope again! Fans-\\\"Am I watching an episode of 'Whale Wars' with galactic arms distance traveling through space?\\\" TLJ-\\\"Maybe!\\\"","true":true}
