Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Far too many moments meant to pander to younger audiences and some dialog feels like a high school freshman wrote the screenplay. There is not much \\\"show don't tell\\\" in this movie and it holds the audience's hand for the entire duration. For the less technical viewer\\, the action sequences are choreographed well enough to enjoy and there are some genuinely beautiful shots in the film. In time this will surely be one of the worst Star Wars movies to date.","true":true}
