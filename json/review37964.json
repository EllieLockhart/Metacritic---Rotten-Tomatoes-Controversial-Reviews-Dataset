Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The show was not bad but was a disappointment for sure.  Luke did not even have the same personality.  The force was changed and someone became a Jedi over night.  Worst of the star wars series.","true":true}
