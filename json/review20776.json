Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie. I did find it entertaining. But the plot holes are too big\\, and the character of Luke is too betrayed for me to approve. I think Mark Hamill\\, who I deeply respect\\, realizes Luke should've been written differently. Unfortunately\\, his opinion didn't influence the script. Four characters need justification in episode 9: Finn and Rose (what have they done to help the Alliance when they just about effectively obliterated it?)\\, Leia (why keep her alive aside from some witty comments and connection with Luke?)\\, and Snoke (was his death an illusion\\, and either way what is his backstory?)","true":true}
