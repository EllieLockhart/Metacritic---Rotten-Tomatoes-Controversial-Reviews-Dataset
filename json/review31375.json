Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Somehow the first order is Controlling the galaxy not explained why. Luke is treated like dirt by the makers of this movie\\, ITS SO STUPID! Luke didn't grow into that kind of character from the old trilogy. Luke is supposed to be \\nthe most powerful Jedi of all time and his power was not utilized or really shown. The guy has taken on armies in the comics and  it's stupid how they underpowered him. What they do with Luke in the end is the worst thing they could have done.\\n\\nThe movie tries to be funny but it isn't I didnt laugh once.  It's a stupid disgrace to all the Star Wars films and easily the worst.","true":true}
