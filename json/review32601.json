Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi is a hell of a movie with enjoyable twists and turns that will genuinely surprise you. I loved this movie and it definitely gave more character development to many of the characters from the previous movie The Force Awakens. There are maybe two or three scenes I had problems with that made me a little worried during the first act of the movie\\, but those scenes were subsided by the awesome plot that was brought with the second and third acts of the movie.","true":true}
