Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aight\\, the movie was lacking the punch that the original Star Wars films had. By throwing useless plot points at you that take up 1\/4th of the movie along with technology still being the same after some 50 years this film is lacking for it's critical acclaim.","true":true}
