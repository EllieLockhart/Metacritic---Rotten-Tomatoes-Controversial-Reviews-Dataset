We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The reason that I am giving this a rating of 5\/10\\, is because of the story alone. I really enjoyed the game play and the graphics though. Coming from The Last Of Us\\, we were not expecting a Part 2\\, but here we are 7 years later and oh my god. So as I stated\\, the story is not very good. I know where they were trying to go\\, but they went about it the wrong way. Not only did they kill off a beloved character (one of the MAIN characters may I add) they didn't even have Ellie kill Abbey. As well as having us play as the killer of JOEL! And they try to make you feel sorry for her! Naughty dog even MISLEAD all the fans of the game by inserting Joel into roles that HE IS NOT IN! Now\\, I understood about the whole \\\"ending the cycle\\\" of non-stop killing. When you read these reviews on websites about the whole \\\"these people are homophobic or they are incels\\\" and the list goes on. NO! This is not the case for everyone. I have played the ENTIRE game through and i had no issue with LGBT. Most people are negative bombing the game without playing it\\, and just solely giving reviews on the leaks they see\\, or  they are just agreeing with people who have a bigger following. I actually applaud naughty dog for doing this\\, BUT DO NOT call the people who don't like the game homophobic\\, trans-phobic\\, incels and etc. It just shows how immature these sites are.\r\rSo all in all\\, It isn't a bad game. Bad story? YES. Good graphics? YES. But we are not allowed to hate the games story without the name calling. It has to stop!\r\rThank you and have a nice day!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
