Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun movie.  Significant logic flaws.  Biggest problem: the movie is a long commercial of toys yet to come.  The length of the movie and the characters (or participants) in the movie are often there for commercial purposes.  Disney still doesn't know how to make an adult movie\\, and they want to make their money back on the purchase from Lucas ASAP.","true":true}
