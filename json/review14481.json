Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this film. The Force Awakens was very good so now I feel cheated.\\nThe new actors are not nesccessary and at the story is boring.\\n\\nAlso\\, this movie is failing in China. \\nI heard that Hollywood really think a Vietnam-American girl into the film (Rose) will make China people buy tickets??\\nBut we don't care about 'diversity ideology' in China. That is an American idea. \\nTitanic\\, Avatar and Lord of the Rings only have Westerners actors but they were a huge success in China.","true":true}
