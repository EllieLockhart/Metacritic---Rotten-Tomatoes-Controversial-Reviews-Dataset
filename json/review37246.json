Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The past 2 were great movies . This was a very weak attempt. More of a women power type theme. The men were just trigger happy dummies and the women were all knowing save the day throughout. Cheesy weak humour at times and new characters that meant nothing. It has some good moments but it generally did not sit well with me.","true":true}
