Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A broken film that has set ups with out pay offs and pay offs without set ups. Wouldn't recommend this as a Star Wars Fan. It would of been better as a Empire Strikes Back rip off which the prior film (Force Awakens) was a rip off of a new hope.","true":true}
