Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great action and great visuals!! The story was week and made Luke look like a wimp and lea pulled a Mary Poppins act.... Story improvements - Luke should have just been there to fight kylo... die in a memorable battle\\, wouldve pushed kylo to look more powerful w the darkside. -Lea should've been the one to light speed into them\\, not the purple chic idk who she even is - the resistance appeared so killed off they fit into the millennium falcon -Snoke who?","true":true}
