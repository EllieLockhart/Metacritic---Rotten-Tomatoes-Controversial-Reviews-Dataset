Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a boring movie. I was constantly checking my watch. The film is too long\\, makes little logical sense\\, ignores Star Wars lore\\, and has many \\\"twists\\\" that feel lazy. Honestly\\, this is one of the most lazily written films I've ever seen. I was deeply upset I spent money on theater tickets. I will not be seeing another Star Wars film unless it is free to stream\\, and even though I probably won't because those are 2+ hours I can never get back.  \\n\\nTo make matters worse\\, this movie is inappropriate for children due to its dark and frankly incoherent plot. I'm sincerely confused who the target audience was. Clearly not me. Clearly not children.","true":true}
