Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has an embarassing number of plot holes... Goes against what Luke is as a character in Star Wars.... injects some kind of political narrative in it that lead NOWHERE... and features worse action scenes than the Phantom Menace.... This is a dogshit Script that was given a 300 million dollar budget.... This is what happens when the director is given %100 control of the story and then DUMPS all of what was going to be the plan... the Continuity of the plot will be F*cked forever...","true":true}
