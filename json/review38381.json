Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst movie I've ever seen. Putting Luke on an island to mope around and give up was insulting enough. Making Luke milk that beast and then drink it on camera was like a dump truck of salt in the wounds. What a joke. Then Luke trying to kill his nephew in his sleep... this is the worst. The film maker has no idea who Luke Skywalker is.","true":true}
