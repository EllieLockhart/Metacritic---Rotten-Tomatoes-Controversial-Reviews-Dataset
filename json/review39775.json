Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is an amazing movie i loved it everything the cast characters adventure storytelling advances in shape that it takes the force from both sides the twists and flaws within the heroes and villains the porgs and crystal wolves were pretty cool also there's a lot to love here and i look forward to episode 9 this isn't the prequels or the original and i truly find it hilarious that people can both criticise this new trilogy for being to similar to the originals at the same time complain that its not the originals there's a lot new here and much to love if you didn't love it watch it one more time you would be surprised what a second look can sometimes do","true":true}
