Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the entire movie\\, and probably for the same reason that so many neckbeards hated it.\\n\\nThere may be slight spoilers\\, so read beyond this at your own peril.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong\\, there are definitely things they could have done better. Interactions that lasted a little too long or felt just a little off. However\\, the whole of the movie is far better then the parts say it should be. There are so many parts that are so good. However this review has to stay short so I will only cover four.\\n\\nI love the fact that it destroyed the whole Skywalker bloodline as being the center of the movie and universe. The fact that Rey supposedly is not anyone special\\, that her family were just drunks means you don't have to be a Solo or a Skywalker to have the Force choose you or to be able to wield it. Some say that isn't what the movie says\\, but I just leave the example of the child at the end using the force to pick up the broom.\\n\\nI love the fact that Kylo Ren is an obvious stand in for the whiney alt-right man babies. He whines about the same things and throws the same kind of fits. His callous disregard for Rey being uncomfortable with him being shirtless is just one small\\, tiny example that encapsulates the alt-right self-importance. The whole crying about remaking the empire sparks that same MAGA concept the racists\/sexist crowd in real life spouts. It is perfect movie model of real life.\\n\\nI also am ecstatic that it destroys the expanded universe of Star Wars. I am sorry everyone\\, but I am old enough to have read those books when they came out but the vast majority of them SUCKED. I mean absolutely sucked with no redeeming quality. I am glad to sacrifice the few good things to get rid of the rest of that garbage. I like that Disney is making a clean slate to entertain and tell a story about that universe\\, especially once SW IX is done.\\n\\nHowever\\, the final part and best part is making space for people who aren't white males as heroes and as the center of the story. This is coming from a white male\\, I am damn tired of the same old tired stories that don't give everyone else a chance in the spotlight. I can easily watch and love something that has women\\, alternate orientations\\, and people of color as the stars. I can identify them as someone to look up to. This benefits everyone\\, gives us a richer field to choose movies from and puts everyone on the same footing. \u00a0I look forward to more of this and I will happily spend my hard earned money supporting these ventures.\\n\\nThe good:\u00a0The wide range of actors and actresses\\, the opening up of the universe\\, and just about everything SJW this movie does.\\n\\nThe bad:\u00a0There were little things that bothered me\\, but nothing any other movie would have done. The biggest bad of this is having to wait 2 more years for SW IX.","true":true}
