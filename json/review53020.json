Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"AS A \\\"MOVIE IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE\\\"\\, IT was ok -  BUT THE CONSTANT CHEAP GAGS MADE IT FEEL OUT OF PLACE IN THE SKYWALKER NONOLOGY.\\nThere were some nice touches in the movie but not enough to redeem its shortfalls and I pity Abrahams\\, picking up the loose ends from Johnson's big FU to the fans. \\n\\nSUMMARISING THE faults:\\nHux was turned into a comedy straight man.\\nSPACESHIPS THAT CAN GO FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT CAN'T CATCH UP with A SHIP THAT IS GOING A FEW THOUSAND MILES PER HOUR.\\nJET-PACK LEIA WITH SUPER-HEATED\\, OXYGEN-PRODUCING CLOTHING. \\n\\\"ForceTime\\\" between Kylo & Rey was a blatant plot device with no prior founding.  \\nThe whole Canto Bight thing was pointless plot device to develop Rose & Finn's characters but amounted to nothing. \\nSnoke was killed without a back story or a proper fight\\, reducing him to a whimsical character. \\nNo explanation was given to Snoke & Ben Solo's acquaintance. \\nPhasma was beaten by luck. \\nTHE PROJECTION OF LUKE SKYWALKER CAN'T BE TOUCHED BUT THE DICE HE BROUGHT CAN...
