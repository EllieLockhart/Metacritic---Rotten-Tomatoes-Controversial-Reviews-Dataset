Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was utterly disappointing. A big slap to the face of all fans of Star Wars. The massive amounts of plot holes and useless scenes is unbearable. The casino scene and plot with Finn\/Rose is utterly disgraceful. Rose is one of the worst characters ever since Jar Jar. That's saying something. Everything I love about Star Wars was ruined in this movie. It feels like some cheesy\\, big budget Sci-Fi movie in some galaxy that is NOT Star Wars. A big shame. The trailer was interesting and I was hoping to leave the movie satisfied. Disney buying the franchise was the worst thing to happen to Star Wars.","true":true}
