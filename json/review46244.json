Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"was along movie first off! \\,the first half was laughable\\, the 2nd boring and pushing political messages! the 3rd part was fun but not enough to save the movie. really stupid things I found in the movie \\, Lura Dern in a evening dress! She is supposed to be a battle hardened admiral! the casino plot just totally unneeded and stupid\\, Luke's roll was annoying and wooden\\, captain Phasma was an after thought\\, Snoke who was one of the better characters and actors is killed off in such a anticlimactic fashion\\, although fun the last battle scene is almost a total rip off of the battle of hoth\\, trying to be very politically correct to a fault! the whole plot about the fleet trying to escape the new order fleet was just dumb \\, really after all the space battles in Star wars this how the alliance could have avoided destruction the whole time? just stay a little ahead of the empires fleet? Wow!","true":true}
