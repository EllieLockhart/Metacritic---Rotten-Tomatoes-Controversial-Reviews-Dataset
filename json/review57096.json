Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a horrible Star Wars movie. its been tainted by Disney to cater to a 'wider audience'. There are many missteps but the most unforgivable isn't that it tosses aside the setup from J.J. Abrams vision in Force Awakens. It isn't that they try and add campy humor at inopportune times or even those damn porgs...it's the destruction of what Luke Skywalker stood for and the man he is. SPOILER AHEAD... The man who went on a suicide mission to try and turn his father\\, a mass murdering deadbeat dad who slaughtered children and destroyed the Jedi order\\, because a saw a glimpse of good left in him\\, wouldn't give up on his nephew and try and murder him in his sleep because he felt some dark side tendencies. Luke wouldnt act that way and he would never become the broken shell of a man he is in this movie. Luke wouldnt give up and move to an island to die feeling sorry for himself. Even Mark Hamill himself states this and he knows the character better than anyone. A majority of fans who grew up with the original trilogy feel cheated. The director tosses aside what the fans of the franchise wanted and believed all to further his artistic vision and in doing so alienated a generation of fans. ","true":true}
