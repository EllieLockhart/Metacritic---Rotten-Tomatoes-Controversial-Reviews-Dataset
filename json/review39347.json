Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is bad written and lacks rythm. I liked ep.VII\\, which not only was not a bad movie but also a quite pleasing iteration of the saga\\, but I find this film fuzzy and disrespectful to the whole saga. It does not have a clear goal and it spends an hour and a half in a plot that is poorly written and that in the end does not affect the final output of the movie.\\nThis is a bad movie and what is worse\\, it damages the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
