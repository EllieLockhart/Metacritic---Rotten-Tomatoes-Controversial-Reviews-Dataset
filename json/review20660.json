Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've seen this film twice and it's incredible\\, my new favorite out of all of the Star Wars films including Empire Strikes Back (now my Second favorite) Mark Hamill deserves an Oscar for his performance. Pure\\, raw emotion can be felt every time he is on screen. Plenty of unexpected turns and I my opinion this is what Star Wars needed\\, a shift in direction and tone. To quote Luke Skywalker himself.  \\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\"","true":true}
