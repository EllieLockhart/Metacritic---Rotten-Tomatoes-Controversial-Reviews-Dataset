Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"We really enjoyed this film and the direction they took the story. I\u2019m so glad the characters aren\u2019t flat and we witness the internal struggle to make honorable choices. The humor wasn\u2019t overdone \u2014 perfectly timed. The chemistry between Kylo Ren and Rey was unexpected\\, but VERY welcomed. We cannot wait for it to be released digitally so the whole family can watch it again. ","true":true}
