Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a huge Star Wars fan\\, I liked this movie. I have to say it is in my top 3 favorites. There have been a ton of negative reviews and a lot of fan backlash about this movie. I feel that as much as anything this is because the writers and directors and Disney did not ask the fans to write and direct the movie. Everyone who ever had an opinion about how this movie should go or a theory of their own was massively dissapointed. None of it happened. I say forget what you thought should have happened and go watch it again\\, you might just realize its better than you thought. Sure there are parts that could be better and things that i wish didnt happen\\, but all in all I think this is a great Star Wars movie.","true":true}
