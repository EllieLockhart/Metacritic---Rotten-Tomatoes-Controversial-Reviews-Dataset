Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong Star Wars fan i hated this movie. The story was bad and filled with plote holes. The jokes took me out of the movie as did some of the strange choices they made with Leia\\, the \\\"force skyping\\\"\\, alien milking\\, etc all of this on top of what tjey did to Luke Skywalker makes this prequel level bad for me. 1 star.","true":true}
