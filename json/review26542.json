Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh dear\\, what a waste of an opportunity this film was. \\n\\nFrom the very first scene\\, something just felt totally off. From the ridiculous General Hugs joke that got stretched out for what seemed like a lifetime\\, to Hug's woeful overacting\\, it set the tone for the rest of the movie. \\n\\nLot's of potential\\, but some terrible decisions from Johnson that just ruined the movie. Don't get me wrong\\, it's a gorgeous film that has some fantastically entertaining moments\\, but there were just too many moments of spectacular stupidity that I just couldn't get over as they happened so regularly. \\n\\nIt felt like Johnson was bound by his contract to start each new scene with a god awful joke aimed exclusively at 5 year olds. Hugs\\, Luke throwing the saber\\, Finn leaking\\, topless kylo\\, wheel barrow smash\\, anything containing Rose\\, Luke shoulder dusting\\, I'll spare you listing them all... but last and by no means least THE Luke Skywalker milking a sea cow and gulping it down. I wanted to walk out there and then\\, that was worse than prequels bad. \\n\\nStar wars was always just light hearted in places\\, but they were few and far between. They are attempting to turn it into a straight up comedy and it just fails as the jokes are poor and they just don't fit. \\n\\nI hate the extension of force powers. It's a fantasy film\\, you need to leave rational thinking at the door. But the best films are still bound by their own set of rules. The OT force\\, was powerful but it never felt like the force gave them almost unlimited powers. \\n\\nNow it almost feels like anything and everything is possible and they can just explain things away\\, that you'd never have previously thought possible as being force related. If force users can survive space\\, or project themselves anywhere\\, or can become the most powerful user ever in the space of about 3 days (Rey)\\, what fear for the safety of those characters is there. Leya Poppins was just the cherry on the cake of that... if she had died there and then after Kylo spared her\\, it would of had a far more powerful effect. \\n\\nThe whole Finn and Rose arc was a total waste of time and has been talked to death about in the comments. Pointless. \\n\\nHoggle or whatever her name was\\, another fairly pointless character. Remove her and the two above and have Akbar crash at light speed and the movie might just have been passable as a follow up to the FA\\n\\nThe biggest wastes for me were Snoke and Luke\\, both snuffed out of the trilogy far to quickly without ever really forfilling the potential both characters had\\, a criminal use of the of the more interesting characters\\, leaving more bland characters like Finn and Rose. \\n\\nI know they want to set up the new character and the new stories and move on from the OT. But there are generations of people who have waited 30 years+ to see Luke light up his saber one last time and we've been robbed of that opportunity. Him taking out a few troopers ala Vader in TFA and the itch would have been scratched for generations of fans. Now our abiding memory is him not even leaving his island and suckling a sea cow for green milk. \\n\\nSomeone with some time on their hands will edit Johnsons mess and at least give us something watchable by cutting out an hours worth of pointless nonsense he provided throughout.","true":true}
