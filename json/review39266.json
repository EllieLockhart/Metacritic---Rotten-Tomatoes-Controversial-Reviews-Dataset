Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film has few redeeming qualities. A moronic joke made by Poe at the start of the movie sets the farcical tone carried throughout this failure of a blockbuster. The only undeniable success of The Last Jedi is its ability to completely wreak havoc upon Star Wars canon. I wish I had my time and money back.","true":true}
