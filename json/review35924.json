Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The \\\"Last Jedi\\\" is to Star Wars\\, what the \\\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\\" was to Indiana Jones\\, and what Peter Jackson's Hobbit part 2 was to the actual book.\\n\\nGoing to see Star Wars the Last Jedi is like going to a Killers concert but seeing Maroon 5 walk on stage.","true":true}
