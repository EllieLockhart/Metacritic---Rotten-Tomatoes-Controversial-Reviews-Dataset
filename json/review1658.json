Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie\\, it is very entertaining. As a STAR WARS movie\\, it has to be the worst ever made. Making Luke a disenchanted\\, bitter\\, old hermit who attempts to kill a young boy\\, and with no desire to redeem himself or help Rey. Worse yet\\, simultaneously killing off the bad guy (Snoke) and Luke at the same time\\, knowing that Carrie is gone. Ugh. The franchise is on very slippery ground. The only thing that could possibly be worse is if JJ Abrams has Rey and Kylo fall in love. That would kill the franchise.","true":true}
