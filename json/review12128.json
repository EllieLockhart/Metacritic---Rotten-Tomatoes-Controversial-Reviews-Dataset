Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan and I hated it.  There is some good stuff in it sure\\, but this movie has little to no plot\\, one dimensional characters\\, some groan worthy atempts at humor\\, and some face palming story points.  Does anybody want to see magic Leia fly?  How bout a planet of evil rich people\\, cause\\, rich people are bad.  They test weapons on poor people and enslave kids and abuse animals.  It was like the story was written by Antifa.  Wanna watch Rey snap her fingers for several minutes?  You got it!   Why does she?  Who can tell?  How about a slow space ship chase for two hours?  Check!  A clever battle plan of the \\\"prank phone call\\\".  Check!   A horrible CGI sequence?  You got it!  Rian Johnson does a really good Prequel George Lucas impression.  If you heard you will hate the cutesy Porgs\\, don't worry about it.  They are the least of this movies worries.","true":true}
