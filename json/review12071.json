Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I agree with almost every negative complaint that has been said about this movie. \\n\\nHollywood has forgotten how to tell stories that are meaningful and inspiring\\, and have replaced it with diversity quotas\\, leftist\/sjw political themes\\, and abolishing the heart of the original Star Wars universe. Absolute trash. This film is not cannon. \\n\\nAlso there are some sketching things going on with how this film is covered. Large format media outlets paint the film backlash as a small minority. I don't believe this to be true after reading reviews and general audience response. Who are these people who think the film is good? I haven't met them. The \\\"small minority\\\" is near everyone. I wouldn't be surprised if the rotten tomato audience rating drops below 30% in time. \\n\\nThis isn't just a bad film\\, it undoes everything episides 1-7 have established. Absolute disgrace.","true":true}
