Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Bad movie with no intresting plot\\, bland character. The humor is always out of place. The force has become the new deus ex machina. The treatment of luke and Leia is awful. The new character are boring and make dumb decisions. There are no important aliens and it's a shame for a galaxy supposed to be far far away. Rey is still the greatest mary sue ever. She can lift tons of boulder with 2 days of training defeat the imperial red guards with no lightsaber training and fly the falcon beter than han or chewie... Anything new added to the SW mythology and we don't see how is going the rest of the galaxy (lack of political background) what a terrible movie. Worst than any prequel wich are good.","true":true}
