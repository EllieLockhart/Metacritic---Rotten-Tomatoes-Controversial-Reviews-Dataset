Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is probably the worst Star Wars movie I have seen. There is so much I didn't like and below are just a few of those things (spoilers!)\\n\\n- How Luke Skywalker is presented and how he dies feels so out of character and cheap. This is not the Luke we know\\, this is an abomination.\\n\\n- How Snoke was supposed to be this super awesome villain and then just killed off with no backstory or explanation at all.\\n\\n- Finn is too much of a clumsy comedian and a waste of Boyegas talent.\\n\\n- Leias \\\"Superman\\\" moment in space.... \\n\\n- Rey can't basicly fail\\, she is so powerfull and skilled without any training that I don't care about that character anymore.\\n\\n- Rose\\, DJ and Holdo could have been left out with no difference to the story.\\n\\n- Phasma is a disappointment yet again. Why cast Gwendoline Christie if you are just going to throw away this rather useless character?\\n\\nI end here. I don't really look forward to the next movie\\, the only thing the next one has going for it is that JJ Abrams is back.... yeah\\, The Last Jedi is that bad.","true":true}
