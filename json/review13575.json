Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt as though the movie would have been the perfect length if Fin and Rose's side story was excluded from the movie. I mean their entire plan was a little stupid to began with. It felt like I was watching the combination of two movies about different things. I felt as though maybe they overdid it with the rebels' desperation. I guess you were suppose to feel something for them but the multiple Disney aspects in the film kept me from doing that.","true":true}
