Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson peed in the Star Wars pool.  This installment went out of its way to undermine the previous films by destroying plot lines\\, character arcs\\, and even the basic mechanics of the Star Wars universe.  Johnson also takes a hard left turn by using the film as a giant virtue signal against income inequality and the patriarchy\\, introducing new characters with no depth of character that appear solely for the purpose of making the film \\\"woke\\\".  It is a huge departure from the escapism offered by the previous installments of the franchise.  This film has left the trilogy in perilous straights and will take some impressive craftsmanship from the next director to right the ship.","true":true}
