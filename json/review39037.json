Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Things blew up nicely\\, there was a lot of really nice cinematography\\, the music seemed lovely...the rest was cringe worthy trash. The plot was weak and boring. The sub plot was completely pointless and should have been avoided. I never write reviews\\, but this utter failure makes me angry enough to write something. Rey\\, never looses anything\\, she never has to train or learn anything. Her character was such a complete let down that it makes me ill. They had so much potential so many possible directions they could have gone but they chose this. Even if I wasn't a Star Wars fan...as a movie this is a complete failure. Physics? I can suspend my disbelief only so far before it just gets embarrassing. If I could give it negative stars I would.","true":true}
