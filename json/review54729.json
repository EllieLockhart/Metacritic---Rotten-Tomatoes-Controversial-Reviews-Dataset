Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it a second time yesterday. The film is about as superficial as one would expect from a high-budget Disney sci-fi movie. The gags seemed a bit better spaced than I had originally thought yesterday\\, but the film overall just felt like I was watching Avengers 2\\, or Captain America 5\\, or something along those lines. No matter how much I tried to give it a chance\\, I just couldn't stand the way the movie laughs at the First Order. It makes them out to be more like a clown car of idiots rather than an actual tyrannical remnant of the Empire that is on the brink of crushing the rebellion and taking control of the galaxy. The original Star Wars trilogy never trivialized the Empire\\, it took them seriously\\, why can't the resistance take the First Order seriously? You can have the entirety of Luke's fight with Kylo serve as all the embarrassment needed to crush the ego of the First Order. The first scene between Poe and General Hux was totally unnecessary and again was a cheap trick to make the audience laugh at the malevolent bad guys. The film fails to meet the standard of the original trilogy. Perhaps it's a sign of the times\\, but I'm so sick of the Disney formula of \\\"laugh\\, serious\\, awkward\\, laugh\\, more awkward\\, HERO TIME\\, serious\\, COOL STUFF\\, DRAMA\\, laugh some more\\, rinse\\, repeat\\, END FILM\\\" and as a Star Wars fan\\, I am saddened to see how it seeped into the franchise. The movie is visually pretty\\, some cool shit happens\\, but its rewatchability factor is very low because of how weak the script is and how half-baked some of the characters in this film are. The ones that gave good performances were Hamill\\, Driver\\, Serkis\\, and Dern. Everyone else left me wanting.","true":true}
