Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most insulting film I have seen since The Force Awaken. Parading around the Star Wars franchise to it has nothing left.\\nThis film does everything wrong. Luke is completely out of character and logic does not serve this film well. How much the prequel where bad\\, atleast there was originality. The characters are complete joke especially the OT ones. Kylo Ren while well acted is given zero development. As for Rey\\, she is certified Mary Sue with zero redeeming characteristics.","true":true}
