Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A hideously nihilistic and nonsensical story that makes the Phantom Menace look like a competent production. The lead director talks of \\\"subverting expectations.\\\" Well\\, he did: I expected this movie to be good\\, and he subverted my expectations. Don't waste your money.","true":true}
