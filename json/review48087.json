Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the plot isn't the best\\, it is still easier to follow than most of the other Star Wars movies. It doesn't get bogged down in complex politics\\, and instead teaches us how to love the new characters more. It is an excellent transition from the old generation to the new one\\, and it shows all of the new characters learning from their mistakes and making new friendships. It has one of the best scenes in all of the franchise - you'll know it when you see it - and the ending parallels an old moment in a beautiful way. It really connects to the heart of Star Wars\\, about the power of hope and love.","true":true}
