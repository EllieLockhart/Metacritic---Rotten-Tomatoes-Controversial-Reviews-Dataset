Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not even as good as Attack of the Clones. At least that movie furthered the story of the Star Wars Universe. The entire Casino scene could have been done away with (as could the character of Rose). This entire movie was filler nonsense to get to the next big CGI effect battle scene. Poorly written and predictable dialogue for characters lacking any depth (with the exception of Kylo and Rey). Rian Johson alludes to the fact they might give some backstory on Snoke in the next trilogy...not that he matters now since he was insignificant enough to kill off halfway through this trilogy. Speaking of Snoke he is powerful enough with the force to \\\"connect\\\" people through it\\, but cant tell the lightsaber a foot away from him is shifting? Lazy writing. Wonder how much this site gets paid by Disney to have a 93% audience score. Created an account just to review this movie which was mediocre at best and could've been condensed into 1.5 hours while using that last hour to give some backstory and good plot. But we got a cool lightspeed kamikaze attack from Holdo instead !!","true":true}
