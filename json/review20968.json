Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was hopeful for this movie and I wanted to see what direction Rian Johnson was going to take.  To my surprise and that of many star war fans the direction he took was very unexpected\\, The story telling of this movie was very poor. They had this blank canvas to work with and to all of our surprise it has been the worst star wars movie I have ever seen. Do take in consideration that it was even worst then episode 1 with Jar jar.  The introduction of new characters that had nothing to do with the previous installment let alone with the star wars lore. They could have gone more into depth into the story of Ray and Fin but apparently telling a good story is not important anymore\\, it is all about diversity\\, current political and social justice warrior views. I don't care if the roles were played by woman\\,men\\, asian\\,black\\,white what ever. I wanted to see a good star wars movie story told\\, but what we got was a joke. Please do not include your political or social views into movies\\, we get plenty of that on a regular basis with the news and every other TV news outlet out there. We just wanted a movie that had a great story to tell and not this piece of social justice crap that was conjured by Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy.  I will boicot both the upcoming installments of the star war movies and I suggest you do the same.","true":true}
