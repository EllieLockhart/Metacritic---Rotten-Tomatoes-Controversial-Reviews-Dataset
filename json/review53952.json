Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge star wars fan and have been since I was a child\\, this movie however is flat out not good. There are a few specific scenes that were great like Luke's last stand at the end and the dynamic between Kylo and Rey but a good chunk of the film had scenes that were boring or downright unnecessary. I never felt bored watching a star wars film until I saw this one\\, many people here seem to feel the same way I do about the casino plotline which is a perfect example of something that could have been cut. Considering this is one of the longest star wars films its amazing how much unnecessary junk was kept in\\, didn't like the way they handled Phasma\\, Snoke or Reys plotlines in this film and the scene where Leia pulls herself out of space back into the ship Mary Poppins style is just laughable\\, Luke's story seems to run contrary to the values he stood for in the original trilogy\\, he went from being an arbiter of good to trying to murder his own nephew and living as a hermit\\, it makes sense in the story but I don't think it was befitting of a character like Luke. Overall this movie is a confusing mess\\, I would seriously rather watch Episode 1 or a sequel devoted to Jar Jar Binks than this long boring disgrace to my eyeballs.","true":true}
