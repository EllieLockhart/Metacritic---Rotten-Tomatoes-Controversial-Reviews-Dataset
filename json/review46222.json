Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(Warning: some spoilers) The plot of this movie\\, combined with the Force Awakens\\, totally destroys everything the rebels were fighting for in the original trilogy.  In the original trilogy you came to care for the rebellion\\, a classic fight of good vs. evil.  Even though the good guys took some kicks in the teeth\\, they came out victorious in Return of the Jedi.  This movie\\, combined with The Force Awakens\\, shows that everything they fought for was for nothing.  All of the sacrifices made and the fight for their ideals resulted in failure.  Now\\, there are just a handful of rebels (resistance) left and we're supposed to be happy about that.\\nThis movie actually makes the original trilogy\\, along with Rogue One\\, harder to watch because you know that everything they fought for was for nothing.","true":true}
