The world and the characters were so believably\rund well written and most people loved it for that. You dived into this world and it was\rso exciting and thrilling! I was so emotionally invested in it\\, because I could relate and understand\rthe characters and I felt how they felt\\, they really grew on me.\r\rThis is not the case for The Last of Us Part 2 unfortunately.\r\rBut first I want to start with the positive things of this game.\rThe Graphics and animations are beautiful\\, breathtaking even.\rI loved to explore and look at all the details and surroundings\\, it is really amazing\rhow much work was put into all of this!\rThe gameplay is pretty fun and very much like the first one\\,\rif you enjoyed the gameplay from the first one\\, you probably will have fun with this too.\rYou can also play a lot with the difficulty settings and adjust the difficulty to challenge yourself\rif you like that. I really wish I could say more positive things for this game\\, but it ends here.\r\rThe negative things are unfortunately the things that I loved the most in the first part.\rThe world\\, characters and their relationships. I wanted to see more of that and\ryou can only imagine how excited I was for the second part\\, hoping to see my beloved characters again and seeing another adventure with them.\rBut Naughty Dog had other plans. The trailers didn't represent the real game\\,\rit hides a lot and even changed some of the scenes completely.\rThey even said \\\"This game will honor Joel and Ellie\\\".\rAfter finishing the game I really don't understand how they can say something like that.\rSince when is spitting on your characters and destroying them completely\\, \\\"honoring\\\" them?\rI can't really trust Naughty Dog anymore after seeing everything they did to misguide their\rown fans and destroying most of the things that their fans loved.\r\rOur characters feel like they were swapped out\\, they do a lot of very uncharacteristic things\rand I couldn't believe that the same writer from The Last of Us 1\rwrote this story. There are a lot of plotholes and unrealistic things happening and\rit destroyed the immersion for me\\, I can't dive into a game that is so unlogically written\rand spits on everything that I loved from the first game.\r\rThe story and the ending is just pointless and sad\\, you lose everything.\rThis isn't a satisfying ending for this series.\rIt would have been better if The Last of Us ended after the first Part.\rThis is not a worthy successor.\rI personally don't recommend this game for passionate fans from the first one\\,\rbut if you want to play it anyway\\, experience it for yourself and maybe you like it.\rUnfortunately don't\\, I will just pretend that there is no Part 2\\, otherwise I can't really cope with this.\r\rSorry for typos\\, english isn't my main language.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
