Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)\\n10 hours ago via Rotten Tomatoes\\nHow does Luke retrieve the fish from the 100' long spear? What an inefficient method of fishing. Should have just used the Force. Sadly\\, the greatest Jedi of all time doesn't use much of the force in this \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie. Too busy moping around the island like the old curmudgeon we're asked to believe he has become. It's a sham. SO many plot holes in this debacle. The movie is a mess yet critics seem to be singing its praise while the masses are calling out this crap fest for what it is. It's a betrayal of all things Star Wars. Especially a betrayal of Luke's character. Disney is blaming bots for the low audience reaction which is laughable. Maybe your movie just sucks. Think about this\\, the critic rating on this site is placing Last Jedi up among the ranks of classics like The Godfather. Are you kidding me? The audience has it right and the truth will come out as soon as the returns are counted on episode IX. I don't even care what happens in the final episode\\, as sad as that is to say\\, I just don't care. I don't even know why there needs to be one. RIP Star Wars. #NotMyLuke","true":true}
