Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, but the comedy falls flat and feels forced half the time. The subplots are half-baked at best\\, and there's hardly any character development. While Rian Johnson makes a lot of bold choices with regards to the storyline\\, I truly believe that he has written J.J. Abrams into a corner with regards to the Episode IX storyline. My biggest criticism is that this didn't feel like a Star Wars film; rather\\, it felt like an indie-comedic-western film with space ships and laser swords thrown in. Oh\\, and (**SPOILER ALERT***) the part where Leia uses the Force to float back into the ship like Tinkerbell was pure\\, 100% GARBAGE.","true":true}
