Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many things about this movie were terrible. I hated the way they portrayed Luke Skywalker! The scene with young Kylo went so against his character. All the ideas floating around about how to bring Luke back and this was the one that was chosen? The plot about the rebellion staying just ahead of the First Order was really lame. Couldn't one of those ships just jump ahead of the main rebel ship? Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, those little birds\\, the rings that will soon be available at toy stores everywhere. Worst Star Wars movie\\, ever!","true":true}
