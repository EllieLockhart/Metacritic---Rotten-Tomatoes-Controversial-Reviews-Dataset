Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An absolute stinker with a shiny outer coat. Good performances\\, good direction\\, good visuals\\, terrible story. Feels like it was created by someone with no understanding of and\/or no love for the IP. \\n\\nI can understand the desire to try something new\\, but the main saga isn't the place to do that. That story thread is now broken beyond repair (not that The Force Awakens had been a particularly good setup). A sad stumbling end to what was once the greatest cinematic story ever told.
