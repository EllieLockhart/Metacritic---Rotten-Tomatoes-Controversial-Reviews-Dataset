Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Johnson was so busy being post-post-modern that he forgot to write a story. \\\"The rebels ride a white ford bronco down the freeway...\\\" The whole \\\"fans take themselves too seriously\\\" goes for film school grads too Rian. It doesn't have plot holes\\, it has a plot mesh.","true":true}
