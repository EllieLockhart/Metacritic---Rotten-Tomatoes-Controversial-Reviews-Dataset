Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I actually really enjoyed this new installment in the Star Wars saga. It took many twists and turns I didn't expect and had great and memorable scenes and characters. I have one or two negatives but I also have many positives. I think director Rian Johnson did a great job with this film. This film can feel very odd at first but in my second viewing I understood and enjoyed it much more then my first. The film still left us a few more questions that will hopefully be answered in the next chapter.","true":true}
