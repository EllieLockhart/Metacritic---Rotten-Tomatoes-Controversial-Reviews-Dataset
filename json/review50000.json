Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You will love the movie IF you let go of your hate of it not being the film you think it should be and just watch it for what it is. That is a jab at all the people hating on the movie because it doesn't follow their preconceived ideas of how everything should be and not how the storey tell is expanding the universe.","true":true}
