Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kathleen Kennedy is a liar\\, Rian Johnson is incompetent and Disney doesn't care about Star Wars\\, its fans\\, or the Galactic universe. They lack creative vision and they spit in the face of every Star Wars fan with this debacle. Save your money its a sham!\\n\\nI loved the idea of a new Star Wars trilogy and I had such high hopes for this film. The prequels ( Episodes I\\,II\\,III) were not necessarily well made\\, there is a lot that could've been improved on in those films\\, But for the most part they made sense\\, while they managed to explain and cover key plots. \\n\\nThis new chapter in the saga is filled with more questions and head scratchers and a lot of WTF moments than you can shake a lightsaber at. While there are some amazing visuals and there are some things that are exceptionally well done in this film. I am being quite generous to suggest that this movie is no more than a 1 star movie. The more I go back and think about the story and how it was carried out\\, the more disappointed I become. Even the animated series Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels are superior in every category of significance.\\n\\nIt is not an exaggeration to suggest that Rogue One the first Star Wars movie with no Jedi is by far a superior film. It has a much better story\\, more compelling characters\\, & was executed much better than TLJ.. Final grade D","true":true}
