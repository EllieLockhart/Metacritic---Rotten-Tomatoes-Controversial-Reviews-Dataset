Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"3 problems with this movie.\r\\n1-Blatant attempt to advance a progressive political agenda.\r\\n-men are bad\\, stupid or to eager to fight\/ women are less violent\\, better leaders?\r\\n-rich people profit from war\\, enslave children\\, mistreat animals\\,\r\\n-religion(jedi) is bad\\, should end\\, temples destroyed\\, books burned. \r\\n-don?t eat meat\\, etc.. \r\\n2-illogical plot \/ subplot and scenes in the context of the Star Wars universe.  Aspects of the expanded created universe were discarded or added with complete disregard to its overall implication for one purpose (see problem #1)\r\\nExemples:\r\\n- Ghost force Yoda uses lighting to burn down Jedi Temple.  The implication of this absurdity is that at any time Yoda or Obi Wan could easily end the conflict by zapping any and all bad guys.  Also\\, could have been done before to easily take out the Emperor.  This is STUPID to an unprecedented level! The world created in Star Wars has rules\\, logical for that world. To throw it away simply to advance a political agenda is NUTS and disrespectful to fans.  In case you missed it\\, that action was nothing less than an attack on religion with Yoda as the proxy.\r\\n-The hyperspeed detector.  Never existed before\\, never needed before.  (For a space chase go watch ANH and ESB). The detector novelty exists only to create 2 absurd storylines. One that paints Poe as a warmonger dumbass (for the 2nd time in the movie\\, I might add) who should listen to the smarter\\, less prone to violence\\, women around him. A second\\, that sends Finn on a quest to deactivate the detector by visiting a planet with plenty of \\\"political statements\\\".\r\\n-the hyperspeed weapon.  Changes the rules of war completely.  There only to enhance the virtues of \\\"purple hair lady\\\" and further embarrass Poe. As Rose said: \\\"Don't kill the ones you hate\\, save the ones you love?.   Oops! Ah yes\\, I forgot that only applies to men.  Man hates\\, woman loves. \r\\n-Intergalactic Facetime (acceptable\\, if caused by Snoke a supreme Force user) but needs to be explained.\r\\n-No Force training required. Rey is awesome at everything. \r\\n\r\\n3- Dismantlement of several storylines in previous movie of the trilogy. Again\\, the storyline changes have one purpose (see problem #1).\r\\n-Anakin\/Luke Lightsaber literary thrown away.\r\\n-Snoke subplot cut to pieces.\r\\n-Knights of Ren completely omitted.\r\\n-Rey's background? Utterly irrelevant.\r\\n- Map\/Search for Luke (the main plot line of TFA) discarded. \\n-Luke Jedi Temple pilgrimage for Force knowledge replaced by depressed\\, bitter Luke.\r\\nAll of it pushed aside to further the agenda : to knock down the central tenet of the StarWars universe \\\"Good vs Evil\\\". To toss aside the notion of Hero\\, of family of tradition. To destroy the mythology behind Star Wars.\r\\n\r\\nWhat is truly amazing is how far Johnson\/Kennedy (not to be confuse with Kennedy\/Johnson) were willing to sacrifice the building blocks of multi-billion saga to advance their political agenda.","true":true}
