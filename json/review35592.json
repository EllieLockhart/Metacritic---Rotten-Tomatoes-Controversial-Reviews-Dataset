Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a film that takes a lot of risks\\, some may love it\\, others may hate it\\, but in the end I was completely satisfyed with the the direction they took.","true":true}
