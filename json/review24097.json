Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Massive starwars fan..found it was forced into a disney movie to avoid showing any blood. Fight scenes were bad in comparison. I walked out saying why. The story doesnt make sense if you think about it. And the sacrifice at the end.... i was like come on.","true":true}
