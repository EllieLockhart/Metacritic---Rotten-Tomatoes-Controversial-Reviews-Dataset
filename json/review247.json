It starts out really nicely. It has good creep factor and as you go thorough out the story it actually has really good development! Sadly\\, although you can decide who lives and who dies the main premise is only differed slightly and incrementally (unlike Heavy Rain). That said\\, while this game boasts about how your choices greatly influence the outcome of the story.... they don't. Your influence is very minimal and Emily ALWAYS lives regardless and the mysterious stranger can't be saved--he must die EVERY time. There are also character traits that also change with your choices. You can boost or hurt relationships with other characters\\, become braver or less\\, honest or not....but regardless\\, it makes absolutely no difference in how they act towards one another which sucks and is kind of too bad. The only thing that changes ending wise is who lives and who dies...only to some extent. There aren't really DIFFERENT endings per-say (like in silent hill) just more like... a few options as to who is there when it ends.\r\rThe story\\, however\\, was actually pretty good--at least the first part of it. Once it went on with wendigos though it just died. It went from being a really cool murder mystery with a potential real killer (which seemed to be the case since it set out to be realistic and not anything to do with fantasy game) to just garbage. In every version of the story\\, there will be wendigos (AKA Magical Cannibals) and that\\, for me\\, is a big game ruiner. They made me absolutely not care about the rest of the game or what happened to anyone. Especially when the characters decided it was a good idea NOT to stay still (which is how you avoid them) and instead go to the mines (their nest) at night (while they're awake) and run around. SMART! NOT! It would have been SO much better if there had actually been a real psycho killer up on the mountain--not magical cannibals.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
