Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen it twice now. The first time\\, I would rank it just above the prequels. There were too many twists and unexpected outcomes to be truly enjoyable. However\\, I enjoyed it much more the second time. Now I would rank it about equal with Return of the Jedi\\, not quite as good as Rogue One or Empire Strikes Back\\, but still an excellent movie.","true":true}
