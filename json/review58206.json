Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You will like this film if you are under ten\\, or drunk\\, or a film critic on LSD\\, or a film critic that has been bought and paid for by the Disney Corporation\\, or anybody that has had a lobotomy.\\n\\nThe things I liked:\\n\\n+Flying Lea reminded me of Casper the Friendly ghost\\, and when I was a little kid I loved Casper\\, so that brought back happy childhood memories.\\n\\n+Looking forward to seeing how much flame gets thrown at this steaming pile when the Honest Trailer comes out.\\n\\n+It did NOT  have Jar Jar\\, Ewoks\\, young Anikan or midichlorians in it.\\n\\nThe things I did not like:\\n\\n-Story\\, story structure\\, character arcs\\, plot\\, and dialog. \\n\\n-Logic problems with everything.","true":true}
