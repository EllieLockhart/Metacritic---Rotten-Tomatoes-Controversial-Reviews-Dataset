Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Blatantly pays zero hommage to the lore. They just make things up and contradict hard truths from every other movie and show made in Star Wars previously. Honestly\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson made this movie feel like a bland 1990s low budget space movie rather than a Star Wars movie. They didn't even have a moment where luke and leia meet and rejoice.","true":true}
