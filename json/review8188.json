Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fantastic movie. Sure\\, it didn't satisfy the hordes of fanboys who obsessed over Snoke and Rey for two years\\, but that's their problem. They weren't owed delivery of their theories exactly how they wanted. The movie did its own thing\\, and did it well. It wasn't perfect\\, but its few flaws were more than made up for by its many great strengths. I've been watching Star Wars since the originals were new\\, and this was definitely legit Star Wars. I loved it\\, and can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
