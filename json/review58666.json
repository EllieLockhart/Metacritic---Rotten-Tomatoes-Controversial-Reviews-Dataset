Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"First of all: I can understand that people dislike the Game!I finished the game today and for me ist is a masterpiece! Here is why:Ellie\\, Ellie\\, Ellie! That Girl is so badass! i really enjoyed here seeking for revenge and here romance with Dina it all makes here so human (maybe more then some gamers nowadays can handle?)I hated to see Joel dying that early in the Game but thats the only thing i really dislike. Ok\\, maybe i wanted to jump off the roof with abby when i was forced to play her in the second half of the Game but that is what makes the Game so awesome. You have to get over that anger and try to understand what she did (btw i still hate her). It really broke my heart when i had to fight and nearly  kill Ellie with her but i still felt glad that Ellie spared her life in the very End. She finally was able to make a cut and move on. I  really hope they develop a 3rd Game and Ellie finds back to Dina and JJ\\, they are both her family and the only way she finds love and peace in the End.If you want a game that really gives you unforgetable Memorys and feelings this one is a must-buy.For me the best Single Player experience since years.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
