Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u0092ve never seen a film with so many endings before.  The films very long\\, but seems longer.  Apart from that the film has everything you\u0092d expect from a Star Wars film\\, comedy Robot\\, comedy creatures\\, comedy aliens\\, comedy Villain\\, lots of plot holes\\, lots of exposition. The only thing missing was Jar Jar Binks.","true":true}
