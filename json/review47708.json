Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I watched the film I had the same feeling at the end as when I saw the end of GOT; 'ok\\, I guess that was it\\, it was ok I guess. I would not watch it again\\, but yeeeeeah...' \\nAnd then as time goes on I start feeling cheated and then I check in on the internet and realise so do alot of other people no more cinema visits for Star Wars until they get there act together.\\nBig problem is there is no character development\\, every time a interesting challenge presents itself to the characters they make a choice that leads for a dull story.","true":true}
