Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the movie I think it was a really good and I'm not pleased with the audience score I think it's disrespectful to Carrie Fisher's Memory so I say this is the great movie I wouldn't say it's better than The Force Awakens But I really love it I would probably see it over and over again so I give this 5 stars","true":true}
