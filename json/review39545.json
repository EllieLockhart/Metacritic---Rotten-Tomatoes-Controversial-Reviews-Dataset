Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was better than TFA and didn\u2019t just feel like a remake of the original saga\u2019s revenge of the sith so I really respect that about the movie. The senes with Rey and Luke were really well done and actually sequences were exciting. But aside from Luke and Rey\\, the plot is dumb\\, messy\\, and all over the place\\, they tried to fit too much in and some of it is just so pointless it makes the movie boring and just makes you want to get back to the story of Luke and Rey","true":true}
