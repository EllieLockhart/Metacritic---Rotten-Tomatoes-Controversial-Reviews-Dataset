Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The cinematography equaled the money put into production. Visuals were stunning and the action was great but was very limited besides one scene of real merit. The jokes were forced at times and the lore of Star Wars has been stripped\\, effectively ruining the franchise to appeal to mainstream fans\\, even though they got this far without it ","true":true}
