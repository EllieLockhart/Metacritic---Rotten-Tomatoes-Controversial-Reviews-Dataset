Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie  but I felt it was poorly made. Beware some minor spoilers.\\nLarge plot holes: the first order could have destroyed the resistance at any point they just needed to jump closer. Rey's timeline does not match the chase timeline. Poor character development\\, especially for Rey; she is essentially the same character at the end of the movie she was at the beginning. They should have killed off several of the characters\\, there were fantastic emotional death scenes happening that were literally deus ex machinad away. Inversely several characters that died were needed to keep threat and tension. The movie doesn't really end on a cliffhanger there's no exciting conclusion you want resolved in the third movie. Finally Finn's subplot was unfortunately useless to the story.  It could have been completely cut and the story would progress the same. \\n\\nThe action on the acting were both good. I feel like somewhere in the footage is trapped a good movie...","true":true}
