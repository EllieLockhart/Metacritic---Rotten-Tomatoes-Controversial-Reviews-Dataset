Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account just for this movie since the critic reviews were so far off base.  This movie was an insult to every star wars movie ever made.  They should have allowed George Lucas to be involved during the script writing.  Rian Johnson has taken all of the wind out of the sails of this trilogy with this one.  I am sad to say that I no longer care about the characters and have zero interest in the next movie.  So many plot holes and poor decisions were made - kylo turning good no wait never mind he turned bad again\\, snoke amazing - no wait he's dead now\\, leia can survive the vacuum of space and fly without gravity\\, luke is now dead and for no justified reason\\, the first order could have just wiped up the resistance in the first five minutes\\, poe should be in jail not promoted\\, finn and rose's story was boring and completely needless\\, rose is completely uninteresting and a forced romance\\, the middle section on canto bight had no point other than to push a political agenda to the viewer\\, the slicer character was  awesome but turned against them and never redeemed himself\\, burning the jedi temple and all of the jedi history (that would never happen)\\, I could go on and on.  Why in the holy hell did they trick us into believing that Ben would switch sides and make us love the idea of that and then take it away five minutes later?  Was I the only one that loved the connection he had with Rey and the possible romance?  I feel swindled after seeing this movie and thinking about it more.  I feel better after typing this.\\n\\nUpdate - I forgot the biggest tragedy of all - Rey's parents are drug addicts or worse and she has no connection to anyone in the star wars universe at all.   Sure Anakin was a chosen one made from the force.  But\\, Anakin already had a story before we found this out.  With Rey we all wanted a \\\"I am your father\\\" moment that was so profound that it kept us wanting more.  Rian Johnson chose to give us the middle finger instead.","true":true}
