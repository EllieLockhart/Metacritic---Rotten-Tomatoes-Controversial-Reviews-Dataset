Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the worst Star Wars film to date. The Ewok TV movies are better than this.  Thought Force Awakens was bad\\, but TLJ is even worse. Have no interest in Episode IX\\, going to rewatch the original and prequel trilogies instead. Dont understand the critics reviews\\, they must have been paid off. Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson should both be fired.No","true":true}
