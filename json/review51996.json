Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After all the hype and waiting\\, The Last Jedi felt like an unsatisfactory addition to the series. It was plainly obvious that Rian Johnson held the story that was established in The Force Awakens with little regard. It felt that Johnson was leaning towards shock value or breaking tradition in exchange of making solid storytelling choices. In the end\\, big reveals felt cheap and no character except for the villain had proper character development.\\n\\nThe biggest mistake of this film is that for the lengthy run time\\, almost 2\/3 of the film's events felt pointless and had no lasting impact on the outcome of the film. The characters that I love from the Original Trilogy and from The Force Awakens felt like mere shadows of themselves and were incredibly out of character. The female characters\\, in particular\\, felt like degraded versions of themselves or fit overused stereotypical molds. Characters like Finn\\, who was the co-protagonist of the last film\\, was written down to comic relief and barely showed the heroic traits he had originally been given.\\n\\nAll in all\\, a big disappointment.","true":true}
