Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER alert\\n\\nA main story weak (lack of fuel\\, serious?) kill the great  supreme leader with a 'cheap trick'? Kill his guards without any body member lost? The main villain been fooled by everyone? Kill the master jedi in your most powerfull and wisdom phase? Destroy the finns journey pand introduce a boring partner in a boring arc? ... For god sake ryan... You could do your innovation-embraceTheNew in a different way... Gradually\\, developing more what JJ build in the previous (that I didnt like too) movie.... I liked a few things this last jedi.. Poes arc was great... Showing that isnt just about shot and destroy\\, but also about strategy.. Despite useful\\, the salt battle was beautiful... The island and the training could be more developed. Lost of my money going watch on tje movies... I am not exited for what are coming... DisneyRIPsw","true":true}
