Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought it was refreshing to see that Luke was shown as flawed. Kylo Ren is very conflicted which only adds to his poorly managed anger. Is everything completely believable? No\\, but this is a Star Wars. I\u2019ve been a faithful fan and my family was thoroughly entertained. ","true":true}
