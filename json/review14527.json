Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate to admit it\\, but I feel overwhelmingly let-down by this film.  On one hand\\, it was beautifully shot\\, Mark and Carrie delivered fantastic performances\\, and the film was so captivating that the 2 1\/2 hours went by quickly. Unfortunately\\, that's where the good stuff ends. I could provide a list of at least 25 things I did not like about the film\\, but suffice it to say that I disagreed with the overall direction of the story\\, the gaping plot holes\\, and the build-up of seemingly important characters from TFA that were abruptly cut out of the story.  Most of all\\, I felt that Mark Hamill was cheated in his role as Luke Skywalker--the fans deserved better\\, Disney.  If one thing is true\\, it is when Mark said (paraphrased\\, in reference to TFA)\\, \\\"if you think you are going to go into the movie theater and re-live your childhood\\, you are setting yourself up for a big disappointment.\\\"  The film was highly entertaining\\, but it was no Empire Strikes Back.","true":true}
