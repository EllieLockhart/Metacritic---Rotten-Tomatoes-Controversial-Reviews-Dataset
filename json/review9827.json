Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great action sequences\\, very good character development in some areas\\, bold choices and new ideas for a Star Wars film that feels true to its lineage and belongs in the classics. Some pacing issues and side storylines drag it a bit\\, but it sets the tone for the next one. VIsually stunning work by Rian Johnson.","true":true}
