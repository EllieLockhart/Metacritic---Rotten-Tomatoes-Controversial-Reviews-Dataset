Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing.  Visually stunning but full of plot holes and discontinuities.  Poor writing that continually surprises the viewer by disappointing with most questions answered by saying it means nothing.  Little to no development of back stories.  Rey unrealistically perfect and has no room to grow\\, which creates no connection by the viewer.  I've enjoyed all of the expanded universe books\\, games etc.  This is the most disappointing contribution to Star Wars since the holiday special.","true":true}
