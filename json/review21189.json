Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was watching parts of this movie\\, and it seemed crappy. Whoever thought of force projection should be banned from making star wars movies. General Leia should of died when she went into space. This movie is by far the worst and I'm done with star wars. Disney has no business owning this franchise\\, and doesn't care about making good products. Please don't make any more movies and let star wars rest in peace.","true":true}
