Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film breaks virtually every rule in storytelling to politicise some silly notions about societal reform and methodically sets about destroying the very canon which it tried to use as a springboard for their ideology. I never thought that \\\"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating..\\\" Could be made to look like compelling writing but here we are. \\n\\nI was upset about what was done to Star Trek\\, but this is a much higher level in perversion of canon.","true":true}
