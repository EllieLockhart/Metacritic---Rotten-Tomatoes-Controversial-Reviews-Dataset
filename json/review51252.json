Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely remarkable film. Johnson gives us so much to process\\, and delivers it so well. Even more than The Force Awakens\\, this film filled this reviewer with a newfound sense of wonder. This is a supercharged masterpiece that really can't be compared to the other episodes. Despite some minor pacing flaws early on\\, The Last Jedi is thoroughly epic and just so pleasing. Wonderful cinematography\\, great humor\\, great characterization. Truly the fantasy adventure Star Wars epic we all deserve. It's a shame Johnson won't return to round out trilogy.","true":true}
