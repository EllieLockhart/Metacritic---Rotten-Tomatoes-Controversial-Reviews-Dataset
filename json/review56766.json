Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was terrible and has essentially ruined any enthusiasm that I had for Star Wars going forward. I didn't even bother going to see Solo a Star Wars story because of how the Last Jedi turned out.\\n\\nAside from all the plot holes in the Last Jedi\\, the many dropped sub stories that were started in episode 7\\, the forced politicization\\, and all the many other flaws.. \\n\\nThe one big thing that killed it for me was seeing how they treated Luke. They turned the most hopeful Jedi who saw good in the most evil villain the galaxy had ever seen (Vader) into a curmudgeonly old pessimist who hates the Jedi and all their teachings and thinks that he should murder his nephew in his sleep the second he detects a bit of darkness in him. It is nothing short of a complete character assassination of a beloved hero.\\n\\nThen Luke does one fantastic force power (which was cool!) but falls over dead because of it? It made no sense. The entire plot of episode 7 was to find luke before the first order could. When they found him what did the rebels get out of it? No real training\\, no assistance aside from a force hologram that merely delayed the first order for ten minutes or so. That is the extent of this legendary heroes contribution? No.. they are just wiping out the characters we love in order to push us into bland characters that we don't care about.\\n\\nRey is a complete marie sue.","true":true}
