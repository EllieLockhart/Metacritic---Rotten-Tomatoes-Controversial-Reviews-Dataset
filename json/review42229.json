Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie spits on anything sacred about the Star Wars universe. Physics and continity are the first major problem but the characters are used like puppets in an invading forces's play. It's like the neighbor kid from down the street was invited over to play with you and they mess up your cool toy set up. Go home Rian\\, no one wants to play with you.  People who liked this are easily fooled by lame plot twists like a fish that follows a shiny object.","true":true}
