Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow.  What's with all the haters?  Seriously...  Yes\\, it's not one of the revered original trilogy\\, but it's a damn good movie\\, taken on its own merits.  It's not without problems\\, but thoroughly entertaining--I didn't look at my watch once (as I often do).  One star reviewers need to stop taking themselves so seriously\\, grow up\\, get a sense of humor\\, or deal with whatever issue forced the bug so far up their ass.","true":true}
