Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Haters gonna hate but it might be the best Star Wars yet (FOR ORIGINALITY). Sorry to everyone who wanted the same damn story for the 9th time. Rian Johnson is the one who rattled the cages and will not only be remembered for this infamously currently but in time also famously for creating a great piece of art that is the last Jedi. We\u2019re there some plot holes? yes but it\u2019s Star Wars! no one left the theaters thinking this is real and needed the exact science of it. People need to get over Lukes death and move on with the newly established characters.\u270a\ud83c\udffc","true":true}
