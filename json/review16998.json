Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really didn't like this movie. It focused too much on subverting Star Wars tropes\\, and ended up being a bit of a mess. I do have to say that I recommend people see it for themselves before judging\\, but there's a lot to be disappointed in. Without going into too many plot details\\, an arc could've been totally cut out\\, a character could've died\\, another character had no redeeming qualities whatsoever until they died\\, and the tone felt very light for a movie where most of the Resistance dies. Other characters were very well done though\\, so it's not like I hated everything. Beautifully shot as well. Definitely at the bottom of my favorite Star Wars movies\\, and I don't wish to see it again.","true":true}
