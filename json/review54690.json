Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed The Last Jedi.\\nIt subverted some expectations\\, which has clearly annoyed some\\, but I think it was far more enjoyable for it.  And there were a few plot holes and creative liberties but let's be honest here: that's true of every film\\, and we all forgive the films that we enjoyed regardless. And the bottom line is: I left the cinema thinking \\\"that was great!\\\".\\nGreat visuals\\, characters with actual depth and complexity\\, enjoyable action and humorous moments that were genuinely funny.  Highly recommended!","true":true}
