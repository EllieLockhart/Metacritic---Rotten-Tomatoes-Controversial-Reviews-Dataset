We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Let's start with a good one. Great sound\\, musical accompaniment\\, one of the best atmospheres of the overgrown green zombie post-Apocalypse. Great graphics\\, gorgeous locations\\, with wildly beautiful and good detail. Everything is alive and beautiful\\, the weather is great. Models of weapons\\, animations\\, characters\\, infected and textures are photorealistic. Perfect color scheme. It is very interesting to explore the map. And everything except the plot\\, double morals and other things related to the narrative of the plot\\, the plot itself\\, and cheap techniques of playing on the imposed feelings is good. I don't even want to talk about the plot\\, it's just awful. Joel was made a villain\\, even though he saved his daughter from death in the first part\\, though not his own. Because the chance was less than 20 % and the cicadas still wanted to get the vaccine. And given the atrocities they committed\\, they would have used it for their own purposes. Joel is not a fool\\, decided to save Ellie. And now the writers are trying to make him look like a monster\\, making an angel out of (spoiler)\\, even though she's a pure rat. There is also a bunch of moronic plot twists that just killed the plot in the game. So for me\\, it's just a single-player game with no plot\\, running for 30 hours.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
