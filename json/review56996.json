Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible.\\nPorgs showing every 10 seconds?? Disney\\, you dont have to make a movie 2hrs long..Dont use porgs as fillers\\, and please\\, why the \\\"hacker\\\" story when it gets nowhere? Fillers...\\nThe reason why I am giving this bowl of dry shit 2.5 is the ending. This just hit my crap-meter out of this universe.\\nTerrible\\, dont waste money\\, torrent.\\n(I just can not tell you all how disappointing this shit was) :(","true":true}
