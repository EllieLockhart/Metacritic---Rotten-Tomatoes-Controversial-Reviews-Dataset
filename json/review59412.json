If I had to sum this game up in three words they would be \\\"A massive disappointment\\\". Let me get something straight\\, there is nothing wrong with having LGBT characters in a game. In fact we found out of Ellie's sexuality in the DLC for \\\"The Last of Us\\\" that she was gay\\, which is fine. The first game is my absolute favorite game ever and it breaks my heart seeing that they took this route with the second game. They absolutely destroyed everything they built up in the first game within the first 2 hours of this game. The story is absolutely horrendous it was based on hate and the desire for revenge. After the first 5 hours of gameplay I honestly just did not want to play the game anymore. I had to force myself to play this and it pains me because of my excitement for this game to come out\\, just to see Niel just burn everything from the first game down to the floor. The reason I am not giving this game a 0 is because of the graphics and game-play. The graphics are gorgeous and the gameplay is ok. I absolutly hated that Naughty Dog forced me to play half of the game as the character that murdered one of my favorite characters in cold blood. The issue here is what made the first game so amazing was the story\\, that was the important part of both games. The Last of Us has always been about the story. The ending was horrible as well and Neil already said that there are no plans to release a DLC with this game which I see them as saying \\\"there are no plans to fix the story\\\". Like I said earlier in this review\\, I have nothing against them adding LGBT characters in the game but I really felt like Naughty Dog was trying to shove them down my throat\\, like if they were trying to push an agenda through this video game\\, it made me feel like it was less of a video game and more of a political statement which is another reason I think is why most of us gamers dislike the game. Honestly I think this game was a waste of money and a waste of my time. I just really hope that if they do make a third game or a TV show\/movie they don't use Abbey as the protagonist\\, she is the most hated character in the game... that will definitely be the final nail in the coffin for us fanatics of the franchise.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
