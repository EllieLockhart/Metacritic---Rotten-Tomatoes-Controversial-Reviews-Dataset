Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At every turn\\, this movie burns the Internet's painfully mundane fan theories and all expectations in a glorious\\, iconoclastic rage. From the ashes\\, director Rian Johnson creates the most distinctive Star Wars film ever made\\, and the greatest after Empire. From exploring the mysteries of the Force\\, to critiquing the dualism of good and evil\\, to subverting everything we've come to expect of lightsaber duels and space warfare\\, this movie was pure filmmaking magic. \\n\\nThat the \\\"audience\\\" score is low is probably a good thing. This is a country that voted for Trump and wants to live in the 1840s. They want remakes of the originals and nothing more.","true":true}
