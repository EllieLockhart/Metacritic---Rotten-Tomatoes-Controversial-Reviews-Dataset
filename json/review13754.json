Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Kylo Ren characterization at the \\\"Force Awakens\\\" was weak\\, it is sad to see the same low performance at the \\\"Last Jedi\\\"\\, portraiting a childish attitude of what should be a lot more intelligent and profound one.  The movie left me with a sence of being also \\\"very low budget\\\".  The Director does not take any advantage on Daisy Ridley's strong personallity for which I was expecting a lot:  Rey is oddly portraited and so passive - no emotions whatsoever.  It is hard to see if the next movie will be anything close to \\\"good\\\"\\, now that all the good actors and emotionally strong characters are gone.","true":true}
