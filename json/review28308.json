Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor storytelling\/writing. Killed off all the intriguing elements carried over from \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" and many from the original trilogy\\, as well. Too many cheap \\\"at the very last second escape\\\" moments. Unnecessary subplot with the whole casino planet debacle. No desire to see the sequel now and THAT'S saying something.","true":true}
