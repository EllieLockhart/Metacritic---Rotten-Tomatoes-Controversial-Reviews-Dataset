Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an avid Star Wars fan. I loved this movie. The movie exceeded all of my expectations. Every actor and actress was incredibly amazing. Adam Driver especially excelled in his nuanced portrayal of a tormented villain. I did not expect anything that that happened; however\\, I can understand why Rian Johnson would take this third trilogy in this direction. This movie shows how evil and good\\, the light side and the dark side\\, is not necessarily so clearly defined. The Last Jedi shows how even the good guys are not always correct in their choices or actions. And\\, the movie shows how sometimes the force is not always with you. This movie was about sacrifice\\, humility\\, compassion\\, and perseverance rather than glory. I  look forward to the the next Star Wars movie.","true":true}
