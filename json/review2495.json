Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A visually stunning film\\, but very lacking in plot and character development. It seems that Rian Johnson\\, in his trying to make a non-derivative Star Wars movie\\, has done a disservice to the old and new characters in the franchise.\\n\\nThe fans were looking for answers to the myriad of questions that have been asked in The Force Awakens\\, but Johnson leaves us with even more questions-nothing is answered.\\n\\nI saw both The Force Awakens and Rogue One in theatres twice\\, I will not be seeing The Last Jedi a second time in theatres.","true":true}
