Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I think about this film\\, the less I like it. The script is full of holes and highly illogical decisions. The dialogue is not great\\, the action is dull and tired\\, the ending is unsatisfactory and the new characters are obnoxious and politically charged. \\n\\nMark Hamill does a great job as Luke\\, but his character is highly contradictory to the Luke Skywalker of the past. The things he does in this film are things the George Lucas Luke would never do. \\n\\nThis film was crap as an adventure film and really just a slow war movie in space. I expected more. Kylo Ren was pretty good and I like the character more. I like Rey a little bit more\\, as well.","true":true}
