{"101487":147153,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched the Last Jedi this last weekend and have to say\\, it's simply the most complex\\, most fleshed out and most introspective entry to the Star Wars universe. For me\\, it's finally unseated The Empire Strikes Back as my favorite Star Wars movie. The emotional and spiritual turmoil of the Force wielder is raw. Mark Hamill encapsulates the legend\\, the hero and the flawed human being so well\\, I have to wonder why he hasn't done more movies.\\nThe first act was typical space battle fare with Po Dameron effectively taking the title of best X-Wing fighter pilot ever and crushing it. Carrie Fisher acted the best Princess Leia ever. In fact\\, all the characters introduced were complex\\, complicated individuals. \\nI laughed a lot in this movie\\, because I have to assume it is the new standard that Disney movies have to maintain. Thanks\\, Marvel! There were moments of genuine awe as well. I was intrigued and surprised on some levels. Even being a movie aficionado and Force Sensitive geek didn't prepare me for the plot twists and surprises. This movie is not simple....at all. If you want that\\, you will not be happy. If you wanted something brainless\\, you will not be happy. If you expected a wrapped-up-with-a-bow happy ending\\, you will DEFINITELY not be happy.\\nThe running themes in this movie are about hope\\, failure\\, unpredictability and even more failure. And I loved all of it. Hardly ever does a movie come along that has everything go wrong and still leave you anxious for the next installment.\\nAnd Rian Johnson\\, the writer and director of this epic masterpiece. I have to paraphrase the words of T'Challa\\, in the upcoming\\, sure to be awesome\\, Avengers Infinity War\\, \\\"Somebody give this man another movie!\\\" He is the truth. I love that he isn't afraid to trash our heroes. In fact\\, the reality is that our heroes are never as spotless as we make them to be. And that reality should make us love them more because they overcome in spite of their flaws and failures. \\nBut yeah\\, I laughed\\, oohed\\, cried and jumped through this movie. In my estimation\\, this is the moment when Star Wars finally grew up. The old chapter\\, great as it has been\\, was closed and a new one has begun. Thank you\\, George Lucas for birthing the concept. But your baby is all grown up now. And yeah\\, Yoda will never die.","true":true}
