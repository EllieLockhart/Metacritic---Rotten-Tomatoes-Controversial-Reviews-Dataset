Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER REVIEW\\n\\nI never write movie reviews but seeing as this movie gets so much negativity thrown at it\\, I need to hop in and join the fight\\, help push the needle back to where it belongs.\\n\\nStar Wars The Last Jedi is a great Star Wars movie. Counting in its visual effects\\, dynamics and story I could almost say it is the best one yet. Sure\\, there are some things that disappointed me like the casino scenes\\, Captain Phasmas pointlessness and the fact that Snoke died so fast and we don't know anything about him. But I like the way Luke's character took course. He was never properly prepared to run an academy and train jedis alone. I can understand his frustration\\, also looking at the fact that they still can't catch a break from the bad guys. In a bigger picture I would have preferred the restored republic storyline from EU\\, but now that the decision has been taken and The First Order appeared\\, we can't let wishful thinking destroy our enjoyment of the story. The new characters are great and the actors are doing an awesome job. This movie finally avoids repetition and cliches and surprises us with twists and turns\\, some challenging to accept.\\nSo please Star Wars Fans\\, grow up and look at it from outside the box. Kids love it\\, the same way you did when you were young. So stop complaining and accept that this is canon and the EU has to mould around the movies\\, as always. Nostalgia has blinded you.","true":true}
