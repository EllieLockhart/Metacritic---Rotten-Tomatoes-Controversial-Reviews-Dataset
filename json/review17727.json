Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It craps on everything that came before it. Even the movie that this is a sequel to. They cared more about getting their political agenda across than telling a good story\\, and can someone tell me why Rian Johnson has a hard on for not fulfilling on set ups? Everything that is set up in the force awakens and even in this movie is just never brought to justice. The have star is for shirtless Kylo Ren\\, I know the scene was useless and dumb but my boy is a straight beef cake.","true":true}
