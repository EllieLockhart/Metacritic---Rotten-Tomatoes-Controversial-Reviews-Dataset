Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning. RJ should stay a DP or 1st AD. Leave the writing to others. Aside from the bad character choices\\, and being completely tone deaf\\, at it's core it's just bad story-telling. There were a few cool moments\\, but I wish JJ did this one too\\, at least it would have been his complete story. This is the worst of the Skywalker Saga movies. I pray Lucasfilm never lets Rian Johnson touch anything else in the universe.","true":true}
