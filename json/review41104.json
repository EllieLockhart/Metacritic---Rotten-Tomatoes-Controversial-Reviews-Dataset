Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had potential to be great but they made Luke irrelevant\\, ignored the plot line JJ Abrams set up in Force Awakens\\, and tried to make gender equality statements at the expense of character development. When you take liberties with a movie franchise to pander to a certain group\\, you lose the true fans who have supported the franchise for 40 years.","true":true}
