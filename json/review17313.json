Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to love this\\, but it was too campy. A lot of the story line made no sense or was useless. They took the build up of mystery from the Force Awakens and dumped it. The writing was sloppy\\, the directing was sloppy. It felt very hamfisted. The best parts of the movie could be contained within 15 minutes. One particular fight scene is by far the best in the film and the rest completely fails to impress or make any sense at all.","true":true}
