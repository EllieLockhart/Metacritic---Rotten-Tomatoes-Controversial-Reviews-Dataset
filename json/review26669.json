Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"OK\\, it doesn't have Jar Jar Binks\\, so it isn't the worst movie of the franchise\\, but it certainly is not one of the best.

The action flits back and forth between sub-plots and results in a very choppy movie.  I enjoyed it in the theatre when I watched it the first time\\, despite the problems.  The video revealed the film's flaws when watched a second time.  As Yuri Karpov says in 2012: \\\"Not Good\\\"","true":true}
