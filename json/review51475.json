Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete and unexpected twist of the sequel trilogy and some of its characters\\, and I mean not only their actions but also the development that each of the characters present. It will generate you different emotions and thoughts through the film about everything you thought you knew or imagined about what would happen or the characters and even the ones you knew before this new trilogy.","true":true}
