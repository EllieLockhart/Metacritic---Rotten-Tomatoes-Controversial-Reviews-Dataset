Everything u liked and loved about these characters is **** on . They act out of character and are made unlikable just 2 push the plot and introduce a new playable character(which she sucks BTW). Besides the fact this character model looks ridiculous there is no setup to make u care about this person at all. Just because we dont like the games story and new character were being called bigots and phobes when all we wanted was a good ending to some of our favorite characters in any media is sad.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
