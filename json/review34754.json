Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The devil is in the details\\, the mistimed \\\"humor\\\" detracts from the story. The detailing in the sience was faulty since when in any Star Wars film does ENERGY lasers Arc due too gravity in space. Stagnant plot line and meaningless additional plot. Save yourself and don't see it in theatres.","true":true}
