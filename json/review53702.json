Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun movie worth seeing\\, but honestly\\, not that well written. It squanders nearly every single emotionally poignant moment it's building up to\\, or mutes it in some way. At times they take an awesome scene and then decide to ruin it for the sake of some less interesting story thread. (In one case literally building up to an awesome big battle\\, with people taking big risks for the battle\\, but then deciding out of the blue \\\"this isn't going to work\\, let's abort the whole battle for the sake of a romantic scene.\\\")\\n\\nIt just didn't feel like a very coherent story. I think the surprising thing is that the critics loved it so much\\, not that the audiences thought it was merely okay. However\\, it's a fun movie still and worth seeing. It reminded me a lot Man of Steel or BvS with Zach Snyder at the helm -- some interesting (even ingenious) story ideas poorly executed\\, but at least the action scenes were fun. Disney needs to hire Brandon Sanderson or Josh Whedon to improve the writing and keep the franchise from going the way of those DC movies. Also\\, terrible handling of Luke Skywalker's character.","true":true}
