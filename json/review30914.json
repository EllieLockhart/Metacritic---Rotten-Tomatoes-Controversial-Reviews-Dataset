Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So consumed with their social agenda\\, the \\\"talent\\\" behind Star Wars has no desire to make movies for all to enjoy. If I wanted a two-hour-plus lecture on feminism\\, the evils of capitalism and eating meat\\, I would have downloaded some TED talks.\\n\\nEven if you accept all the social messaging\\, the movie is horribly written and edited. Dumb one-liners. Mary Poppins. The third act is way too long\\, has too many false endings\\, and has too many new characters all scrambling around competing for our awe and attention. No thanks.","true":true}
