Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really terrible.  Worst starwars movie except possibly episode 2. Seriously\\, it is that bad.  Don't waste your money. \\nPlot holes for days. So many forced\\, bad\\, unfunny quips. Rey has no real training but is still super overpowered at everything.  The new female character (rose) is forgettable and doesn't make any sense why she is involved in the film at all.  Nothing Finn does makes a damn bit of difference and princess lea flies through space in the worst CG of the film.  \\nAbsolutely terrible.","true":true}
