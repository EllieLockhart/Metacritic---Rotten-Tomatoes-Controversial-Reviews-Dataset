Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the single worst Star Wars film to date\\, including the prequels. And this is coming from someone that deeply enjoyed TFA. It didn't even feel like a Star Wars film\\, it felt like a weird fever dream. There was so much in this movie that didn't make sense in the context of the rest of the series. If you must watch it\\, wait for it to come out on DVD.","true":true}
