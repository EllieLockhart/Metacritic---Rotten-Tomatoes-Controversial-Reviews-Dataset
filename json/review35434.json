Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi could well have been called The Last Star Wars. The disrespect shown to the classic characters and to the Star Wars mythology is astounding. The loosy-goosy\\, poorly written\\, new characters do very little to save the proceedings. The principals lack the characterization and punch that the originals had in spades. It is impossible to recommend this movie. TFA mortally wounded the saga; this one just plainly killed it. A disgrace.","true":true}
