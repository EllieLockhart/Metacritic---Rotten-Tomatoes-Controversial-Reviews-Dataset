Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't get the hate for this movie from many fans.  I grew up with the original trilogy and suffered through the prequels.  This wasn't a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination but it was entertaining and to me\\, fit just fine in the Star Wars universe.  \\n\\nIt is not an easy task to move past the iconic characters of the past but for the franchise to move forward it has to.\\n\\nWill be interesting to see what JJ Abrams does with episode 9.","true":true}
