Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of the movie seems almost intentionally symbolic of Rian Johnson callously dismantling much of the classic Star Wars ethos.\\n\\n\\\"Let the past die; kill it if you have to.\\\"\\n\\nA lot of the story doesn't go the way you might expect... Sometimes this is a good thing\\, but in TLJ the plot and sub-plots don't really make much sense\\, particularly when accounting for the context established by previous films.\\n\\nI have loved Star Wars for over 20 years but this was a massive disappointment for me; feels like a deep betrayal of the franchise's history and groundwork.\\nOthers may like it... obviously.\\nMaybe I've lost touch. That's fine.\\nI USED TO BE WITH IT. But then they changed what IT was. Now what I'm with isn't IT\\, and what's IT seems weird and scary to me... IT'LL HAPPEN TO YOUUUU!!!\\n\\n\\nSpecific criticisms (some degree of spoiler-ing):\\n- Boring\\, seemingly pointless intermediate narrative\\n- Feels designed to undo the setting-up of The Force Awakens in favour of some new vision for the franchise... this is probably why it's 2.5 hours long. It cuts off a lot of great potential established by TFA and hastily introduces a new confusing context for episode 9... can't say more without spoiling a lot.\\n- Has no regard for the established characters of the series - they are unbelievably atypical of themselves. Much of the story is caused by one particular character being very uncharacteristic for a brief moment...\\n- Snoke's praetorian guards behave like Power Rangers. It looks stupid.\\n- The inconsistency of power levels is frustrating. In TFA\\, Kylo Ren could stop blaster bolts mid-air and incapacitate people with his mind. In TLJ\\, he is barely a swordsman.\\n- Rey's story is a huge disappointment. Even if it's just a setup for surprises in episode 9\\, it was still unexciting in TLJ.\\n- Lots of dumb decisions\\, or tedious indecision\\, from characters made the narrative unbearably drawn out and frustrating. 3 hours of this.\\n- Most of the narrative is about buying time or waiting. It's boring\\, and frustratingly unrealistic. 3 hours of this.\\n- Captain Phasma is the new Boba Fett.\\n- The porgs are as gimmicky as Jar-Jar-Binks and painfully irrelevant.\\n- More Maz Kanata\\, also painfully irrelevant... and just naturally painful.\\n- Surprise romance story that has no depth.\\n- Easily foreseen betrayal by obviously traitorous character surprises everyone.\\n- No compelling cinematography\\, especially compared to TFA.\\n- Social Justice Warrior side-quest in the midst of urgent main plot point feels out of place and foolish\\, is not believable\\, has some pretty lame dialogue\\, and seemingly has the protagonists forget they are a vital part of a life-or-death mission.\\n\\n\\nGood stuff:\\n- Some parts of the script that were intended to be funny were indeed funny.","true":true}
