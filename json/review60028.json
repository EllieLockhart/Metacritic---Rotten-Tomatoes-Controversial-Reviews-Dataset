I borrowed my friends PS and actually went through it twice. Beautiful graphics that really pushed the boundaries of the gen\\, engaging characters who I grew to love and an amazing story with the perfect end.

Beautiful graphics that really pushed the boundaries of the gen\\, engaging characters who I grew to love and an amazing story with the perfect end. So when I heard they were making Part 2 I was nervous where they\u2019d take these characters... While this game is very beautiful the gameplay doesn\u2019t feel much different from the first game\\, which isn\u2019t a bad thing but it does become very repetitive and gets quite boring when you\u2019re exploring these needlessly big areas full of loot. The gunplay is still quite janky and the stealth kills very quickly become a rinse and repeat process. The main problem with this game is the absolute butchery and bastardisation of the characters and story we have come to love. Within the first 2 hours we see the beloved Joel beaten to death by Abby while Ellie watches sending her on a rage fuelled revenge mission. Not only does Joel and Tommy save Abby when they randomly stumble across her in a blizzard\\, they disregard all the things they learnt from the first game when they trustingly wander into an unknown camp and introduce themselves. It\u2019s a hard first few hours and if you manage to get past the sudden betrayal of Joel you\u2019d think the worst is over\\, but it is far from over... The game sends you as Ellie on this revenge mission to kill Abby and her followers and you spend the next few hours exploring and cutting people down left and right\\, before you\u2019re forced to play as Abby for what seems like far too long\\, in hope that you\u2019ll understand and reason with her of why this random npc caved Joel\u2019s skull in. The end is where you truly lose all hope for this game. Ellie has lost friends and killed hundreds on her hunt for Abby\\, as she finally fights her and loses a few fingers in the process she has a flashback of Joel and now decides revenge is bad... letting Abby go. I mean seriously?! What? It seems that this really all was for nothing. Ellie returns home\\, a couple of fingers down and short a good few friends and lover and you sit and think what the hell have I accomplished over the last 25 hours? It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if in part 3\\, Abby digs up Joel\u2019s corpse and **** him before giving the finger to the camera and dabbing. Do yourselves a favour\\, don\u2019t play this betrayal. We deserved better.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
