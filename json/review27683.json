Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pay no mind to the negative drivel that some of the audience has chosen to leave here. The movie is large\\, fun\\, and it's theme is one we all have to learn in life and is the biggest key to success. Failure. Luke failed Ben\\, Rose and Finn fail their mission on Canto Bight\\, Snoke fails to see Kylo's true intentions\\, Hux fails the FO\\, Liea fails the Resistance\\, etc. We can redeem ourselves by understanding our failures and this movie\\, despite a few angry fans that have taken to the Internet to sport their woes\\, is far from a failure. 4.5\/5","true":true}
