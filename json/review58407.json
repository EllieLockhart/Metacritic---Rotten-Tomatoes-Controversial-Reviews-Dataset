Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After waited for 2 years I saw the latest Star Wars movie The Last Jedi.  It did not draw me in like the last movie.  It ruined some of the most iconic characters for me.  That was really really dump how it was ended.  I was like WTF?  The story was average and characters were just running around like headless chickens.  I left the theater with disappointment and thought to myself this series just needed to end.  To me it is going down the road like EP 1-3.  Rogue One was so much better.","true":true}
