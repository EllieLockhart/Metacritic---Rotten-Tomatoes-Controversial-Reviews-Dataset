Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's nice to have some humor injected into what is actually a pretty dark movie. Not as dark as Empire\\, but still pretty dark. Despite a couple of WTF moments\\, Rain Johnson has delivered a worthy addition to the franchise. ","true":true}
