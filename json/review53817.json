Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great.

Moreover\\, the blending of the old characters and the new was very well done\\, with the feeling that the torch had been passed to the new generation.\\n\\nUnfortunately\\, Episode VIII doesn't come close to the engagement\\, novelty and adventure of Episode VII.  Its essentially one long action-drama\\, with little in the way of engagement or originality.  The Rey-Kylo Ren relationship had potential but went nowhere new or interesting and was snuffed out pretty quickly.  Them possibly working together held my attention but the intrigue was short-lived.  The movie simply degenerated into action sequences after that.\\n\\nOn the upside\\, no need to waste my time on Episode IX (Or X\\, or XI\\, or...)...","true":true}
