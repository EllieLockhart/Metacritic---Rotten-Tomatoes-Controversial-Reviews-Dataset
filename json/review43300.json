Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a good and entertaining film. Very nice cinema and pretty good acting. With that being said. This may be one of the worst Star Wars films ever. Luke uses the force in ways that hasn't been used in any other film\\, The entire story of Finn and Rose was beyond boring and had little to do with anything else in the film\\, and at no point in all of my time being a Star Wars fan did I need the question answered as to where the Empire or Rebellion were getting their weapons. If you are not a Star Wars fan and want some mindless entertainment...you might like this. If you are a long time Star Wars fan...just watch Rogue One again. You will be much more satisfied than whatever Rian Johnson is trying to achieve with this disaster or storytelling.","true":true}
