Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Actually painful to watch and a right mess of a film. Fails miserably to capture the heart and feel of the original trilogy in any way. I feel so sorry for Mark Hamill. \\n\\nI won't go on. But in light of the BS reviews by the critics (not a scrap of professional credibility between them) I wanted to add my voice here.","true":true}
