Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw that this was getting a lot of conflicted reviews and thought I'd add my drop to the bucket.\\nThere was definitely more Soap Opera in my Space Opera than I'm used to\\, but that's not bad. The movie may have been long\\, but it certainly didn't feel so.\\nThe main plot involving Rey\\, Luke\\, Kylo\\, and Snoke is phenomenal in my opinion and caries absolutely everything I love and expect in a star wars film. The whole Finn and Rose side adventure thing was admittedly a bit more on the nose at times than it needed to be\\, and I do honestly think that whole thread could have been done away with\\, but what else are you gonna have our beloved Finn do\\, huh?\\nThe whole running out of fuel and slowly watching the Rebellion die ship by ship as they ran\\, the on the ship tension between the leadership\\, and all that I thought was really good and I enjoyed it.\\nJust the whole Finn and Rose excursion was narratively unnecessary\\, but was at least still a good time.","true":true}
