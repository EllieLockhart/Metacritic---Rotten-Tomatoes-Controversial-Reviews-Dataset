Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does two things terribly inexcusable beyond terrible plot holes and not even respecting the storyline from the previous film. One the producer and I blame the producer on both these points. The producer decides to lay down a gauntlet of political points of view effectively making this a odd out of place political propaganda film. The force awakens touched on one point and quickly moved on. When Rey didn't need a man to be helped up but the man eventually took her hand. I was like sure ok. That's fine. That's great let's remind young girls in the audience you are bad ass. Good stuff. Two. They destroyed Luke Skywalker and made him a coward and someone who is willing to do something so out of character. Don't want to spoil it. I won't watch another Star Wars film after this total betrayal to the fan base. I've read the books\\, played the games\\, watched the movies with my kids. I'm been fan from before I knew anything about anything. I idolized these characters. Disney stepped over the line by destroying core characters to advance their new ones. It's sad and unnecessary and for that they are nothing more then bad fan fiction.","true":true}
