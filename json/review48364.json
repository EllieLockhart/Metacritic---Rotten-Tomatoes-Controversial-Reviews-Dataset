Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Will we look back years from now and recognize this as the movie that killed Star Wars? I think it's a real possibility. \\n\\nThere were positives: good jokes\\, good acting\\, some cool scenes and plot points. \\n\\nBut the negatives--oh the negatives--which we can all but fit under a single umbrella; that being: the misuse and seeming disrespect of the characters\\, mythology and spirit of the movies that came before (including The Force Awakens). Kylo Ren is perhaps the only character that does not fall under this category (unless you consider the Porgs and Droids as characters). The rest were poorly handled.\\n\\nDon't get me started on Luke Skywalker. His first reaction to having a lightsaber in his hand again was to throw it away like a piece of garbage. Unfortunately\\, that moment was symbolic of the movie as a whole.\\n\\nI am not suggesting that Rian Johnson intentionally set out to disrespect (destroy?) Star Wars. Or to make a bad movie. But we all make mistakes... this movie was a mistake.","true":true}
