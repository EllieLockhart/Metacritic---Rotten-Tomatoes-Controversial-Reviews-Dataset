Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to the haters. This is a great movie and a worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise. The acting is fantastic\\, the story is suspenseful and gripping. I really have no idea why so many people don't want to like it. It's better than the prequel movies\\, that's for sure.","true":true}
