We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"You're giving a playable\\, and really well polished game a 0? Are you kidding me? If you hate only the story\\, you're still giving it a 0 huh? wtf dude. Oh btw\\, NEVER TRUST THE USER REVIEWS THAT ARE POSTED ON THE RELEASE DAY. You tell me you've finished this game in under 24 hours? What a joke.Story is way different than the first\\, it made you think so hard what will happen next\\, and itYou're giving a playable\\, and really well polished game a 0? Are you kidding me? If you hate only the story\\, you're still giving it a 0 huh? wtf dude. Oh btw\\, NEVER TRUST THE USER REVIEWS THAT ARE POSTED ON THE RELEASE DAY. You tell me you've finished this game in under 24 hours? What a joke.Story is way different than the first\\, it made you think so hard what will happen next\\, and it gets more complex due to the amount of important characters in this game. The story may be divisive especially about the controversy regarding death on a few characters. BUT\\, if you judge it objectively and stop thinking selfishly that how the story continue SHOULD be the same as how you want it to be\\, i'm pretty sure you will like it.A lot of creative environment puzzles (in fact\\, there's a lot of em)\\, can't believe i read a review and he\/she said that the puzzles are gone and he\/she has played the game. dude\\, stop review bombing.Graphics is amazing\\, it's the most beautiful game this generation imo. Frame rate is really stable (locked 30) and the animation is godly.It's okay if you hate LGBT but please don't let it divert your opinions on the game. Just stop.Gameplay is SO MUCH FUN if you really like the feeling of being hunted\\, or hard stealth game. It's way harder to stealth just because of the introduction of dogs and how big the areas are with much more smarter AI and better vision for the enemies. The human enemies are diverse as well!Don't believe the lies. When you're lost in darkness\\, look for the light.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
