Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to see light saber battles\\, space battles that actually make sense\\, a strong villain and a meaningfull plot.\\n\\nInstead we got gender wars\\, a movie that pushes all kind of agendas I never had a problem with nor I'm interested in. This movie doesn't even deserve half a star\\, but since RT doesn't count half stars\\, here have one from me\\, and that is way to generous for you Ryan and Kathleen. Please go away and never come back...","true":true}
