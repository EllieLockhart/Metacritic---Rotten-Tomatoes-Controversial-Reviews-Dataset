Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had great potential\\, yet they just took a dump on the legacy and filled it with plotholes. If Ep9 doesn't redeem this movie by explaining some of the shenanigans\\, I would say this is worse than Ep1 A Phantom Menace","true":true}
