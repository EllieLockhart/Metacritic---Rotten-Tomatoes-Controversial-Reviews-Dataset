Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I finally saw a star wars movie I actually liked. I was pretty comfortable with nearly everything and I thought that the director along with the crew did a fantastic job. I studied art and read some books (unrelated to star wars)\\, and I was honestly in the right mindset to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it because my family and I had a good time watching this film. It's a movie about family and philosophy and it might or might not stand the test of time\\, but I approve of the films message. thanks guys.","true":true}
