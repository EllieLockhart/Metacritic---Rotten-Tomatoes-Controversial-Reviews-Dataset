Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw the first Star Wars movie when I was 10.  It was my favorite series of all time.  My kids play with my old star wars figures now.  My summer college job was working in ODV at Disneyland.  The Last Jedi is the Disneyifcation of the story line into a tragic kingdom version that doesn't capture the mystery\\, challenge and call to the light or dark. \\n\\nI went to see TLJ  twice in the theater\\, to hope I would like it the second time.  I really wanted to like these new versions\\, but I am afraid my fandom may not survive the Disney era.  I am saddened to see the slow demise of this epic series into whatever story fits the themes of today.  There goes the timeless value of the Star Wars worldview.\\n\\nThe final ending with the boy force pulling the broom to clean the stables just reminded me this was targeting the Disney customer base\\, 8-14 year-olds.","true":true}
