Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too much comedy and pretty much a major let down coming off of the build-up from The Force Awakens. Luke's legacy and the Original Trilogy will come across as disrespected to loyal Star Wars that witnessed the originals years ago. I now understand Mark Hamill's feelings on how he disagreed on the way the producers were taking Luke Skywalker. Sadly\\, this new Star Wars Film is a product of its time\\, pressing agendas like class warfare\\, ethnic diversity\\, feminism\\, animal activism. They should have made a new trilogy outside of the original characters and story line to do the things they have done with this movie.","true":true}
