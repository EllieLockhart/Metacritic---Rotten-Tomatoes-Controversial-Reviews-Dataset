{"101487":163000,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-05","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty awfull. If Rei hated her bad heritage\\, and so decided to join kylo into the darkside\\, and you ended it there by skipping the salt mine planet BS\\, which did nothing except tick the \\\"Luke does cool thing\\\" box\\, then it would have been the daring twist you kept telling yourself it was (and also be a movie with set up and pay-off). Otherwise\\, its the most bland star wars movie where nothing happened\\, the rebels are outnumbered\\, they're broke\\, and are losing? Ok so I could just skip the film then\\, because every character with a face or name is still alive\\, except for snoke\\, and luke\\, both of whom die for no reason and without any drama btw. WTF lol\\, luke dies from concentrating so hard!?!?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? \\nObi-wan and yoda were in hiding because they were wanted fugitives hunted by the empire\\, Luke goes into hiding because he tries to kill his own nephew\\, no explanation\\, just he \\\"sensed darkness\\\"\\, ok\\, maybe notice that before teaching him how to sword fight? not that training matters at all apparently. When that murder attempt (he thought for just a second so its okay\\, no rewrites needed\\, god you lazy fuck) ends in disaster he goes into hiding because the \\\"jedi have hubris\\\"\\, WHAT? thats not even a logical A to B story\\, and its all like that\\, nothing leads to the other. \\nThis killed the trilogy\\, now force awakens makes no sense\\, and you have an incredibly dumb second movie\\, you're basically starting from scratch in the third movie\\, if its good\\, which i doubt\\, it will end up just being a good stand alone film\\, there was no point to anything so far basically. A steaming pile of doo-doo\\nGood luck JJ\\, we all know how good you are at making good endings\\, LOL. Just have kylo and rei hookup\\, and the first order (still no explanation to what they are or where they came from\\, just \\\"out of the ashes rose the first order\\\" HUH?) and i guess the first order just explodes? people parade and dance and hug\\, the good guys say \\\"we did it\\\" force ghost luke OMFG theres going to be a force ghost luke isnt there\\, WHY? Ahh yes rei\\, my student all the things i taught you\\, like........when i watched you teach yourself how to use a lightsaber. lolol fuck you disney\\, this is not a sequel trilogy of \\\"what happens next\\\" this is you just remixing the same plot and doing it way way way worse lol\\, all for a quick buck\\, good luck with the han solo solo film\\, im sure that will be the final nail in the coffin and people will wake up to this facade\\, the dream is dead everyone\\, just remember the good movies and move on","true":true}
