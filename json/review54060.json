Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'd give it 0 stars if I could.  I left the theater defeated and conflicted\\, because technically\\, audio-wise and visually\\, it is perfect.  However\\, after reflecting on much of the story\\, the story not only makes no sense in terms of the Star Wars universe\\, but there is literally no character development in this movie.  A lot of characters are killed before learning anything about them.  The stupid communications between Poe and Hux in the beginning was cringe.  Leia flying through space was probably the most disappointing.  \\n\\nStar Wars The Last Jedi is what you get when participation trophy kids begin making movies.  You get unadulterated mediocrity.  This was a calculated move for Disney\\, as they knew it didn't matter what they produced\\, it would sell tickets on namesake alone.  This movie was a straight middle finger to the real Star Wars fans\\, showing us that they can destroy what we love and get paid ludicrous amounts of money to do so.  Look at Mark Hamill in this video:  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9sq0jMeAUzM  That is the look of a man that has lived his life as Luke friggin' Skywalker\\, and here this Rian Johnson comes along\\, rips out Luke Skywalker's heart and shoves it right down Mark Hamill's neck.  Stop rewarding mediocrity.?","true":true}
