{"101487":174776,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The hardcore Star Wars geekazoids appear to be polarised on the merits of The Last Jedi but when I was young\\, Star Wars was a space opera with elements of fantasy and mythology- like Flash Gordon with groundbreaking special effects. It was entertaining escapism and most of all\\, rollicking good fun! \\nThe nerd-verse it has become today grew out of the generation of kids in the '90s who didn't want to be Trekkies or Whovians\\, kind of dug the X Files and probably fantasized in chat rooms about Princess Leia in a slave girl outfit- under the nome de plume of Jabba the Slut of course.\\nWell then\\, bravo to director Rian Johnson for doing the unthinkable- Shaking up the Star Wars universe like a snow-float without cracking the glass! Unlike the previous entry The Force Awakens which gave us a highly spirited\\, yet retro mix-tape of the original trilogy\\, this is a movie that will shatter preconceptions about established characters and the very mythology of the Force- especially concerning the psychic and telepathic possibilities of that galactic mysticism ( the superb interplay between Rey and Kylo Ren). In terms of the twists and possibilities we are presented with here\\, the franchise is at long last saying something new (assuming that our earth timeline is roughly concurring with that galaxy far far away!). Yes\\, there are similarities with Marvel films and the Harry Potter franchise (especially the final chapter). Dr Who millennials may also spot a wink or two in their direction\\, but The Last Jedi is still undeniably a Star Wars movie\\, and a stunning one at that.\\nAbove all\\, it is simply stellar film-making (and I tried to like those flat\\, sterilized prequels\\, I really did!). It's a beautifully shot movie which thankfully\\, doesn't just dump actors in vomit-inducing green screen environments with the direction cue \\\"Faster\\, more intensity\\\". Rian Johnson is a director who cares about actors\\, cliches and how to avoid them\\, and best of all\\, he cares about Star Wars.\\nAs with the bombshell of Han Solo's death in the previous film\\, if we want sequels to the classic trilogy\\, we can't expect our childhood to be released from carbon freeze without a few wrinkles. Luke Skywalker is now a hermit living in Siddhartha-like exile with no comfort but his own guilt over the failed Jedi training of Ben Solo and-quite justifiably- wants nothing to do with Rey and her rebel rescue missions. This is quite possibly Mark Hamill's most memorable performance in the series and likewise\\, Carrie Fisher exudes stately maturity in her untimely swan-song as the galactic princess. \\nElsewhere\\, Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) are in good form and Poe (Oscar Isaac) is thankfully given more to do than in The Force Awakens. Newcomers Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and the always lovely Laura Dern also impress and fit quite comfortably into the Star Wars universe. What kept me guessing as a viewer and as a fan (nostalgist and realist) was the way that seemingly inconsequential plot points had a revealing logic and purpose only moments later. What a clever movie this is and although it does take more than a few cues from The Empire Strikes Back with the narrative\\, the reluctance to play it safe has paid off handsomely. Luke sums the movie up with the words \\\"This is not gonna go the way you think\\\".","true":true}
