Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode I was the first Star Wars movie on the big screen and I actually enjoyed the prequels. Then Disney bought Star Wars. At first I though \\\"Great! New movies\\, finally!\\\" Then I saw The Force Awakens and was rather disappointed. But nothing prepared me for the disappointment that was The Last Jedi. The movie is utter crap\\, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In comparison to that\\, The Force Awakens is a masterpiece despite being bad itself. The Last Jedi is so bad I couldn't believe my eyes when I first watched it. I watched it for a second time\\, thinking that maybe it might be better once I was over my initial disappointment. But no\\, still crap. The story of this movie makes no sense. Is that really Star Wars? I can't believe it. At least I didn't waste money to actually watch this in theater. Rather than having me pay to see this\\, the director should pay me for putting up with this garbage! I doubt I will even watch Episode 9. On the other hand\\, Episode 9 could hardly be worse than Episode 8. Or so I hope.","true":true}
