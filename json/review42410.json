Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a complete disapointment for me. However\\, If your the type of person that likes action and can ignore plot holes watch it.\\nThis movie was insulting to the Star wars universe\\, unoriginal and makes the force awakens even worse. The movie trashes who Luke Skywalker was in the return of the jedi. KYLO is a whinny punk who temper tantrums his way thru the film and you never buy into him as a bad guy to fear. the first order is an army of stooges who can't seem to get things right. REY faces no obstacles and forrest gumps her way on this adventure... oh and DISNEY feels the need to throw their two cents on current day affairs in sci fi fantasy. This is the only place i could vote to showcase my displeasure of Star wars DISNEY. I won't see IX.  \\nIt","true":true}
