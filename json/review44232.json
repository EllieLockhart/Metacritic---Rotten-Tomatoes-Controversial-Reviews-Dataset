Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Took everything JJ Abrams paved and threw it straight in the trash. Say what you want about the Empire\\, but at least  they had their sh** together. You respected them. Now... Kylo Ren\\, the torn\\, moody teenager is the SUPREME LEADER? Pass. Also\\, thanks to Rian Johnson and Disney for completely destroying the legacy of Luke Skywalker. Since about 1977 we've been waiting to see Luke shine as the Grand Master of all Grand Master of all Grand Master Jedi. This was supposed to be it - and Johnson & co didn't even try. Too bad.","true":true}
