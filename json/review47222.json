Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a pathetic piece of space-junk this movie was. Congrats Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy for taking a historic franchise and burying it under a blanket of social justice and political correctness. I gave it ONLY 1 star because rumor has it if you give a 1\/2 star this site doesn't count it.","true":true}
