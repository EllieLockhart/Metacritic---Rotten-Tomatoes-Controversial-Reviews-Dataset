Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I agree with most people that the social justice aspect of this movie was fairly sickening.  I also am not a huge fan of the direction that Disney is taking Star Wars but that's the least of my concerns.  My real issue is the fact that the writing was poor\\, the acting atrocious\\, and the film downright boring.  I am blown away by the critics reviews on this film.  They must have been paid off","true":true}
