Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really liked it\\, and almost every negative comment that I have heard about this film would apply to other Star Wars films\\, so if you like the other ones (even just 4-7 and Rogue 1)\\, then you should like this one. This bashing of this movie seems trendy almost\\, and I remember that they did this for Empire as well\\, and now it is regarded as the best one.","true":true}
