Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful movie.....terrible....so sad...I waited in line for the opening day in Imax. The set pieces were cool but what a train wreck. No real direction....piles and piles of plot holes....like why didn't the rebels light speed one of the other ships running out of fuel through smokes battleship....it was a dumpster fire. Rain Johnson screwed the pooch on this one","true":true}
