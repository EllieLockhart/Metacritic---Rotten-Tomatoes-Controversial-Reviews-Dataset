Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoilers*\\nI truly want to believe i gave this movie a chance and as much as i want myself to like it\\, i cant lie to myself. This movie isnt even worth the time it takes to write a review\\, so ill just say a few things.\\n\\n1) Space Leia...seriously? (Someome made a comment about them throwing darts at a board for ideas\\, that was definately one of them)\\n\\n2) Luke Skywalker would never try to murder a padawan in his sleep. Ever. \\n\\n3) The end of the movie basically makes the last 30 years useless and just puts the whole story BBY(Before the Battle of Yavin) with younger characters aka actors. \\n\\nAs a side note to the community\\, we are not full of crap. I was one of the people that didn't understand all of the hate for the force awakens\\, and was willing to believe people just love to hate. But this movie is genuinely a let down from a critical\\, and abstract view of the series in its entirety. \\n\\nI believe everyone should see this movie. \\\"Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.\\\"","true":true}
