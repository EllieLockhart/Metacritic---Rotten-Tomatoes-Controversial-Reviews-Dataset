Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great ride\\, The Last Jedi is. Rian Johnson brings back\\, in spectacular fashion\\, what made Star Wars the most popular franchise in the planet: mythology. By leaning heavily on the origins of good and evil\\, and thoroughly  deconstructing its nuances\\, the writer-director lights the spark that had been ignited two years ago by JJ Abrams with The Force Awakens. This installment's true strength is in the conveyance of faith\\, the universal ideal that the fight is\\, as it will always be\\, within. Using intelligently written archetypes and anchored by compelling performances\\, this soul-searching journey soars at every possible level. The Last Jedi is exciting\\, full of heart and constantly unexpected. In fact\\, it's everything the fans have been waiting for for decades\\, and then some. Johnson might just have made the most successful piece of (official) fan fiction ever.","true":true}
