Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"El peor guion de toda la saga. Se trata de marear la perdiz para escaquearse de contar algo sobre los personajes. Es muy facil prolongar algo para no tener que llegar a nada despues de vender humo a los fans. Menuda estafa.","true":false}
