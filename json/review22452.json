{"101487":149579,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"left the theatre feeling uneasy with what I just saw\\, and a little dazed.  What have they done to this amazing story?!  I felt like something that had been a part of me for most of my life had been stolen.  This was heartbreaking.  Sounds overly dramatic\\, I know\\, but for those of you who grew up with this intriguing saga and identified with and cared about the characters - you understand.\\n\\nI went in the theatre very hopeful and excited\\, after reading the early reviews about how great it was and all the hype surrounding the return of Luke Skywalker\\, etc.\\, etc..  It didn't take long for the first hint that something was off.  Poe taunting General Hux with a 'prank call' I thought was inappropriate and didn't really set the right tone for what I was hoping for.  And\\, yes\\, I have to agree with some who say it's like a scene they would see in Spaceballs.  To kick off a movie like Star Wars with a gag killed any tension or excitement that should have been building.  But\\, this was minor and I was willing to shrug\\, overlook this\\, and move on.  Then Finn wakes up and stumbles around the ship leaking fluids.  Again\\, playing for cheap laughs.  And again\\, I can overlook this.  \\n\\nThen we cut to Luke and Rey.  A scene that we've been anticipating and speculating about for two years!  Rey returning Luke's lightsaber that has been passed down for generations.  All this drama and build up from The Force Awakens - what will Luke do?  He tosses it over his shoulder and walks away.  It was then\\, that I knew I didn't like this movie.  This was an insult - not only to the viewers\\, but to the whole story.  All the previous episodes were casually tossed away along with that lightsaber - for another attempt at a cheap laugh.\\n\\nLuke is portrayed as a crotchety old geezer who wants none of it.  This isn't the Luke Skywalker that we knew or were anticipating.  I get that his character is supposed to be in hiding\\, meditating and moping on his perceived failure in training Kylo (Ben)\\, but at some point I hoped and expected that he would come around and be the humble hero that we know\\, identify with and hope to be.  Then the odd scene with milking the bad CGI space cow and fishing with a giant pole brought this whole thing down further.  What is this??  As another insult to injury\\, all the build up and expectation to see Luke training Rey in any real way was scrapped.  Nothing really happens with that!  Rey leaves to take on Kylo on her own\\, basically discarding the whole story of The Force Awakens as meaningless - to find Luke and bring him back to help in the fight.  Rey apparently doesn't even need training.  Again\\, throwing out all importance and magic of the original trilogy.  Think of Luke's training with Yoda in Empire.  After all this\\, I'm starting to not like the character of Luke Skywalker anymore - which is a huge let down.\\n\\nRey's Jedi abilities have always been questionable.  How did she know to even think about using the Jedi Mind Trick on the guard in The Force Awakens?  How did she become so good at using a lightsaber with absolute zero training?  I get that she was pretty good with fighting with a staff\\, but taking on a trained and experienced Kylo Ren and beating him was completely unrealistic.  I thought her abilities would be explained in Last Jedi but that was ignored.  Maybe in the next one?\\n\\nSo\\, at this point\\, I'm not liking The Last Jedi\\, but maybe it gets better? When seeing the explosion on the bridge and everyone's dead and sucked out into space\\, including Leia\\, I thought; \\\"They do kill her off!\\\".  It seemed an appropriate ending for her actually\\, peacefully and beautifully floating in space during a heroic battle with the First Order.  Then I saw her twitch.  And I thought; \\\"Please don't do this\\\".  They did.  She somehow taps into her inner force\\, defying the frozen vacuum of space\\, and force floats her way back to the ship.  I almost walked out in disgust.  That's when this went from simply a movie I didn't like to a complete farce.  But\\, out of morbid curiosity\\, I stayed in my seat for the remainder.  Now I understand this a space fantasy adventure and we have to ignore and overlook things that simply cannot scientifically occur - but force or no force\\, we all know you will die instantly unprotected in space.  \\n\\nTypically\\, I can shrug off things that aren't plausible in these types of movies - to a relative level anyway.  In The Force Awakens\\, I reluctantly overlooked the complete nonsense of sucking the power of the sun to charge up the Star Killer Base.  That nearly killed the Force Awakens for me.  But\\, Space Leia succeeded in killing Last Jedi.  Now I'm just mad and I simply don't care for most of the characters anymore.  The thing I liked about Rogue One was that it was more gritty and real (as real as a space adventure can get anyway).  I was hoping that Last Jedi would pick up on this style.\\n\\nI did enjoy the fight scene in Snoke's lair - although it would have been nice to know who the hell he was!  I did see it coming when Kylo helped Rey just to get him in the Supreme Leader seat\\, but that was fine.  There are good scenes here and there - but overall it was just nonsense.  Weak story\\, weak plot\\, sub-plots going nowhere and meaningless\\, underused (as well as overused)\\, wasted\\, and pointless characters.  Porgs?!  The Casino planet was a bad and unnecessary distraction and riding bareback on space goats crashing through buildings was cringe-worthy and a throwback to the ridiculousness of the prequels.  Big letdown with Luke Skywalker and what they did with this iconic character.  BB8 hopping into a Walker and blasting away at the bad guys was beyond dumb - but at this point\\, I didn't care anymore.  Star Wars was dead.\\n\\nI'm not understanding how this can get such high ratings.  Anyone with a basic knowledge of this saga - or good screenwriting - should be appalled!  Star Wars no longer anything special.  No depth or meaning.  Just CGI nonsense meant to overtly advertise toys.","true":true}
