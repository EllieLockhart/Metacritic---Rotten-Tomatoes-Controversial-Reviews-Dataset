Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hugely disaapointing. I agree with most of the fans criticisms. I liked that they wanted to take it in a new direction- but It raised themes then dropped them without following them through. Kylo Ren is an interesting conflicted character - but without a baddie who you don't know how you can defeat there is jeopardy\\, no stakes. Any moments approaching something meaningful there was a joke that took you out of it\\, Rey is a Mary Sue. Cannot understand why the critics liked it! I think in time this will be seen an a huge misjudgement on the part of Disney- they'll lose their fanbase- as a lifelong fan I don't want anything more to do with it.","true":true}
