Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I wish this trilogy took place during the EU\\, I was pleasantly surprised by TLJ.  Some of the CGI was a bit lacking but the random Easter Eggs tossed in for EU fans were fabulous.  Loved the inclusive cast\\, something I thought was gone when the EU was disbanded.  While Rey\\, Rose\\, and Hadlo aren't Jaina\\, Mara\\, or Lumiya they are well rounded characters that are much more than the standard SF Mary Sue.  Looking forward to many more viewing to see what other treats I might have missed.","true":true}
