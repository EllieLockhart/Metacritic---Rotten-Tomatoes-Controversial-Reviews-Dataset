Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was VERY excited to see The Last Jedi\\, largely because The Force Awakens left a gaping whole where Luke Skywalker's story should have been.  Sadly\\, The Last Jedi was entertaining but a HUGE disappointment. The list of things WRONG with it is endless\\, not the least of which was how they handled -- more accurately\\, MISHANDLED -- Skywalker's story.  They've really ruined the franchise for me.","true":true}
