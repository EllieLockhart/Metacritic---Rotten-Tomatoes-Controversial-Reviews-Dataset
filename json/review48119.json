Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the original series by George Lucas was about familial conflict and the jarring internal conflict of the light and dark within us all... \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" degrades this to that of petty children with tantrums and parental issues. It does have a saving grace however\\, in that the story line is so fraught with plot holes\\, a lack of character development and a blitzkrieg-like-mess that is the storyline\\, that the audience does not have time to compute what atrocities have taken place. I felt no sympathy or empathy for the Rebel Scum nor for the any of the 2-bit characters (Carrie Fisher being the exception to this). Too many liberties were taken by the writers in their desperate attempt to forge something that resembles a coherent storyline and as a result I am beginning to understand the plight of indigenous people during the arrival of the colonials. For the price of a movie ticket I left the theatres feeling like I had just gone to my colorectal surgeon for the Disney approved routine check up. A tear drops from my eye as I finally bid adieu to a franchise that made my childhood.","true":true}
