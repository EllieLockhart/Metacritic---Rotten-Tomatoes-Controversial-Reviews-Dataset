Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even though the film was ovemade and had phenomenal acting\\, I was ultimately let down. This movie tried so hard to distance itself from The Force Awakens that it packed itself full of nonsensical deus ex machina moments(like the fact that the force protects people from the vacuum of space!) and it completely disobeys the law of Chekhov's Gun(including the fact that Luke's lightsaber called to Rey\\, yet we later learned in this movie that her parents had nothing to do with the skywalkers!) The movie also could have been so much better had it gone the way many fan theories suggested it may\\, including the various theories by the YouTube channel The Film Theorists. My final decision is that it is well made\\, but had the potential to do so much better.","true":true}
