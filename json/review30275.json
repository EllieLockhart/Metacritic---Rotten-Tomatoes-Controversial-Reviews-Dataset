Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Saw with a group of 4.  Two old enough to have seen the original first run in the theater A LONG TIME AGO... and the other 2 milenials.  2 male\\, 2 female.  We all enjoyed.   Sure\\, some corny scenes (but the Cantina in the first film wasnt corny) lots of action\\, could have cut a few things but overall we all loved it and we are looking forward to seeing the next one.","true":true}
