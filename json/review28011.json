Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes everywhere. Horrible slapstick. Completely untrue to the established characters. Story decisions that are just plain stupid. It seems Disney has zero established plan for this series. Just pump em out and rake in the dough. \\nThis script should have been trashed. I grew up with the original trilogy. I've loved this franchise all my life but The Last Jedi has made me not care about seeing any more of it. Such a shame.","true":true}
