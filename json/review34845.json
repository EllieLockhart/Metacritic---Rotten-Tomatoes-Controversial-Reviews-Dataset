Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The entire plot is driven by dumb coincidences with little cause and effect.  None of the characters had real arcs.  The movie ends in the same place it began - nothing actually happens the entire time.","true":true}
