Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredible film that surpassed my expectations. If you go in thinking this is going to be what internet rumors and trailers have set up\\, you will be sorely disappointed. Johnson made a bold move that added much needed depth and emotion to the saga. Those hating it are likely missing the point. I have seen every film since ESB in theaters\\, and I can definitely say this immediately became my favorite.","true":true}
