{"101487":147272,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this movie largely not knowing what to expect. I had seen a few of the trailers but stayed away from a lot of the hype and discussions online as I wanted a completely spoiler free experience. I was not a huge fan of Episode 7\\, and like a lot of people I felt that from a story standpoint it was a carbon copy of Episode 4\\, with few surprises and a very safe plot. I was doubly disappointed with all the hype the trailers for Episode 7 placed on the appearance of Luke Skywalker\\, a hallmark character and one of the greatest heroes of multiple generations of fans. Only to watch the entire film and only see him for nearly 10 seconds\\, not saying a word. Not to mention the completely unceremoniously death of Han Solo\\, a villain with daddy issues\\, and a heroine that for no reason at all is the best light saber wielder in the universe\\, with absolutely no force training. But I digress. Two years the wait has been. Two years of speculation\\, mystery\\, and a little bit of intrigue. This was the moment. This was the opportunity for Disney to silence all of the critics and bring our heroes the justice they needed\\, and with virtually all of the money in the world at their disposal\\, what could possibly go wrong? Well\\, as it turns out\\, virtually everything. From the moment the opening crawl graced the screen I had a bad feeling. From the poorly implemented and ill-timed jokes inspired by every Marvel movie to date\\, the nauseating purple haired forced feminism and castration of every male lead including Luke Skywalker\\, it was apparent this movie was a giant stab in the heart of all the millions and millions of fans that the series has acquired over decades of lore and fascination. Literally everything about this movie is bad. And everything that it does even remotely right ends with an awkwardly ill-timed joke that completely takes you out of the little immersion it created. I could name all the specific things that are wrong with it\\, and how it reflects on the problems with society today\\, particularly in western culture\\, but instead I'll leave a link to philosopher Stefan Molyneux's video review\\, which sums this movie up far more perfectly than I could ever put into words. I so badly wanted this movie to be great\\, and ignite that excitement within me that I felt as a kid going to the movies\\, but instead\\, it did the worst imitation of a red wedding on all of my beloved characters. R.I.P. Star Wars. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6l9go9X1EbE","true":true}
