Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The smartest\\, most deeply felt Star Wars film ever made. Challenging audience's emotions and basic thoughts and feelings. Respects the symbolism and myth of the genre. Innovative\\, fresh\\, caring and clever. Each character and plot point carefully thought out and clearly planned. Re-invigorated my love of Star Wars and made me so proud to be among the fandom.","true":true}
