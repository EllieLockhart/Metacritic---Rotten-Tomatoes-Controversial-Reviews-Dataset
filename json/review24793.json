Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"+Music\\n+Rey and Kylo Ren kicking a$$ in Snoke's red room\\n+AT - ATs\\n+good cinematography\\n\\n-Overly long\\n- At times incredibly boring\\n-SJW themes throughout\\n-Some bad acting (new character = Rose)\\n-Luke not acting like Luke\\n-Leia Pan\\n-Bad jokes\\n-Casino planet\\n-Finn is now a janitor\\n-Snoke and phasma's deaths\\n-Overall pointless story that ends where it began","true":true}
