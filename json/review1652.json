Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie it doesn't developes characters\\, the story is a mess\\, has way to much continuity problems\\, the acting is really bad (weird considering the previous one has way better acting and they are the same actors) and is boring.\\n\\nAs a fanboy it is just sad\\, it just disrespect everything the old movies or expanded universe has created I never thought I would see so many people leave and mock a star wars movie.","true":true}
