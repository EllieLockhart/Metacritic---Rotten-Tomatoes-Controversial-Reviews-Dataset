Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"even special effects could not win oscar\\,so wanted to see mark win best actor could easly have won given a chance such poor writing put a stop to that. This film was so overated it looked like a college project special effects shame because we all know that the actors all can act but loked so bad with really stupid lines of dialogue. In a few years time people will say do you rember when starwars was good. After phantom menace i felt it was a film for kid but i liked it\\, i even think ewak films were better than this film it was like starwars christmas special all over again.","true":true}
