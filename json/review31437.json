Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Someone else said this; I think this is the perfect contextualization for my thoughts too. \\n\\nI think TFA and TLJ are two sides of the same coin where they both sacrificed storytelling and worldbuilding to achieve what it set out to do.\\n\\nTFA Set out to redo A New Hope and get people jazzed about Star Wars again by redoing what made it work last time. However in order to do that it set the world back to Pre-ROTJ status by undoing alot of victories\\, having the exact same conflict with the same same vehicles each side is using\\, with the exact same mission statement projected at the end of the trilogy (the hero of the trilogy is tasked with rebuilding the Jedi)\\, making the sequels pointless\\n\\nTLJ was as you said\\, a massive over correction\\, where in order to be different and subvert expectations they set the story back further by making large chunks of TFA pointless and setting up quite a few contradictions along the way. Yeah it was surprising and unexpected but it also feels like it lacked good story structure and it forgot to justify itself along the way\\n\\nBoth films are a victim of the others ambition and both make the other weaker IMO.","true":true}
