{"101487":175334,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi is beautifully shot and the acting is great\\, the fights are cool and that's about all I can say I liked about this movie. Tlj takes a big dump on tfa and the ot. It makes Luke into a creepy uncle and cowered who just wants to die. He isn't Luke from the ot. They throw away seeds that jj abrams planted in tfa and the movie feels like it has no purpose.","true":true}
