Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To many Spaceball\u2019s moments and not enough Star Wars moments! Plus they made Luke a scared wuss who gets knocked on his ass by Rey in a stick fight. Yoda seemed strange and out of character and the CGI was often just bad!","true":true}
