Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has some of the best\\n space action sequences the SW universe has to offer however Rian Johnson has single handedly destroyed everything Luke Skywalker stood for. Luke's legacy and lucas' vision are both a joke now. We are basically left with a poorly written\\, non-compelling but for no good reason an overpowered female lead who I am sure  \\\"will prevail against all odds\\\". Wow this isn't a Star Wars movie at all guys. This is just another Disney fairy tale for 12 year olds!\\nMark Hamill and Luke deserved way better than this!","true":true}
