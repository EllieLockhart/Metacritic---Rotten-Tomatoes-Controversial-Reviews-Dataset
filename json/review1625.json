Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time Star Wars fan myself\\, this was truly disappointing. Not only that\\, I genuinely don't think it's that great of a movie altogether. It has its moments. But for the most part\\, there are just too many flaws in the narrative\\, plot\\, and characters.","true":true}
