Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have never really been a Star Wars fan until The Force Awakens\\, so my review has really little to do with all the canon\/non-canon material. This movie has fantastic visual effects and music\\, but not much else. Beyond what poor writing for the characters and subplots that were irrelevant throw away scenes\\, the script for this was incredibly poorly written. My theater actually laughed at several scenes (that weren't intended to be funny). It is apparent that Rian Johnson has never taken a science class before--the many technical errors made it difficult to even watch seriously. The lack of backstory or explanation was just jarring\\, and although I only know these characters from two movies\\, I think many of the characters were just a waste of time. I really think this movie has had a chilling effect on whether I even see Episode 9 now. Beyond what other comments I've seen from the kind of hardcore fanboys that speak on things I've never heard of before\\, the story\\, plot\\, and motivations are speak to amateur writers (and a definitely lack of effort to craft a truly good story).","true":true}
