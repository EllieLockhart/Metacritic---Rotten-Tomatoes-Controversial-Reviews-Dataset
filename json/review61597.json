Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Stunning graphics can't save this game.  The story is terrible and told poorly\\, the new characters are unlikable.  Ending pointless.  They had a real opportunity to make this game something special\\, and instead made some very strange decisions with regard to the plot and characters. It seemed like it was made in the wrong order\\, would love to have developed sympathy with Abby and maybe have her work with Ellie before killing the main reason people loved the first game... To give it a zero is wrong\\, Objectively the graphics and animation is great\\, the game play is ok but highly repetitive and feels like a real slog towards the end. You have to credit the developers for the sheer effort that has gone into the game and for taking a risk with the story\\, it just didn't pay off for me. How anyone can give this a 10 and call it a masterpiece is beyond me\\, its a deeply flawed title but god bless if you liked it.  Picking up the game second hand for \u00a320 or so would be a fair shout.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
