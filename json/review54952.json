Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's was really good first watch but when I started thinking thinking about it\\, it really just presention. When u watch again it's just long and  tedious . The characters were totally botched and\/or sidelined really great characters and were totally not in line with their characters. Character development mostly sucked when u really sit down and think about. It's weird how the blame of the plot is on the only people of color? Plot was interesting first watch because it doing fakeouts and you were intionally curious but on second watch it lost its rewatchiblity and charisma. Also humanized and spent too much time on that crybaby kylo ren\\, who after all that baiting was after all just a whiny crybaby. Also he's sorta an allegorical nazi??? Sooo...yea weird to spend half a movie on  Marilyn Manson . It had so much potential and just really disappointed the fans\\, but audience memebers who aren't into Star Wars may find it fun for 1 or 2 watches. I mean why give the fans what they want. Also waaaayyyy too long honestly. Also on an unrelated note\\, where were the gays come on just want one space gay in a sci-fi movie as a giant lesbian. Not the worst but no that good. I mean\\, why give the fans what they want?","true":true}
