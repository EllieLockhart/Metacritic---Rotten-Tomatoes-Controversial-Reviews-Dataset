{"101487":105119,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a lifelong fan of the series I thought the Force Awakens was a limited\\, almost parodying rehash of the original trilogy\\, but I understand that they were  introducing the world and story to a new audience so I waited patiently for a deeper\\, more complex sequel in the vain of The Empire Strikes Back\\, which was the darker\\, brooding cousin of Star Wars (and this is why it was my favourite in the original trilogy).\\n\\nThe Last Jedi completely delivered on expanding and building the world\\, bringing out the fun textures I always loved about the original trilogy (the wacky creatures\\, weird space jazz in the casino)\\, introducing new ships\\, new worlds.  Visually I don't think they could have done better. I thought Leia's character was really flat and poorly -underused in TFA whereas in TLJ we see the complex\\, evolved person she would have become after struggling for so many years.  She is much more pivotal in this entry to the series and to see her playing off each character was extremely gratifying (ie she shoots Poe Dameron! Leia really exists on her own terms and not as a function of the story\\, like any well written character).\\n\\n As for Luke Skywalker\\, I always thought the original trilogy made his ascension to Jedi Knight appear easy\\, and I didn't especially like what he brought to the series.  I could not have been more surprised by who he has become in this film.  Seeing him throw the light saber over his shoulder\\, flatly reject his own status as a legend\\, then finally play the ultimate trick on Kylo Ren\\, was completely thrilling.  I really didn't know what he was going to do next and generally this was the feeling of the whole film.  Plans don't work\\, the line between good and evil is unclear.  Rian Johnson illustrates this consistently through the film in an age of films about heros where there is little grey area.  I appreciated this tremendously and was genuinely surprised by small twists like Kylo Ren aaaalmost turning away from the dark side and thinking that Vice Admiral Holdo was going to maybe turn out to be someone we don't like\\, only to pull a spectacular jump to light speed\\, cutting through the destroyers and sacrificing herself in doing so.\\nWith every loss Rian Johnson boils Star Wars down to a reduced state where there is but a tiny glimmer of hope\\, and a whole set of new characters (because it can't just be a story about the Skywalkers for ever and ever) asking more complex questions.  The potential moving forward is enormous and really no one can say what will happen next.  Isn't that what is exciting about filmmaking\\, or do we want to all be spoonfed\\, worn out cinematic clich\u00e9s? I'm going to see this movie again at least once while it is in theatres and I expect in retrospect this will be one of those complex\\, where dark films people say \\\"everyone hated this film when it came out but with time it has proven to be one of the best in the series.\\\"","true":true}
