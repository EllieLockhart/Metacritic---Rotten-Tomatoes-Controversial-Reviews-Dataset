Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utterly disappointed.. I wasn't impressed with TFA to begin with because of its lack of originality (a new hope v2.0) but was excited to see TLJ. Rey is portrayed as a flawless character who doesn't need anyone's help. How to empathize for a character that gets everything right at the first attempt? I can't. I was thrilled that they introduced a lead female character in the new trilogy and I'm all in for gender equality but I don't think you can convey a positive message by bashing EVERY male character. Poe is hot headed and impulsive (needs to be slapped in the face by Leia to get his sh*t together)\\, Finn became a coward in TLJ (??!!) and needs Rose to be guided on the right path again (had high hopes for Finn..)\\, Hux was portrayed as a ridicule tool\\, the code breaker was no less but a traitor with no morals\\, Kylo Ren came across as a whiny kid\\, and Luke... ah Luke.. hopeful hero a long long time ago that turned into a pathetic\\, bitter old man. He would have been an alcoholic if that wasn't a Disney movie. On the contrary\\, all female characters are noble\\, righteous\\, brave\\, talented (Leia\\, Admiral Holdo\\, Rose\\, Rey). I hope this is enough subliminal messages for you. This is not Star wars anymore.. They should have called this movie the Gender wars. Kathleen Turner and Disney are trying too hard to shove their political agenda down our throats. Thanks but I'll pass on this.. The only positive outcome of this movie is that it makes the original trilogy (even with its flaws) looks epic and timeless. Star wars ended when Lucas sold the rights to Disney (to my great disappointment).","true":true}
