Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed! This movie completely changed Luke Skywalker from a hero to a coward. He saved his father\\, someone deeply entrenched in the dark side\\, but then he actually considered killing Ben Solo\\, the son of his sister and best friend because he saw the dark side in him? When the boy was asleep and hadn\u2019t hurt anyone? Really?? Surely even considering killing someone\\, let alone your young nephew\\, is dark? The original Luke would never have done this. It feels like the director has done everything possible to make his mark and change the direction of the story that JJ (successfully) resurrected - but his portrayal has destroyed the essence of the Star Wars story and the plot line for Luke is just ridiculous - and worse than that - a horribly sad end for a really great character.
