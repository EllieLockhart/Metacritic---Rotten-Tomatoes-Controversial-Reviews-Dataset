Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An unnecessarily long and bumpy journey full of unbelievable plot holes that make the resistance and the first order look amateurish and incompetent. Only a handful of scenes measure up\\, leaving one overwhelmingly disappointed. Better luck next time.","true":true}
