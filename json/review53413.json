{"101487":116146,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*DISCLAIMER* This review has no hard spoilers\\, and will only make sense if you watch the film.\\n\\nAs an avid Star Wars fan\\, I really wanted to like this film. In fact I mentally prepared my self to have zero expectations for what it was \\\"supposed\\\" to be\\, I wanted to judge it on it's merits alone. Despite a really nice opening space battle scene (except for bombs \\\"dropping\\\" in zero gravity space)\\, as the movie progressed\\, it's weaknesses became glaring.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is almost an intentional betrayal of The Force Awakens. Every interesting plot element\\, intriguing twist\\, or unanswered question from the predecessor was either dismissed or given a very anti-climactic resolution.  It was almost as if Johnson was mocking Abrams interpretation of the Star Wars universe\\, and paid almost no homage to Episode VII.\\n\\nThe film gave no great payoff\\, it just ended as simple light side vs. dark side paradigm\\, which was odd\\, as throughout the film there were allusions to challenging this assumption.  The film also had frustrating plot holes\\, dating all the way back to the original trilogy\\, the continuity is nothing short of bazaar. Not to mention a story line involving Fin was almost entirely unnecessary.\\n\\nThe new characters introduced were nothing short of annoying\\, unlikeable\\, and unneeded. I am convinced that Rose Tico is even more unbearable than Jar Jar Binks\\, because at least with Jar Jar\\, you're not supposed to take him seriously. \\nThe scene where Rose and Fin kiss\\, is probably one of the most awkward kissing scenes to ever grace the big screen.  \\nVice Admiral Haldo could not have been a more cookie cutter character\\, with nothing but cliche's and platitudes coming out of her mouth. I was confused as to why she was in the movie at all. \\nCaptain Phasma and Supreme Leader Snoke had potential to be really interesting\\, but the writers were clearly dismissive of these characters and hardly gave them the time of day.\\n\\nOf the greatest crimes committed in the writing though\\, was not the sins of commission\\, but the sins of omission. C3PO\\, R2\\, Admiral Ackbar\\, and Yoda were mere props as opposed to characters with rich backstories and histories. These characters could have carried the film much better then the new ones\\, or they could have left them out entirely\\, either would have been preferable.\\n\\nOverall\\, the last Jedi was frustrating\\, incoherent\\, and crowded. It would better fit into an obligatory Sci-Fi film as opposed to a culture-shaping\\, space-fantasy Epic. It will probably go down as my least favourite film in the franchise\\, competing with Episode II for that spot.","true":true}
