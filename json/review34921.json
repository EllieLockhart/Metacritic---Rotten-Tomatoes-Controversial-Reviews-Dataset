Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is filled to the brim with Deus Ex Machina. The heroes are thick with plot armor while the villains have none. The end result is a film with zero tension and cardboard characters. To be fair\\, the movie has good pacing and is visually stunning\\, but everything else is lacking.","true":true}
