Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would like to sue Disney for false advertising. This was sold as a SEQUEL to Force Awakens but it disregarded even single question that film raised. Who was Snoke? Who were the Knights of Ren? Where did the First Order come from? How\/when\/where did Snoke meet Kylo and seduce him to the darkside? How did dumb orange Katana get Luke's lightsaber\\, etc.\\n\\nThose orphan sIaves at the end? That felt like a complete out of the blue conclusion to some other film. It did nothing to set up the next film.\\n\\nHow can this be called a TRILOGY if one film doesn't follow the next but are only loosely connected? So dumb.\\n\\nWhen I see other reviews here and look at the scores they're giving\\, I don't understand how RotTom can collate it to 49%.  Thats far too high.","true":true}
