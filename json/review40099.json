Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not a Star Wars film. \\n\\nI think the key thing was\\, when I left The force awakens midnight showing I was so excited I went home\\, slept and went to the first showing of it that morning!\\nI saw rouge one and went home and watched a new hope because I NEEDED more! \\n\\nI left this film and decided not to see it the again the same day\\, I wasn't in the least bit excited and im actually worried now that the end of the trilogy (which is ending the Skywalker story after 9 films) is going to be a dud. I mean after all these years since a New Hope first came out\\, it is so vitally important to get these right!\\n\\nI honestly get the impression that Disney is just focusing on getting new generations on board. They are introducing too many characters with weak stories and no background just to sell more toys. \\n\\nI hate to say this but I think ill be done with star wars after this trilogy and the stand alone films. I think after that point Disney will be too engrained in the DNA of them and it won't be the same. Which is absolutely heartbreaking.","true":true}
