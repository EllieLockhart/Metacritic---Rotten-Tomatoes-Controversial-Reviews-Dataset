Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The logic of the story is incredibly dumb and nonsensical. First\\, the \\\"smaller\\\" rebel ships are fast enough to stay out of range but not fast enough to escape? OK. Then the plan is to escape the ship in smaller vessels because Leah knows\\, \\\"the Empire isn't scanning for smaller ships.\\\" Why would they not be scanning for smaller ships? It takes a civilian criminal to convince them to run a \\\"decloak scan\\\" later in the movie to fix that bit of incompetency. Then when Finn and Rose leave the ship to go to Vegas\\, they're ship is assumed to be \\\"space debris\\\" and allowed to just pass by the empire. These kind of annoying plot problems are what ruin this movie for me.","true":true}
