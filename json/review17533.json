Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up for this site simply so I could give this movie 1\/2 star.  It was an absolute dumpster fire.  Not a bot.  Not a troll.  Didn't love JJ Abrams' take on \\\"The Force Awakens\\\"\\, but it was masterful compared to this exceptionally bad film.","true":true}
