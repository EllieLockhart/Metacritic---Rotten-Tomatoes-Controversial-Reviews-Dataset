Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes galore\\, dumb major character decisions\\, poorly balanced humour and underwhelming new characters majorly take away from some of the best scenes in the franchise. As a lifelong Star Wars fan I was extremely dissapointed by this movie\\, especially after the triumph that was Rogue One. I also feel as a continuation of The Force Awakens (which I liked) it follows on poorly\\, and actually makes TFA worse. I came out of the theatre sad.","true":true}
