Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was the most disappointing Star Wars film to date. This review is not about the cinematography\\, lack of character development\\, nor unnecessary plot points. Rather\\, the movie makes a concerted effort to raze to the ground everything that made Star Wars great\\, and that I loved. \\n\\nThere is no longer room for a swashbuckling hero\\, were shown Po's antics just lead to death. The goodness and nobility of the Jedi Order where we knew that \\\"for over a 1000 generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians peace and justice in the Old Republic\\\" is replaced with the understanding the Jedi were in fact arrogant failures. Even the noble lightsabers  \\\"an elegant weapon\\, for a more civilized age\\\" is simply a weak \\\"laser sword\\\" incapable of making a difference. I could continue\\, but the point is made.\\n\\nIf the viewer is a casual Star Wars fan\\, than there is a good chance they'll enjoy the film and the new direction (or lack thereof) it's going in. If on the other hand you're like me\\, and hold an admiration for the ideals of the Jedi and the archetypes that made Star Wars a fun adventure filled with heartbreak and noble triumph\\, then you'll find yourself disappointed and maybe even a little heartbroken.","true":true}
