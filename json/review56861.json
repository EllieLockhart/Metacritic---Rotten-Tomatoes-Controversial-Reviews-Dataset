Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is nothing in this movie that makes sense. Reviewers from YouTube come up with better story and plot than this multi million dollar waste of time. Effects are not everything and negative feedback does not mean trolling. Ryan Johnson should be ashamed\\, Mark Hamill too for agreeing to act like he did. This is not only a weak star wars movie\\, is a weak movie in general. Fan fiction makes more sense. 1.5 star for effects only.","true":true}
