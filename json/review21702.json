Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just an overall terrible movie.  Glaring plot holes that repeatedly break the aesthetic distance.  Poor use of existing characters that only served to detract from the development of characters new to the franchise.  If this story had not taken place in the starwars universe it would have been a flop.","true":true}
