Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible nonsensical writing. Lotta plot points didn't make sense and didn't align with the universe. Poorly developed characters. Pretty sad that this is canon. The only good thing I could say about the movie is the effects but should be expected from a movie with this budget.","true":true}
