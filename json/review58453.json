Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"All\\\" men characters behave like idiots\\, all women strong and brave\\nWe don't sacrifice ourselves for the greater good anymore\\, unless you're a strong woman\\nRules of space don't apply to this movie\\, gravity and inertia.(Burning fuel at max speed)\\nEstablished rules of the SW saga don't apply to this movie.
