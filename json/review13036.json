{"101487":130882,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-28","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't hate all the things that I understand other viewers detested about this film. I don't particularly care about the weird milk sloth monsters\\, although I find it to be a strange choice by the director to include it. Further\\, I don't mind the angry emo teenager character that Adam Driver portrayed. In fact\\, I rather think he's one of the best things about these new movies. My concerns generally have to do with poor storytelling. I was struck throughout the film that the plot was not the natural outcome of the characters desires and subsequent motivated actions. Rather\\, it seemed that the different plot points were chosen\\, and then the characters were forced to do ridiculous things to get to those points.\\n\\nThe most egregious example of this was the decision by Laura Dern's character Vice Admiral Holdo to refrain from explaining to most of the people under her command what her plan was. I understand some viewers are saying that she had to keep quiet about it in order to ensure that the First Order would not become apprised of the plan\\, fearing that there might have been a spy on board the ship. But given that the First Order was obviously trying to murder everyone aboard the ship\\, it would have had to have been a very loyal spy indeed who was willing to die with the Resistance on the off chance that he or she might be able to come up with one last bit of useful intelligence. Even if this were a legitimate concern\\, certainly she could have told Po about her plan\\, considering that he had just personally destroyed the First Order's massive super weapon in the previous movie\\, and their Dreadnought in this one. There was no way he was a spy. There were other minor infractions\\, like the need for rebel commanders to die while still piloting their ships\\, as if auto pilot\\, a droid\\, or a brick and some rope couldn't keep the vessels flying in a straight line for the last few seconds before they were destroyed by the first order. I believe these rebel commanders had to sacrifice themselves just to set up the idea that Holdo had to stay on board the cruiser in order that she might be there to use it to ram the pursuing fleet.\\n\\nSome of the other plot choices that were made in this movie had more to do with ignoring established rules of physics in the Star Wars universe\\, or creating new rules that didn't make sense. An example of the latter was Holdo's using the Resistance's abandoned cruiser to ram the First Order fleet. There is nothing wrong with saying that a ship can be used as a hyperspeed ram to destroy another ship. It's a science fiction universe: you can say the physics are whatever you want. However\\, this was a new rule that didn't make any sense in the context of all the other movies. If you could just ram a ship to destroy it\\, how is it that the rebels didn't just send empty cruisers on suicide missions to destroy fleets of Imperial destroyers during the battle of Hoth? Why wasn't there a large ship full of rocks launched at the Death Star? If this was a thing (and apparently\\, from the reaction of the First Order's commanders when they say Holdo bringing her ship about to ram them\\, not only was it a thing but EVERYONE KNEW IT WAS A THING)\\, then certainly everyone would have been using it as the best and most successful weapon in space combat ever invented. So the new rule didn't make any sense because for it to make sense\\, it would either have to have been a brand new discovery (which would have stunk a bit of deus ex machina)\\, or something that had been used in previous films.\\n\\nI don't particularly want to write a total review of all the plot holes and examples of shoddy\\, lazy writing in this film. If you're interested\\, you can tune into an extensive video analysis of the film by a YouTuber called MauLer\\, and it is entitled \\\"A Critique of Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\\\" I found his critique to be spot on in every detail\\, in some cases mirroring my own notions\\, and in others calling to mind writing mistakes that hadn't yet occurred to me. Warning: if you think this review is long\\, then his is epic.\\n\\nThere is one last fault about the film that may not be so much a question of poor plotting that I would like to address. It is a question of theme. \\n\\nI believe the reason so many of us have come to love Star Wars and its universe so much is because the first three films gave us something far more substantial that light saber duels\\, space dogfights\\, and pointy-eared green muppets. I believe the first films were so successful because they preached (or perhaps confirmed for us) a message of faith.\\n\\nYou may remember that in the closing moments of the first film's Death Star battle\\, Obi Wan whispered to Luke from beyond the grave\\, \\\"use the force\\, Luke.\\\" Luke was the main character of the film. The theme of the film was wrapped up in his story arc. He was pulled from a life of obscurity and told that there was something special about him--that he had a gift. He was further taught that if he would but trust his feelings\\, with his gift he could accomplish anything.\\n\\nWhen Obi Wan tells Luke to use the force\\, he is effectively telling him that he must believe. Luke does\\, and uses the force\\, and with it is able to destroy the Death Star and save everyone.\\n\\nIn the second movie\\, the theme is the same. When Luke cannot move the X-wing\\, but Yoda can\\, Luke says he can't believe it. Yoda replies\\, \\\"that is why you fail.\\\" Because Luke fails to have faith in the calm\\, light side of the force\\, but instead goes off to rescue his companions in Cloud City\\, he again fails (to some degree...some of them do get saved\\, after all) as manifested in the loss of his hand.\\n\\nIn Return of the Jedi\\, Luke manages to believe again\\, to the point that he throws aside his light saber in the presence of the Emperor\\, come what may. For his faithfulness\\, he is rewarded with the turning of his father back to the light\\, and the victory of the rebels over the empire.\\n\\nSo not only did the original trilogy ask us to suspend our disbelief in order that we might enjoy the fictional story they recounted\\, but they went further and said that we could suspend our disbelief in real life. They carried home the theme that YOU are special\\, YOU have a gift\\, and if you will but believe\\, you can accomplish anything. I think that theme resonated powerfully with a great number of us\\, and we associated that feeling with lightsabers\\, space dogfights\\, and pointy-eared muppets.\\n\\nThe new films not only seem muddy in their themes\\, but actually ERASE the theme of the original series. Luke Skywalker is no longer special. He has turned from his gift. He believed\\, and it worked for a time\\, but then everything fell apart and he lost everything. All the victories that came from his gift and belief in the original trilogy were erased by the new films (and of course\\, so of this was done in episode 7\\, so this film is not completely to blame). \\n\\nMany people\\, after watching and thinking about the three prequels\\, started to say that George Lucas had ruined their childhood. Perhaps he had\\, to some degree\\, by replacing the theme of special gifts and belief with midichlorians. But with this film\\, Rian Johnson has done far worse. He has utterly assassinated the character of Luke Skywalker. He has shown that having a gift and believing in it will only win you heartache and pain\\, and all your efforts will turn the people you most care for into failures\\, or worse yet\\, evil\\, mass-murdering monsters. What an awful direction to go in with such a beloved storyline. One wonders if Rian Johnson or Kathleen Kennedy or whoever else it was that chose this direction even liked the original movies.","true":true}
