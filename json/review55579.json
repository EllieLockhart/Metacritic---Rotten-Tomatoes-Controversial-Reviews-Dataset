Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as bad as Phantom Menace\\, at least Phantom Menace had a great lightsaber fight at the end\\, but not a great movie. The Finn\/Rose arc is just filler\\, extending the movie needlessly.  Chewie has been relegated to background for comic relief.  The Force now has grown to have even more power than ever before.  The First Order is led by a bunch of idiots\\, and nowhere near an imposing threatening force. Poe is an idiot without any sense of ever being in a real military.  Leia has some type of mystical force powers never before seen\\, for someone who never formally trained as a Jedi. Rey is somewhat interesting\\, but the story took an arc that was boring\\, she should have joined up with Kylo to give us a cliffhanger.  The most interesting character is Benicio Del Toro's DJ\\, as that was the BEST character in the whole movie\\, but still stupid. And Luke reverted back to being a whiny bitch boy like he was in the original Star Wars\\, not continuing to mature like he did in Empire and Return\\, but is now a \\\"Get off my lawn\\\" hermit.  Questions about Snoke and the First Order were never revealed from the 1st movie.  Overall\\, some good visuals\\, horrible story with plot holes you could fly a star destroyer through\\, and few good chuckles from Chewbacca and some one liners.  Not the worst Star Wars movie\\, but no where near the best.  Young children may like it.","true":true}
