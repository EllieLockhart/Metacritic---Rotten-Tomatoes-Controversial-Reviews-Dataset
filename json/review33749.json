Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. Random sub plots that are pointless with terrible humor. It looked cool but you can usher in a new age without destroying past characters. The treatment of Luke and perversion of his character made me never want to see another one of these movies again. Finn is a cool character that they use as a comic relief and really turn into a slightly better jar jar. In general this made me never want to see another Disney made star wars film ever again and really destroyed the awesome memories I had of this series. Bootleg guardians of the galaxy that isn't good.","true":true}
