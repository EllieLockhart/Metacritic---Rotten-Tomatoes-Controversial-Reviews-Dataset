Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The critics- rotten tomato score is way off on this one. This movie fails to deliver on so many levels. The plot was a cheap knock off from the original Return of the Jedi movie that painfully tried to capture the same viewer awe. Unfortunately Return of the Jedi was the great comeback from the dark dismal Empire Strikes Back...this was the politically correct millennial version that makes sure everything is gender-ethnic neutral\\, being wealthy=you selling guns to feed a war of destruction while no creatures will be harmed or consumed (unless youre a Wookie...he's excused because he is a misunderstood alien minority). We just need Buzzfeed to do 12 ways Star Wars is socially sensible for todays young viewers. (Eye-roll)\\nThe plot was also under-developed and poorly written. Save your $$. Because this bombed\\, I will not see it again (like I would with all other great movies) and not sure I'm going to finish watching the sequel. Congratulations Disney...you have officially murdered Star Wars.","true":true}
