Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible story. I liked\\, The Force Awakens\\, but Johnson destroyed the lead up\\, came up with a story that sucked. 4-6 built up characters. This one there is no back story\\, and when given a chance to create one for Rey\\, Johnson just skips it. The movie sucked and I am not going to buy either the digital or the DVD. Which says something as I've purchased all the rest\\, some 2-3 times. With different kinds of platforms over the years.","true":true}
