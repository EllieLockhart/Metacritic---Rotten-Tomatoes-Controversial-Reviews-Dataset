Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incredible addition to the stories\\, with plenty of twists that keep the series fresh! A lot of other movies suffer relying far too much on nostalgic elements and a very predictable formula that fans have become far too comfortable with. This movie is great because it takes so many risks\\, and calls into question the values that Star Wars has established in the past\\, with characters consistently failing to follow (Such as the entire Jedi Order) to those who say this is out of Luke's character\\, you have to remember this movie takes place 40 YEARS after the events of Return of the Jedi. You let me know if you're the same exact person in 40 years!","true":true}
