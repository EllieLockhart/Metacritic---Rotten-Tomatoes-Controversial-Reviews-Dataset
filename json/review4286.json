Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By reducing to ashes all that SW had been building for the last 40 years\\, Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy proved to be disloyal and untrustworthy egomaniacs. TLJ is definitively NOT a SW movie. It's just a bad and silly joke\\, and the plot has no logic whatsoever. Both the characters and the story have become meaningless\\, and the movie goes to nowhere.","true":true}
