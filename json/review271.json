The \\\"butterfly effect\\\" system is out of this world\\, and the story had some interesting twists too.\rI am definitely going to be doing at least a second playthrough of this game. It runs smoothly and it's just an overall incredible game. If you like anything at all by TellTale games\\, you'll LOVE Until Dawn!!","true":true}
