Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"All the \\\"bold\\\" decisions made in this movie -- including from the character assissination of Luke Sywalker and the actual unceremonious assassination of Snoke -- might have worked just fine if the movie wasn't just objectively bad. \\n\\nIt incorporated some of the worst aspects of the prequels\\, featured one-dimensional\\, mostly uninspiring and uninsteresting characters from both sides\\, a completely nonsensical and pointless story\\, and had me sitting in the theater actively disliking or cringing during just about every scene.\\n\\nOh well\\, I told myself I would stop caring after TFA\\, but now I truly don't\\, so that's freeing to some degree at least. It's over\\, and that's really a shame. Just another reminder that everything you once loved will either die or become a perverse version of itself\\, and then you will die.","true":true}
