Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why I liked it:\\n1-Visually this movie is absolutely stunning. A well-balanced use of  CG and animatronics.\\n2-It has some resemblance with \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\" but still manages to tell an original story.\\n3-The movie was not too serious or too light hearted. I think the hit the right spot in terms of the tone of the movie. \\n4-They didn't shy away to kill off some important character. (which is also a problem with this movie.) \\n\\nWhy I did not :\\n1-It contained three movies within it.\\n2-First I thought these three different plots will lead to a point where all them will serve a purpose to help each other. But instead\\, it was just three different characters personal journey which leads to nowhere.\\n4-Few characters were wasted and few characters were given just too much importance.","true":true}
