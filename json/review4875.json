Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Considering this was meant to be an installment in the Star Wars saga absolutely nothing about this film felt connected to it''s predesessor's.  The compelling character relationships established in The Force Awakens were nowhere to be seen here with an array of really badly written new faces joining the the ensble cast instead and the general structure of the film was just all over the place.  There is luckily a series of books now considered Star Wars legends by Disney that tell the continued Skywalker saga competently and as George Lucas had envisioned\\, I'd highly recommend anyone with even a passing liking of star wars to buy these on paper or in audio book form over being disappointed by whatever the Disney machine is churning out to push it's political agendas and merchandise over the next few years\\, it's a tar real shame to see beloved franchises spoiled by greedy corporations desperate to monetise nostalgia.","true":true}
