{"101487":149326,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi can be described by a single word: bold. It has plenty of problems. It keeps complex logical webs at check at one moment\\, but throws logic out of the airlock five minutes later. It is incoherently put together at some points and honestly\\, some of the CG FX was not optimal (not due their quality\\, but due to the direction I feel). It is not a perfect film at all. But what is good about it is awe inspiring\\, refreshing breath of crisp fresh air into the cinema culture of prefabricated franchises for lazy audiences.\\nFirst of all\\, it is visually surprising\\, playful and creative. Gone are boring sequences of medium shots of textbook shot-reverse shot dialogues in between fastfood-like action scenes. Where TFA didn't let you realise it was visually not that stunning by overwhelming you with hectic action\\, Last Jedi doesn't let you realise it's actually quite slow-paced thanks to it's interesting camera work.\\nSecond of all\\, we get actual character development. While in TFA only character with any development was actually Finn\\, while others were exactly the same people at the end as they were at the beginning\\, just located somewhere else\\, in Last Jedi people evolve. They question who they are\\, they realise new things and they adapt. Poe is the cocky pilot we all like\\, but throughout the film\\, he is forced to admit it's not just his life he gambles with. Rey\\, Luke\\, Kylo\\, they all gain perspective trough interaction with others and have to face their demons. The only problem with this is\\, that any development of the world had to make space for the character development. In a way\\, it is like a theatre play\\, the stage is set in the beginning of the film and everything plays out on it\\, without the stage evolving in any way. But if TFA introduced some chess peaces\\, Last Jedi moves those chess peaces into position for grand finale. \\nLast Jedi also mends some prequel mistakes by returning to more mystical explanation of the Force.\\nLast but not least\\, this film is daring. People tend to understand Star Wars like some finished art piece that should be forever locked down in a glass box and never touched. Thankfully\\, Ryan Johnson came in and smashed that glass box to pieces. Many people adore Star Wars\\, I know I do\\, but I want to see living\\, breathing universe\\, not and old\\, stale mummified corpse. Sure enough when you ditch prescribed recipes for success (that are so prevalent in eg MCU) and venture into the unknown of creative expression of any kind\\, you are bound to make some mistakes. But you are also about to find lot of amazing stuff and Last Jedi is proof of that. It has it's kinks\\, quirks and seriously WTF moments\\, but it's fresh\\, bold and nutritious piece of cinema and I don't know about you\\, but I will take new and interesting Star Wars over safe and boring Star Wars any time.\\nMy review might change after I've seen the film for the second time\\, which I most certainly will.","true":true}
