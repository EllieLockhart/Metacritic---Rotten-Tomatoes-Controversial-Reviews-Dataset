Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most enjoyable thing about it was that it gave the finger to all your stupid fan theories about who is Snoke and how Ray is Luke's\/Obi's\/Han's\/Palpatine's\/Snoke's daughter. So glad it shattered all of your cliche wishes. Go watch Game of Thrones if you want fan service.","true":true}
