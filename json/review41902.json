Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is very controversial. I think the audience didn't like this movie as much as all the previous 'Star Wars' movies because of the high expectations and major disagreements with the portrayals of several characters. It seems that Rian Johnson has a very non-traditional vision about how Star Wars 8 needs to look like. Some plot decisions can bring lots of disappointment and that's pretty normal. In a few parts it can get really boring. But on the other hand\\, some action sequences are so beautifully shot! Developing such characters as Rey and Kyle Ren is definitely a good choice\\, but some arcs are too useless. That's it. Everything depends on you\\, fellow Star Wars fans. May the Force be with you!","true":true}
