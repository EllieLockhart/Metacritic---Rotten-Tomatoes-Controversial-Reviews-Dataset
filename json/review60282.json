And to then see him die the way he did just broke my heart and then they expected me to like the character who killed him? hell no like i really don't care about Abby or her dad and i fully understand why Joel did what he did to save his 2nd daughter figure since he had already lost his actual daughter. If you are gonna kill a main character do it the right way and a few examples of games who did that are Red Dead Redemption 2(Arthur) and Telltale The Walking Dead(Lee). I also feel like if we are gonna kill hundreds of people and then just let Joel's actual killer go it's just stupid\u2026 Expand","true":true}
