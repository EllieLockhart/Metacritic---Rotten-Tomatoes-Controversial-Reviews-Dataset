Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie. I won't watch any new movie from this franchise. I was 8 when Star Wars A New Hope hit theaters\\, and this movie - The Last Jedi\\, same as previous The Force Awakens ruined it all for me. I regret watching them both.","true":true}
