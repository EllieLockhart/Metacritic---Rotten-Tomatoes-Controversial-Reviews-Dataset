{"101487":130292,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I created an account here just for the purpose of bashing this movie.\\n\\nI grew up watching the original Star Wars\\, and even suffered through the Lucas reboots\\, despite the fact that they were relatively awful.  I've always loved the movies\\, and I hoped Disney would reboot the franchise successfully.\\n\\nWow was I disappointed with this movie.\\n\\nThis film is an unmitigated mess.  The direction is subpar\\, the flow of the narrative suffers from simplistic and short-sighted writing\\, and the humor is more off than on.\\n\\nLuke's character has lost all the spark and fight that made his character so attractive; now he's a lonely old guy who spends 95% of his screen time stomping away from Rey like a spoiled child.  No sense of doing the right thing\\, no sense of an obligation to those fighting against the Dark Side.  The reason for this?  Well\\, he started a Jedi training temple\\, and his nephew had some dark thoughts.  So he tried to kill him\\, and things went haywire.  Now he's pouting on a distant island.\\n\\nThis is the same Luke that could not bring himself to kill his father\\, because he saw the good in him.  The same Luke who fought against all odds simply because it was the right thing to do...and now we find out he tried to murder his nephew.  Huh.\\n\\nSnoke\\, has no back story.  No character development.  Nothing at all to give the audience any idea as to why they should be afraid of him.  Where did he come from?  Who is he?  How did he learn how to use the Dark Side of the Force so successfully\\, and from whom?  None of this is explained.\\n\\nRey spends most of her time sleeping outside of Luke's steel door\\, like a lost puppy looking for scraps.  When she finally wears down Luke\\, she spends a whole 5 minutes \\\"training\\\"\\, and is off to kill what we are told is the most powerful member of the Dark Side.\\n\\nAs a result of all this\\, the audience is left to simply cock their head and go \\\"Huh.\\\" when Rey and Snoke meet.  We have a girl with no Jedi training\\, and who\\, five minutes ago it seems\\, was entirely clueless as to what the Force is\\, fighting the very personification of evil.  This personification of evil though (Snokes)\\, has no back story\\, no character development\\, no rhyme or reason as to why he is doing what he is doing\\, or why he is who he is.\\n\\nWhat else is the audience left to do\\, other than shrug and say \\\"Huh.\\\" when these two meet?\\n\\nI'm already tired of typing\\, but one last thing:\\n\\nIf you feel like being lectured to for nearly three hours on such varied things as racism\\, sexism\\, gender identification\\, capitalism-is-evil\\, meat-is-murder\\, and half a dozen other political hot button issues\\, this is the movie for you.\\n\\nIf you are a woman\\, you will feel empowered\\, knowing that every leadership position in the Resistance is female.  The main male protagonist is a testosterone-laced meathead\\, and spends most of his time being lectured by the womyn as if he were a petulant 5 year old\\, being upbraided by his mother and sisters.\\n\\nOverall\\, I seriously question the motives of this director\/writer.  I'm not sure how you can screw up a fairy-tale type story such as Star Wars\\, but he's done an admirable job.  In the end\\, it seems like he had several agendas\\, not the least annoying of which was to inject political correctness\\, and social justice warrior blather\\, into what could and should have been a rollicking good time.  \\n\\nCongrats you Hollywood douchebags - you've done it again.","true":true}
