Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My favorite SW film. It took some risks and added nuance to our ideas about the Force. I was emotionally completely captivated by this movie. This movie took the story away from the nostalgia factory of TFA\\, which was SO nice. Visually\\, it was fantastic. The music? John Williams will never disappoint. There's only one bit of the film that I question\\, but it doesn't take away from the movie enough for me to take away a star. Rian Johnson did an amazing job and gave us a fresh and deep new take. This SW fan greatly approves.","true":true}
