Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie\\, it has a few flaws as any movie does\\, but it's one of the best movies I've seen! My husband and I already preordered it\\, and we would gladly spend money to see it in theaters to get our fix while waiting for our copy on blue ray. \\nI have been a huge start wars fan for over 20 years\\, I grew up watching the older movies over and over with my brothers. Go see it with an open mind\\, and don't listen to either side (it being good vs. It being bad) think for yourself??. It's work your time!","true":true}
