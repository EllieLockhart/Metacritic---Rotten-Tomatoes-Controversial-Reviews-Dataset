{"101487":158939,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay I had to write this review because I am seeing all these people saying how this movie is one of the best in the \\\"Star Wars Universe.\\\" HUGE SPOILER ALERT: I DON\\\"T THINK THIS MOVIE BELONGS IN THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE.\\n\\nFirst of all\\, there was so much packed in to the two and a half hour movie\\, that I don't even know what actually happened.  Looking back on it\\, nothing really happened.  The entire movie was an elongated chase scene with side scenes that really did not matter.\\n\\nRose (Finn's companion) was a waste of a character and of screen time and so was their journey to the casino planet.  On this casino planet they happen to be placed in a cell with one of three people who can apparently unlock anything.  Okay\\, fine\\, luck is a thing\\, this could happen.  However\\, we were already introduced to one of the other three that could do this\\, MAZ!  Maz was one of my favorite additions to Episode 7 because she was someone who offered a huge upside of information and back stories.  Where did she get Luke's lightsaber? Who is Rey? Who is Snoke? (The two biggest questions OF THE MOVIE THAT DIDN'T GET ANSWERED.  If you think Rey's parents are nothing but junkyard scum you are wrong.  Anyways\\, that wipes out two unnecessary characters and a useless side plot.\\n\\nNow on to Rey.  Her existence is precedented by Luke in Episode 4\\, they should be pretty much the same character skill wise.  How many times does Luke use the force in the original trilogy? Like\\, three times.  Once to try (unsuccessfully) to lift an X-Wing out of Yoda's swamp and twice to obtain his lightsaber during a duel (I am probably missing some but obviously they weren't that key in the plot as I have forgotten them).  This movie relied WAY to heavily on the force to provide viewer entertainment.  Yes\\, it is very cool to see Rey move all those boulders and have the resistance first lay eyes on her as she performs this feat\\, but where was the training? How can she do this?  In Attack of the Clones\\, Yoda requires 100% of his focus to stop a pillar from crushing Obi-Wan and Anikan\\, leaving Dooku and saving them.  Yoda was the most gifted Jedi in his knowledge of the force\\, and you are telling me that Rey can move something of similar weight with no training at all?\\n\\nOkay\\, I know you're saying\\, \\\"but she had training with Luke on the island.\\\" No\\, she didn't.  She sat on a rock and explored the entire island with her mind and that was really the extent of what Luke told her.\\n\\nNow on to Luke.  I really disliked the way his character took shape.  I understand he is resistant to training Rey because of what happened to Kylo\\, but a lot of the scenes just seemed overly dramatic and poorly written.  As a group we had been waiting to see what Luke did with his lightsaber when Rey handed it to him\\, and he just tosses it aside and walks away?  It seemed as though they were trying too hard for comedy at this point\\, especially after the awkwardly drawn out scene between Poe and General Hux.  \\n\\nBut back to the island\\, Yoda magically appears.  Now don't get me wrong\\, I am a HUGE Yoda fan\\, but I almost booed when I saw him the CGI was awful\\, the puppet in the originals looks better.  That really doesn't matter very much but what does matter is his purpose in the movie.  I thought it was a good place to include Yoda (fan service\\, excitement\\, etc...) until he conjures up lightning.  First\\, since when have Jedi been able to control the weather?  (Lightning is also a Sith trait but with Yoda's mastery of the force okay I believe he has explored it\\, but it doesn't emanate from him\\, he straight up controls the weather).  This leads me to question\\, why isn't there an army of Jedi ghosts that sporadically appear and use the force to destroy the first order?  Including ghost Yoda's impact on real life completely ruins the purpose behind the Jedi ghosts.  Throughout the Original Trilogy\\, Obi-Wan's ghost is there simply to guide Luke through his decisions.  By Yoda making physical impacts\\, it ruins that dynamic because Obi-Wan (or Yoda) could have simply appeared behind the emperor and killed him.\\n\\nAnother issue I had was with Kylo Ren killing Snoke.  My biggest question coming into the movie was \\\"WHO IS SNOKE?!\\\" After seeing his impressive display of the force infront of Rey and Kylo\\, I was more excited than ever to find out who he was and where he came from.  Alas\\, he was killed a minute later\\, leaving me with a HUGE prequel feel (as all of the prequel villains are killed off after seeing them for the second time ie: Darth Maul\\, Jango Fett\\, Count Dooku\\, General Grevious).  I understand what they were trying to do\\, develop Kylo Ren's character and give the audience a sense of what he was feeling.  I have no idea what he was feeling.  He kills Snoke then fights alongside Rey so I presume he has switched over\\, then asks Rey to join him?  \\\"Join....what? You command the first order now? I thought we were going to destroy them\\, like you were going to join me.\\\" then she says no and he is right back where he started\\, trying to kill her and all the resistance.  DONT YOU REGRET KILLING SNOKE NOW?! That whole dynamic didn't make any sense to me because I didn't see any motive for Kylo to kill Snoke.  He literally just kills him then continues on like nothing happened.  Snoke turned out to be another worthless character because we never saw him call the shots or in a position of power until right before he died.\\n\\nNow for the final scene.  Really all I can say is \\\"what...?\\\" Luke's x-wing was featured (seen underwater) on the island.  When I first saw it I immediately had a flash to Empire and thought \\\"oh\\, we are going to see him lift it up and succeed this time and it will be SOOOO cool and then he will fly to the resistance.\\\"  So when he first showed up at the base obviously I was disappointed that we didn't see him pull the x-wing out.  Then I saw his lightsaber and was like \\\"hmmmm... that was just destroyed soooo he made a different one that looks the same? OMG I BET IT WILL BE GREEN IM SO EXCITED\\\" nope. Thats when I knew something was wrong\\, the whole fight between them was pleasing whatever Luke had some prequel like dueling moves that was fun sure.  Until the end.  As he stood there with his lightsaber disengaged I told myself \\\"If he goes out the same way Obi-Wan did\\, I will be FURIOUS.\\\" then Kylo slashes through him and turns around and Luke is still there \\\"WHEW. I dodged a bullet oh my goodness he is still alive yay. wait.... that lightsaber just passed right.. like.. right through him\\, how did that happen?...?\\\" Then Luke disappears and is still on the island.  Again\\, In attack of the Clones\\, Yoda used ALL OF HIS POWER to stop a single pillar from falling.  Now\\, Jedi who haven't used the force in years can project a physical body across galaxies? no... Im sorry\\, no there is no way this could happen in the star wars universe.  Give him a Hidden Leaf Village Headband and teach him shadowclone jutsu.  This is not star wars.\\n\\nTHEN TO TOP IT ALL OFF!\\n\\nHE DIES LIKE OBI WAN!\\n\\nEXCEPT NOBODY EVEN TOUCHED HIM!\\n\\nHE JUST DISAPPEARS FOR NO REASON! DID HE OVERDOSE ON THE FORCE? IS THAT POSSIBLE? WHAT HAPPENED?! \\n\\nSo yeah I left the theater extremely unsatisfied.  It was a good standalone film\\, but if you want to connect it to the \\\"Star Wars Universe\\\" you are going to have a lot of problems.  It is unfair that Star Wars movies are held to such a high regard but this movie fell well short of what it takes to be a Star Wars movie.  With no direction or plot development\\, we have no idea where the ninth movie will start or where it will lead to the closure of this trilogy.  I am placing this even with Attack of the Clones as the Second Worst Star Wars Movie strictly because it was entertaining.  I still believe even with its problems that Attack of the Clones had a better plot and that the audience learned something from watching the film (where stormtroopers come from and thats about it). But that just shows how worthless The Last Jedi was.\\n\\nPS: About the whole lightspeed flying into the star destroyer destruction scene.  I have thought about this a lot before the movie came out in terms of:\\n\\n\\\"How do people in light speed not crash into things\\\" \\n\\nWell\\, obviously\\, when moving at lightspeed you dont crash into things because you come out of lightspeed alive.  So if anyone can let me know if they think I am missing something or has a reason for why she was able to make contact with the Star Destroyer\\, please let me know because that still doesn't make sense to me.","true":true}
