Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see this movie even after I had read and viewed many of the reviews online. I am very disappointed that the producers\\, writers\\, and director have ignored what suggestions Mark Hamill had for Luke Skywalker.  It seems these days that the \\\"new\\\" talent in Hollywood is more about making money while disrespecting and neglecting the fans and the talented actors who created the roles decades ago.  There was so much taken from the Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi that I was wondering why this film was being billed as something new and exciting.  I think what has happened is the new kids want to be PC and change all of the things about Star Wars to appeal to everyone and make as mush money as they can before moving on to ruin more films. It is disgraceful and I wish they would listen to the actors and fans and make the films much more like the original Star Wars.","true":true}
