Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, never voted on a film before but felt obliged to after seeing this abomination of a film. Take everything you love about a saga and throw it away to push your own political views. Star Wars died with this film. Shame on you Rian Johnson and Disney","true":true}
