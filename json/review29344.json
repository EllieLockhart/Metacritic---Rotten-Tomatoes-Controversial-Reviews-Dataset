Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson bumbles the perfect layup given to him by JJ Abrams\\, and in my opinion ruined the new trilogy. The move is beautiful and looks like a star wars movie. But its faithfulness ends there. All of the original trilogy characters are discarded like unwanted toys so Rian can tell his \\\"so 2017\\\" story. Luke is not Luke\\, Leah is not Leah and the plot misses the mythic archetypes that made Star Wars great. The story is also super political. There's even a purple haired gender studies professor who gives a speech about the \\\"oppresed\\\" and defeating cosmic injustice. I related much more with Kylo than Mary Sue Rae. Rian Johnson ruined everything Abrams setup and I wish the whole movie could be redone.","true":true}
