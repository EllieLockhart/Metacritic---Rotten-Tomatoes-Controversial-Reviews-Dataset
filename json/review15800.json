Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars. All of it. I was 9 years old in 1977 and it captured my imagination. That freighter\\, cruising across the screen\\, seeming like it would never end. Yes. That. I was hooked. After \\\"Empire\\,\\\" I debated endlessly with friends and foes alike whether Darth Vader really was\\, really COULD be\\, Luke's father. And I cheered in \\\"Jedi Returns\\\" when he said \\\"I love you\\\" and she replied \\\"I know.\\\"\\n\\nThis movie is the best. THE BEST. Of them all. Yes\\, it has a plot. Yes\\, it has an arc. No\\, the arc is not complete because there will be another movie. (Three acts\\, remember.) Yes\\, the WOMEN tell the MEN to sit down and shut up and let the ladies fly the cruiser. What's wrong with that? No\\, we didn't learn that Rey was the long-lost daughter of an all-powerful Jedi. What is wrong with that? Yes\\, Luke is grumpy. What's wrong with that?\\n\\nGo see this film. Watch it. Watch it again. Listen to what the characters are telling you. It's not politically correct. It's just Correct.","true":true}
