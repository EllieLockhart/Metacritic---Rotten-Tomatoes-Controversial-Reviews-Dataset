Every single chapter of the game was a necessary and pleaseable (in some weird way sometimes\\, got be honest). The mechanics\\, the script\\, the delivery of every single line was on point\\, and when I say on point I mean pure perfect understanding the possibilities and the story beeing told . Saying that\\, makes me completely saddened to see the mostly irrational backlash that the game and the creators are receiving\\, I believe a lot of that comes from  a place of prejudice (like homophobia)\\, and because of that I am truly grateful for the creators for beeing bold enough to do a realistic and inclusive and necessary game. As a female gamer\\, makes me enormously satisfied to see true representations of female characters and bodies\\, to see true wlw relationships beeing portrayed. So\\, for all of that and a lot that is not being told here\\, thank you.
