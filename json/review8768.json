Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For every positive thing about the movie\\, there seemed to be a scathing negative. And this is coming from a fan who doesn't think the \\\"prequels ruined Star Wars\\\"; they just tried to hard-barely anything felt organic. It's really unfortunate. The whole movie feels like a setup for another movie instead of a story that's naturally progressing. Again\\, really unfortunate.","true":true}
