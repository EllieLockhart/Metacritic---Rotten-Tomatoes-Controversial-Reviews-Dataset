Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is my first review but feel compelled to comment. This is an awful Star Wars movie\\, the storyline is weak\\, sub plots have no consequence and characters are poorly developed. There are so many cringe inducing moments. The first bombing scene set the tone for the whole movie\\, it was meaningless scene of no consequence despite all the apparent tension and explosions. I went in with high expectations and hope DIsney listen to the audience feedback and change the whole direction the franchise is moving in. One of the worst movies I've watched in a long time. I cannot understand how the critics have rated it so highly.","true":true}
