Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many weaknesses in plot\\, blatant plot holes that are too many to list in this review\\, complete disregard for continuity and important elements of the story and state of the galaxy are not explained. These are very evident story telling and film making mistakes that any self respecting movie viewer should not ignore or forgive.\\n\\nThere are explanation for some plot holes\\, but they are not included in the film. You have to buy the books to fill in the gaps.\\nThe movie ignored many of the clear set ups and developing story lines from Episode 7 and neglected the responsibility of a sequel. This movie tried so hard to be different that the story suffered from it.\\n\\nThe villains are pretty much cartoon characters who can't do anything properly. They might as well replace General Hux with a punching bag.\\nBB-8 is too overpowered for a droid\\, saving characters in ridiculous ways because the plot needs them to be saved.\\nJokes are forced into way too many scenes\\, resulting in a lack of both drama and substance to the scene.\\n\\nThe stalemate chase plot is a horrible mess. The movie somehow had to extend the plot somehow\\, so they go on a contrived and pointless casino side quest. That's lazy writing at its finest.\\n\\nThe male characters are usually shown as arrogant\\, unstable\\, and choosing the wrong decision every time.\\nMeanwhile\\, the female characters are shown as calm\\, focused\\, never making a mistake\\, and never facing any adversity.\\n\\nPolitical statements are hammed in with no subtlety. They make a speech about capitalism and the wealthy\\, but overall\\, it is an ineffective statement that won't teach viewers anything they don't already know. They may as well have made Rose stare into the camera while making a speech while the American flag waved behind her.\\n\\nForced romantic subplot between Rose and Finn. She falls in love with him in a matter of hours despite them not showing any romantic chemistry at all.\\nPorgs are given way too much screen time even though they don't affect the plot in any way.\\nFinn\\, a stormtrooper who has only experienced one mission in which he did nothing\\, defeats Phasma\\, a skilled warrior and high ranking officer. Amazing.\\nWaste of characters\\, waste of lore and mythos\\, waste of world building.\\n\\nThe film prioritizes subverting fan expectations over good storytelling. Twists in a movie are good\\, but not when you do just for the sake of pulling the rug under the fans' feet. It's surprising how the writers thought they could get away with this many plot holes in 2017.\\n\\nVisually stunning. Some of the best CGI you will ever see. All praises when it comes to the visuals.\\nThe \\\"critics\\\" on this site are either bribed or drugged. \\nIf you removed \\\"Star Wars\\\" from the title and showed this script to a film professor\\, he would fail you from his class.","true":true}
