Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Defiantly Not for everyone. Only star wars fans hate star wars this much. Messes with some aspects of the lore but overall it shuts down the unnecessary speculation\\, don't get me wrong I love speculation but it's only because you build it up to be such a great twist that your disappointed. We knew nothing of the Emperor in the original films and everyone let's that slide. episode 4 and 5 were fresh new ideas and things never seen before and now that someone tried to continue with new ideas he gets crussified.","true":true}
