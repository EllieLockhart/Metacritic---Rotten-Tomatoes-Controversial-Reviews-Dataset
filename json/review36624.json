Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie is a slap in the face to fans.\\n\\nNo explanations\\, huge gaps in the plot\\, the casino planet oh wow... dull boring. Bad humor...after people have been killed ( BB8s beeping after 1 scene) ... Leia is now more powerful than any sith or jedi that has ever lived... with no force training.\\n\\nThere is a ton of social adgenda messages in this movie. Men ...more or less are stupid\\, evil or ..in the way.  The casino planet... the implied message is all rich people are bad and evil\\, for not give all the money they make to other people.\\n\\nLuke Skywlaker.... oh wow..... it is a disgrace.\\n\\nI could go on and on\\, and in my FB I have.\\n\\nHonestly\\, I can not say how much of a disapointment this was.  For me\\, it has ruined the legacy.  I never expected to see this kind of crap from a star wars movie.","true":true}
