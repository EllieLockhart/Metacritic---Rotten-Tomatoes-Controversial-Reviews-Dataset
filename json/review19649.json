Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a disappointment; the way they depicted the original characters didn't really make much sense. The premise of the whole movie was a massive plot hole. (I'll try not to spoil it) but if you like car chases at 2km\/hr for no reason lasting 2 and a bit hours perhaps you'll like this movie. Visually it produced 1 or 2 decent scenes but even then they felt forced. There was a huge lack of consistency both in plot and character decisions with very little logic or explanations. \\n\\nThe kylo ren performance was decent I suppose.\\n\\nI'd say it's around a 1.8\/10.","true":true}
