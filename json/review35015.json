Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film will be looked at differently 10 years from now\\, it was truly amazing filmmaking. Would I have liked to have known who the hell Snoke actually was\\, of course\\, that was a missed opportunity. I do not believe for a minute Rey's parents were who Ren claimed them to be.","true":true}
