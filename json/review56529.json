Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi bastardizes the Star Wars franchise and its characters. While I enjoyed it in the theatre\\, my excitement quickly faded into anger and dismay\\, after the \\\"nostalgia googles\\\" wore off. The more I thought about the movie\\, the more I realized major plot points made no sense and how out of character the characters were. You will be severely disappointed by how mysteries from The Force Awakens are just dropped.\\n\\nI read an article where Rian Johnson said there were moments when he was writing the script where he said to himself \\\"A ha! Gotcha.\\\" He seems to like messing with the audience to the point of trolling them. What's worse is he sacrifices substance and believability just to fool you. Who cares if it makes no sense?! He tricked you and that's all that matters. Not cool.\\n\\nDisney is going down a very dark path; one that many fans will not follow.","true":true}
