Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What the hell were they thinking? Months after seeing it I'm still gutted. No film has ever disappointed me so much and I so wanted to love it. I really liked Force Awakens and Solo was great but this was the cinematic equivalent of a turd. In fact a dog turd. The worst type of turd.","true":true}
