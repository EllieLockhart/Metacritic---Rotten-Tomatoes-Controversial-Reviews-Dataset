Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Right off the bat\\, this is a frustratingly bad movie. There are so many glaring inconsistencies\\, it it hard to keep track. Where to start? Perhaps it is better to look at where do we end up. Spoilers ahead\\, by way of 1977. The Republic is over and most of the old leaders are gone. They are now to be led by a plucky rogue\\, an honor bound soldier\\, and a Jedi. The Empire has lost it's mega weapon but controls the galaxy and is led by the dark side. One side is on the run and the other chases\\, but it all feels so much a frail shadow of past greatness rather than a triumphant middle leading to an exciting future. This is movie that begs us to think of Empire when we watch it\\, but truly makes me feel more like The Phantom Menace when I walked out. If you haven't seen it yet\\, wait for Netflix\\, it's not worth the rental.","true":true}
