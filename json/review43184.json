Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This should not have been rated this high. Trust the audience score. This contains about 30 minutes and out-of-place jokes that are borderline parody. I would rate this above Episode I and II but below III and VII.. and honestly on par or just below Rogue One. I would have been so much happier to wait for the library release.","true":true}
