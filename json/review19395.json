Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's safe to say that this is not the Star Wars film we were expecting but that being said it was still very enjoyable. The journey of the new characters is fun to watch\\, however some of the important questions from episode VII we're answered in the worst way possible and I am hoping that these are just red herrings! \\nGreat visuals\\, all in all a good\\, fun film.","true":true}
