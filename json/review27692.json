Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pelicula horrible. Da\u00c3\u00b1aron a personajes como Finn\\, perdieron 30 minutos en el planeta del casino en una secuencia sin importancia. Da\u00c3\u00b1aron las teorias interesantes de Snoke. Destruyeron toda la resistencia. Mataron al personaje mas positivo y esperanzador de la saga\\, aunque se encargaron de da\u00c3\u00b1ar el personaje antes de matarlo. Siguen sin entenderse los poderes de Rey. Se olvidaron de los caballeron de Ren. Y un largo etc de incoherencias.","true":false}
