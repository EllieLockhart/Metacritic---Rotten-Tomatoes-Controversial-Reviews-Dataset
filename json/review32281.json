Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars fans:We hope Rian doesn't make a rehash of Empire Strikes Back.\\nRian Johnson:okay \\,we won't.\\nStar Wars fans after seeing movie:we didn't mean like this! This feels nothing like Star Wars.Too many jokes\\,Leia using the Force in space\\,all of our icons are destroyed.We didn't mean this.Oh\\,no! Rian and Disney have destroyed Star Wars.\\nMe:most Star Wars fans are idiots who can't enjoy anything put out for Star Wars.Expanded Universe idiots who hate everything put out now.I don't care\\,go see it\\,don't go see it.We don't want your snarky butts sitting beside us in heaters anyway.For the rest that care\\,it's a good Star Wars movie that burns down all the iconoclasm of the previous movies.","true":true}
