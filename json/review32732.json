Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi Pros: - Fantastic Acting - Amazing Directing - Terrific Script - Beautiful Cinematography - Magnificent Editing - Great VFX - Decent Pacing - Very Emotionally resonant\\, while also very funny - Loving tribute to Carrie Fisher - Good Action Scenes - More fun the 2nd time around Cons: - None Overall Grade: A+ (10\/10)","true":true}
