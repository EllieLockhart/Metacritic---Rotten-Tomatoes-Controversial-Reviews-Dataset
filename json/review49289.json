Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst star wars movie since \\\"attack of the clones\\\"  All over the place plot. Terrible comedic timing and the writing was just lazy and amaturish.  Rian Johnson does not know how to write a star wars moive period! He should be fired and not allowed anywhere near a new trillogy.  He is completley clueless\\, the decisions on what to do with what characters left me scratching my head.  I do not want to spoil for anyone who has not seen this but set very low expectations. JJ has his work cut out to fix this train wreck of a movie in the next installment. If Kathleen Kennedy let's that idiot Rian have a new trillogy she should be fired along with Rian Johnson.","true":true}
