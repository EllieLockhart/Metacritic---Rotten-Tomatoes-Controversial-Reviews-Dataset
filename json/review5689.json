{"101487":115669,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-06","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did the professional critics watch the same movie I watched?!\\n(POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD)\\nLet's take this as a movie and not a Star Wars movie.As a movie was a bad movie.Bad writing and execution.A series of events that all fail in their story arc\\, glued together in a plot that basically tells nothing.You can say whatever you want about The Force Awakens\\,but at least the movie had a more consistent narrative taking the viewer from point A to D passing from B and C with a cohesive story-telling that flowed smoothly.More smoothly that this movie at least.\\n-Bombs dropping in a no gravity environment?They didn't even care to call them\\,for instance\\, \\\"gravity bombs\\\"or\\\"magnetic bombs\\\"to imply a technology.(it has been explained now in a book I guess\\, but nonetheless the movie fails in being self-explanatory in the simple things).\\n-The whole chase at sub-light speed was a joke.The first order could have made a few ships jump out and jump back in front of the resistance fleet or scramble all the tie fighters and bombers they had to finish them off\\, not to mention that they could have use the light speed jump weapon solution themselves..\\n-Ships out of fuel in Star Wars?Since when?U.S. oil obsession served.Ships out of fuel that stop and start to float in the vacuum of space?!Do asteroids do that?Did the probes Voyager 1&2 do that after depleting their fuel reserves and still traveling on their trajectories\\, 40 years after their launch?Not to mention the proximity of a planet(the old rebel base one) with its gravitational pull..\\n-Flat and underdeveloped characters.Rey\\,Finn and Poe felt like a pale copy of their former selves.Poe now acts like a hot headed teenager. A pilot leader who fought many battles and led squadrons and comrades\/friends into danger\\, doesn't understand chain of command nor battle strategy?Who can buy that?!\\n-The Vice Admiral Holdo vs Poe confrontation is stupid and useless and yet again not believable.\\nFirst of all\\, only a few hundreds of Resistance left and he does not know who is the chain of command? He must have seen a few times a lady with purple hair walking around from one office to another. He never asked to Leia or himself at least who the hell she was?\\nMoving on..What Commander does not tell to his subordinate officers the plan\\, also considering Poe is one of the few left? Instead she mocks him by underlining his recent demotion\\, being very well aware that she is talking with what is depicted as a hot headed guy.It would have saved the story from the unnecessary mutiny plot and redeem Poe as a character watching him working together with his superiors to grant the success of the mission.\\n-Holdo commits an unnecessary suicide\\, the ship could have been set to a light speed jump in autopilot\\, but If you really can't keep yourself from suiciding a character at least do it as soon as you see the first transport being blown off...\\nDo not forget that this sets anyway a problem. The first Death Star could have been easily destroyed in the same way\\, making basically the first trilogy irrelevant and Rogue One unnecessary.\\nYou wanted to destroy the past Ryan? You did it. Well done!!!\\nThe Finn-Rose subplot(the horrible Casino scene) was unnecessary\\, they didn't accomplished what they went there for(like any of the other subplots) and didn't serve the general plot in any way\\, not to mention Phasma's appearance\\,just thrown in there in the middle\\, 'cause..why not?\\n-Dumb\\,childish and immature male characters overall\\, with the only purpose to serve as highlighting tool for female roles.\\nI have no problem in strong female character leads\\,I totally welcome that(we all played Tomb Raider back in the 90s ffs!)\\,but has to be balanced with believable and solid male character or the narrative suffers. And it does.\\n-Even Luke acts like a stubborn 3 years old kid:\\\"Eat the veggies dear\\\"\\\"NO!\\\"\\,\\\"They're good for you\\\"\\\"NO!\\\"\\,\\\"Just eat a few not the whole plate\\\"\\\"NO!NO!NO!\\\".\\n\\\"Help me Luke!\\\"\\\"NO!\\\"\\,\\\"The Resistance needs you\\\"\\\"NO!\\\"\\\"Your Sister needs you\\\"\\\"NO!NO!NO!\\\"\\n-The worst part though is the Total denial of Luke's spiritual journey and achievements.\\nThe same guy willing to sacrifice himself just cause he saw a little light(hope)in the unredeemable Darth Vader\\,now acts out of fear(!) willing to kill his nephew cause he saw he was leaning to the Dark side?!What teacher acts like this when a pupil of his goes off track?It is not the teachers way and certainly not a Jedi Master like Luke Skywalker who knows well that:\\\"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.\\\"\\, as Master Yoda always taught.\\nPlus I don't see any genius writing behind the big middle finger Ryan gave to J.J.'s setups(Rey's parents\\,Snoke\\,the passing of the lightsaber i.e.)\\,it's just admitting:\\\"I really don't know what to do with all this\\,soooo...let's just skip it!!\\\".You don't look cool or smart by doing this dear Ryan Johnson & Johnson. It's just lazy and sloppy.\\n-Let the past die. Fine with that\\, you need to break with the past to move onto new things\\, but make the past actually look like the past with its set of rules\\, dogmas\\, ethics and history to make relevant and meaningful the change for the future. The new has to stand out compared to everything the old represents. Just by saying that the past needs to be eradicated and by portraying it completely stripped from the features that define it\\, it's utterly ineffective and simplistic.\\nThe \\\"Story\\\" ends with Kylo Ren even more rooted in his quest for power and in his dark side love\\, while Rey is still the paladin of the Light and a super capable Jedi\\, even without any sort of training(Doh!).\\nThe movie had a chance to redeem itself a bit  and be a real rule breaker when Kylo was faced with the choice of joining Rey\\, but no\\, he goes back to the same character he was a movie ago\\, changing nothing that The Force Awakens already established.\\nI stop here because there is much more to say.","true":true}
