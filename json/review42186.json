Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie shit on all the potential plot advancements that JJ put in place from force awakens\\, killed off the most interesting characters that we still knew nothing about and now never will.  So much horrible\\, and forced comedy\\, this movie couldn't be serious for more than 5 mins without throwing in some corny joke that found me covering my face in embarrassment and wondering why? This movie left JJ with nothing to work with for Ep.9.  I prey that they delay Ep.9 so that JJ can remake this movie  and we can forget this disaster ever happened","true":true}
