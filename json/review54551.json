Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"****I'm a Star Wars nerd. I love all of the Star Wars movies but this one**** After the movie I was excited and disappointed. After two weeks to think about it and break down the movie\\, I'm now very disappointed and not so excited for episode 9 that I was before The Last Jedi. However I'm very excited JJ is back. He understands Star Wars. TLJ flat out doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie. This feels like a whacky adventure thru Space. This movie flat out makes no sense. It's all over the place. What a waste of 2 hours and 32 minutes of screen time. List of characters that have weak and wasteful screen time... Snoke\\, Phasma\\, Poe\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, Maz. Best scenes in the movie are force ghost Yoda cameo and the throne room fight scene. Worst scenes are everything on canto bight seriously go use the restroom moment of the movie\\, all of DJ's scenes\\, Leia force resurrection\\, Poe & Holdo scenes. This movie makes me really appreciate The Force Awakens. JJ is our only hope for this trilogy now. R. Johnson should not have his own trilogy\\, period.","true":true}
