The story indeed takes a darker turn but still have some very beautiful moments to balance out all the lows. This story captivates the reality and practicality of the situation the characters are in and tough choices they had to make in them. These choices also have consequences that cannot be undone.Without spoiling the story\\, I would just say that the game lays out different perspective of the characters and justifies the path they take.This is a very emotional journey that I recommend anyone with a PS4 to experience.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
