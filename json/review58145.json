Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, really bad. Hard to believe a blockbuster franchise would have such bad writing. No real reasons for any of the characters actions\\, a slow speed chase through space. Luke is a scared puppy who wont train Rey\\, Leia had a chance to go out a hero\\, but is a coward and lets another go down with the ship. In a franchise with such great final battles and memorable lines\\, \u201cLuke\\, Im your Father\u201d\\, \u201cI have the High Ground\/ you were the chosen one\\, Anakin\u201d \\, \u201c if you strike me down Darth\\, I will become far more powerful\u201d in the end Ren taunts Luke about the jedis utter ddeddded\\, we get \u201ceverything you just said is wrong\u201d aimed at getting laughs from 8 year olds... The whole movie has the joke\/ gag reel running full speed to appease the Teen\/ Disney crowd\\, and that is what this movie is\\, a sad joke.","true":true}
