Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The people giving this 4-5 stars need to be rounded up and frozen in carbonite so we don't have to read your idiotic reasons for defending this film.  listing this as \\\"one of the best of franchise\\\" may actually fill me with more rage than the movie itself.  YOU ARE NOT STAR WARS FANS.","true":true}
