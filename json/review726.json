Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A natural progression. It felt like exactly where the saga should have gone. Very different from what people tend to expect\\, so I have little doubt that a lot of fans will hate it. But it was certainly a gripping experience\\, to say the least.\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed seeig where the new characters get to in their arcs. I feel that Rey still isn't super great as a character\\, but as a vessel to drive the story\\, she does fine. Finn is muted from his TFA appearance\\, but this works in his favor as he's a lot more openly tolerable and more enjoyable to watch. Poe gets the best end of the stick\\, going from more or less a side character to the star of the B-plot\\n\\nMy biggest complaint is a small one\\, and\\, to beat a dead horse\\, the porgs. They exist only to be \\\"adorable and hilarious\\\"\\, and only for merchandising's sake. They added nothing to the film and honestly\\, took away from it on some level. The audience laughed at their antics while I shook my head.","true":true}
