{"101487":156892,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-13","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not a perfect film by any sense\\, and I understand a lot of the criticism but I don't agree with most of it. Canto Bight was for the most part unnecessary \/ could have been done better\\, Rey's powers need serious explanation\\, but every other criticism I've seen for the film can be explained away. \\nFinn \/ Rose: established at the beginning that Rose sees Finn as a hero. They have a fun (from the characters' perspectives) adventure together. Rose experiences a whirlwind of emotion from the loss of her sister\\, hopelessness of the Resistance fleet\\, elation of being their potential saviour\\, being locked up in jail\\, freeing all the horse things\\, almost completing their mission\\, almost being killed\\, crash landing back with the Resistance\\, and being on the frontline suicide mission to stop the First Order. In one day she goes from being a technician to an adrenaline fuelled hero of the Resistance\\, the whole time joined by Finn. Of course she's gonna feel some strong emotions towards him by the end\\, and he clearly didn't kiss her back in that moment because he's not as overwhelmed as she is having experienced all of this before\\nLuke: having put a stop to the Empire and established his own order in peaceful (ish) times for about 20 years or so\\, one day it dawns on him that evil is back. and it's his nephew. he raised a school to be the next generation\\, he's old\\, he's already dealt with all this shit before\\, he's sick of his family turning evil\\, for a very brief moment he's consumed by darkness (just like that time he exploded at his dad and very almost killed him). this darkness lasts about 5 seconds\\, whereas last time it was a good couple of minutes. that's a pretty big improvement I'd say\\, and even Luke Skywalker can't be a perfect man with no mistakes. anyway his mistake costs him his nephew\\, all his students\\, everything he's worked so hard to build for a couple of decades. makes sense to me that he'd be sick of this shit and runs away from it all. from his perspective he's just created Vader 2\\, and he saw first hand what Vader 1 did. surprised he didn't kill himself after that tbh. as for the ending\\, it's already established that Rey couldn't be behind her and Kylo's link because she's \\\"not powerful enough\\, it would destroy (her)\\\". so to project oneself across the entire galaxy\\, to the entire resistance and first order troops\\, for so long\\, through the power of the mind\\, especially after only just reconnecting to the force after a good few years\\, is probably a SUPER hard thing to do\\nHoldo \/ Poe: Poe was demoted to captain after getting a load of people killed\\, he's in no authority to be disclosed every piece of information. simple as that\\nSnoke: Just like the Emperor in ep 5 & 6\\, there was no time or relevance in this story to delve into who this guy is. There'll be a comic series or a book devoted to that\\, which all the hardcore fans can read because the average movie goer probably doesn't care that much anyways\\nPorgs: after the entire galaxy was saved by Ewoks\\, I'm surprised there's anything said about the little things that did nothing major for the story other than making Chewie feel a little guilty. Course they were made to sell toys\\, but at least they weren't the reason the First Order was defeated\\nTimeline: Rey and Luke's arc was clearly picked up from the second TFA ended\\, but there's no reason to suggest there wasn't at least a week in between Rey leaving the Resistance and the First Order finding them. It's perfectly plausible that the chase sequence arc started a few days after the Rey \/ Luke arc\\, which also explains Finn's recovery\\nSuper Leia: yeah\\, it looked dumb as hell. but it's always been established that Leia's in touch with the force\\, and despite other movies showing the opposite\\, it's scientifically accurate that you wouldn't die the second you enter space. Not that Star Wars needs to be\\, or has ever been entirely scientifically accurate. also when entering the ship again\\, the smoke when the door opens suggests an air lock to me. I'd need to watch again to know if that's the case\\nBlue milk: the way I read this the very first time I saw it\\, was Luke staring into Rey's eyes to say \\\"look how gross I am. fuck off\\\"\\nPoe \/ Hux joke: Han did something very similar when they broke Leia out of detention cell 2187. Hux was dumb but it's been established outside of the movies that he gained his position because of his dad\\, and likes to take a back seat in war. He's supposed to be a pathetic slimy dirtbag \\nI'll admit\\, Phasma was a waste again\\, Kylo's abdomen injury was forgotten (or perhaps fixed offscreen because do you need to see every single detail?)\\, some of the CGI was jarring\\, DJ was a whatever character and the tone was very distracting at times. But I'd happily watch this movie every day if I had to and still enjoy it","true":true}
