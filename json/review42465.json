Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a huge disappointment and singlehandedly managed to ruin the legacy of Luke Skywalker\\, a beloved childhood character after generations of careful and considered development.  The movie was not all bad-- for example\\, the movie had good special effects and beautiful scenes at times; Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren and Mark Hamill's performance as the character he was forced to be were very good-- but in the end\\, this movie did not feel like \\\"Star Wars\\\".  Why could Rey who had very little to no training at all easily defeat Luke Skywalker who was a Master Jedi who actually did train with a master as well as defeat a throne room full of praetorian guards (albeit with Kylo Ren's help) also trained to defend Snoke?  I can understand that they are saying that Rey has a lot of raw power\\, but that doesn't mean that she automatically knows how to levitate a mountain of boulders\\, use mind tricks and wield a light saber.  It has been well established that it takes much time and training to become proficient at using the Force\\, but not in this movie!  I get that they were trying to introduce the new characters and make them the focus of the movie\\, but Rian Johnson seemed to go against everything that was already established and purposely change things just to be different-- and this was all done to the detriment of the characters and the Star Wars mythos.  Why can Yoda\\, as a force ghost\\, conjure lightning to affect the real world?  If he can do that\\, why aren't other force ghosts fighting the First Order and vice versa?  Also\\, if Leia who was only force sensitive can fly back to the ship when she is blown out\\, why couldn't Emperor Palpatine keep himself from falling down the reactor shaft when Vader threw him down it?  It also seems that Rian Johnson purposely went out of his way to prove all of the online speculation and theories that surfaced after The Force Awakens wrong by coming up with the most ridiculous thing he could fathom and putting it in the movie.  Not only that\\, but it seems as if he gave JJ Abrams the finger by saying\\, \\\"I don't care about all of the plotlines you set up in The Force Awakens\\\" and proceeded to drop them with no answers.  Why did Luke leave a map to find him in The Force Awakens?  Why did he consider murdering his nephew that he only sensed darkness in while not giving up on his father Darth Vader who had actually murdered scores of people?  In the end\\, this movie managed to push me away from the Star Wars franchise as I will likely not be taking my family to see the next film in the series.  If the director is willing to do this to Luke Skywalker\\, why bother investing any time in any new characters?  If they are not going to remake this movie\\, the best thing Disney could do at this point is start the next movie by Luke coming to from a vision of clips from The Last Jedi after Rey hands him the light saber and Rey asking him\\, \\\"Luke\\, can you hear me?\\\"\\, to which he answers\\, \\\"I have to try to save them...\\\"","true":true}
