Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great cinematography which adds a story that allows the franchise the ability to move forward instead of clinging to the past. It goes in a direction that is totally unexpected and in turn provides one of the best additions to the saga. Poor reviews are due to people creating an image of what they expected from the film and when their expectations didn\u0092t match the film they were upset. I couldn\u0092t be happier with the film nor the performances in it. I\u0092m looking forward to more of Johnson\u0092s work related to the franchise.","true":true}
