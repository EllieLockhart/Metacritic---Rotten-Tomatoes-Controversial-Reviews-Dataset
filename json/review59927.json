The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"One of the worst sequailre sequel I played since playing games.\rLet's start with part the game did good. Gameplay envolved a little from 1\\, sound\\, animation\\, light\\, texture\\, lod\\, vegetation and models\\, I can see a lot of effort has been put into making those.\rBut that's all good part. Next\\, I will need to discuss the donwside of the game.\r\\nFirst of all\\, I don't like the steel box'sOne of the worst sequailre sequel I played since playing games.\rLet's start with part the game did good. Gameplay envolved a little from 1\\, sound\\, animation\\, light\\, texture\\, lod\\, vegetation and models\\, I can see a lot of effort has been put into making those.\rBut that's all good part. Next\\, I will need to discuss the donwside of the game.\rFirst of all\\, I don't like the steel box's picture\\, and the front picture on the art work\\, already trying to show this is a hysteria game. All the character\\, only Joel kind of seem like Joel from 1\\, Tommy looks a little weird. Ellie is just weird. And she has very big personality problem\\, in short\\, she is an **** all the time.\rSecond\\, the pacing of the game is bad. Very bad. Even the story is boring and stupid\\, the game should last 20 hours max. However\\, it lasted 30 hours. You should expect a lot of filler content. Another problme enlarged by the pacing is the map design. Sure\\, the map looks great\\, but I got lost all the freaking time. This is something never happen in 1.\rThird\\, the story. In short\\, the story sucks\\, No matter you played 1 or not. At least\\, Abby's story should be in front of Ellies. Even that's still bad story. In this story\\, all the character in this game are insane.\rJoey\\, Ellie\\, Tommy\\, and Abby. All of thos character would do things out of the character all the time. Ellie and Abby are the worst. They are both unlikable\\, Abby is just ugly\\, unhumanly ugly\\, and ruthless or should I say evil?\rFour\\, camera swtiching. The camera swiching is bad and stupid. As a player\\, you will be forced into another storyline then memory of that story line multiple time. They are both boring and stupid\\, made the game's pacing very bad. Another problem caused by the camera switching is that\\, the emotion player build up during the gameplay\\, has nowhere to go. Very uncomfortable.\rFive\\, the story teller is mixing a lot things I like in this game\\, that don't make sense. Dina\\, Ellie's girlfriend is a gay. Even I don't mind gay\\, the way the game showed their love is\\, boring to be least and stupid. One of the story\\, they just found a weed house\\, then started to smoke weed and having sex. If you think that's bad\\, you are wrong. Dina is a likable person\\, but she has no real purpose in this story. So does Jesse. They are helping Ellie to revenge. What made it worse is that\\, Jessie is Dina's ex boyfriend\\, they break up 1 week ago. So Dina is pregranent of Jessie's child. Sorry\\, I don't really want to discuss this part anymore\\, too disgusting. However\\, Abby's friend Owen and Mel\\, they share similar relation as Elllie\\, Jessie and Dina.\rYou see\\, in 1\\, Joel and Eillie are the main hero. Since Joel did a lot of bad things\\, so it make sense he die some way. But not in this way. However\\, the director promised Eillie will be the only character we can play. The final game let you play Eille\\, then force you play a evil\\, ugly\\, unlikable charadcter\\, Abby\\, while killing Joel in the 2 hours of the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
