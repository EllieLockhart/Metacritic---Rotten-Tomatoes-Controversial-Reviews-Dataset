Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love all of the movies except this one. this is the first time I left the theater both happy and sad. On one hand the visuals are awesome. They did do a good job changing directions but here are my issues with this film: First the characters do not feel important. Difficult to connect with and all the lore and unanswered questions left me totally uninterested in anyone. The humor was awful and so many scenes felt like nonsense and just filler. Where there needed to be backstory we got none and where they should have spent time developing the main characters\\, they gave us plenty of unimportant side characters and stories that just felt completely out of touch with the movie. Rian and the writers created a trainwreck that I hope somehow can be redeemed. Unfortunately this movie just is not a good Star Wars film. Worth a watch but if you're a fan or really like the original story\\, this movie probably will make you frustrated and dissatisfied. ","true":true}
