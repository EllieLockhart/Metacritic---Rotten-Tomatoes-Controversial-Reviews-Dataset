Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film was a huge let-down. Many leaps in logic\\, force lore\\, wasted character potential and out of place jokes. The whole point about the last jedi was to inspire a new wave of rebels and jedi\\, however it is carried out poorly as all the rebellion does is flee and lose. Furthermore many important character were just killed off in a poor manner. Both Supreme leader Snoke and Luke were built up hype in the force awakens and trailer yet both have limited screen time\\, in which they do nothing\\, and them die. The whole second act (a.k.a Cantobright casino ) was useless as it was did not affect the plot despite having 3 important character in it and taking up a big chink of the movie. The whole movie was a mess and an overall let-down","true":true}
