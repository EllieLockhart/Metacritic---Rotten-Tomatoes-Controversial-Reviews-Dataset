Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No character development. Ruined every character except for Rey. Plot itself was awful and the pace was terrible. Lots of sideshows and useless twists that ultimately ruin the lineages that made the previous 7 Star Wars what they were. Very disappointed in Rian Johnson. ","true":true}
