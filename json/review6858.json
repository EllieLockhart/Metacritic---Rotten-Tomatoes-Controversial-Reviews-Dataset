Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do yourself a favor\\, watch this movie and judge for yourself. As a die-hard fan of Star Wars\\, I will admit this movie was quite a shock. Ultimately I found the movie extremely enjoyable and well worth the risks. There are some issues with certain aspects and for me one question regarding the plot that needs to be answered\\, but other than that this is a very good Star Wars film.\\n\\nMost of those who are trashing the movie had an unrealistic expectations and wanted the Star Wars film they imagined in their heads as opposed to one that makes sense and can appeal to the casual and die hard fan alike.\\n\\nGreat follow-up to The Force Awakens\\, and puts us in position for a truly unpredictable conclusion to this Saga!","true":true}
