Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll be honest... I've just signed up to Rotten Tomatoes for the first time simply because I cannot believe how poor this film is. Rian Johnson had it all set up to make a great movie as well as a great next chapter of this saga but instead contributed poor dialogue\\, a slapstick First Order\\, non-sensical character plots (not to mention a garbage plot that was basically some spaceships running away from some other spaceships)... and of course crapped all over the legacy of Luke Skywalker. Rian did however manage to succeed in one thing... he made George Lucas look like a master at dialogue writing LOL. For me Dec 15th 2017 was the day Star Wars died (and I was there at the very beginning).","true":true}
