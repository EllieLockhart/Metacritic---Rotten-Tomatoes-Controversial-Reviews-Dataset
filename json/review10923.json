Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Haters gonna hate. Fantastic visuals. Excellent story telling. Great plot twists. I loved it from start to finish. It's not without faults\\, but it's so much fun none of it bothers me that much.","true":true}
