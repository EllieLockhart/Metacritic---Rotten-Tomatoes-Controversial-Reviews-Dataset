Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's pretty disturbing to see some of these audience reviews because the movie was really good. It was by no means perfect and did have Its flaws\\, but it was more like the critics 94% than the 56% by the audience. It was a lot of fun!","true":true}
