Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked what they did with most of the characters\\, but the filmmaking felt rushed and not very Star Wars-y to me. It just didn't have that look\\, feel and pacing. I didn't feel that imagination-expanding Star Wars magic. It wasn't the downer of a storyline that was the problem - I think it was the constant\\, anticlimactic dramatic reveals. The plot was so complicated\\, so overloaded with lessons and themes\\, that I felt schooled rather than led on a journey. You don't have to dot every i and cross every t to drive your themes home. It was so ambitious a movie that it kinda toppled under its own weight. In TFA\\, I felt swept along by an exuberant story\\, but TLJ felt like work.","true":true}
