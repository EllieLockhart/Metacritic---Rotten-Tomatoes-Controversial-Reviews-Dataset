Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hated this movie the 1st time I watched it. I thought the pacing was way off - like 6 hours of content crammed into 3. I was offended that so much of what I thought was gonna happen didn't. \\n\\nI was perplexed at so many people's rave reviews. Not just the top critics. But my buddies\\, my coworkers\\, my husband. I didn't understand. \\n\\nAnd so I went to see it for a 2nd time. And boy was I wrong. It was an absolutely fantastic movie. Trust me\\, I love Star Wars. OT\\, the politics and more of PT\\, EU lore\\, HUGE KOTOR fan. I even love Attack of the Clones and Rebels. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is on par with ESB for me. The character arcs are fantastic. The acting top notch (I'm looking at you Driver). There's subtle parts that allude to what's going to happen later in the movie. Tons of details I missed on my first viewing. \\n\\nIf you guys really love Star Wars\\, I really think you ought to give this another chance. I promise you won't regret it. Try to watch it without any preconceptions and just let it ride out while you look at the details.","true":true}
