Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In a far galaxy of plotholes and SJW propaganda:\\n-Leia flying in the vacuum space. Hilarious!\\n-Luke an angry homeless and milk drinker from a chicken-cow-alien.\\n-Rey looking for Jedy training when Leia can fly in the vacuum space\\n-Worst bombers with gravity included ever forgetting the bomber was the Y-Wing.\\n-Poe and the main characters play with they lives  useless because the woman with the fancy hair didn\u00b4t tell them the plan\\, but the whole ship.\\n-Finn and Rose parking ilegally in a planet wasting 35 minutes of the movie for nothing.\\n-Toc\\, toc Who is? Snoke. Snoke who? you are dead.\\n-Rey you are nobody. \\n-Fancy woman with a nice haircut did not crash the ship before with a droid  piloting. She waited for being destroyed the rebel army.\\nAnd many many more plot holes. Disney had destroyed an epic history which was able to gather different generations together to its end. SJW propaganda which killed ghostbusters classic is here repeating the dissaster. \\nYou can make a woman a strong character\\, but interesting at the same time like Ripley in Alien or Alice in Resident evil. \\nAfter all\\, dark Disney side powerful is. This movie was bad even as a parody of Star Wars. No humour\\, no charisma\\, imposible-incoherent plot\\, political propaganda...Worst movie not only of Star Wars \\,but worse movie ever...","true":true}
