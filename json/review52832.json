Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of plot holes. All the setups that the \\\"force awaken\\\" has created crashes into a two and a half hours of bad writing. \\nStill you get a lot of great action\\, and pretty funny jokes. Just try not to get any sense form the direction of the plot and you actually will enjoy form that movie.","true":true}
