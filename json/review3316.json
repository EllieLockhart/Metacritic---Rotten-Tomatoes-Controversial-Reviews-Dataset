Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Before you call me a neckbeard fanboy\\, I just want to point out that I'm a girl and tired of these strong\\, badass female leads (like Rey) dominating Hollywood. The Last Jedi happens to be another addition to this nauseating trend. Here is my review: The Last Jedi is a lackluster\\, disappointing movie. Horrendous flat characters\\, unnecessary side plot\\, and contains poor dialogue. Yup\\, that's Disney's Star Wars for you! Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy definitely ruined our beloved\\, special franchise. If you don't see the flaws in this film\\, I assume you prefer quantity\\, not quality\\, Star Wars movies. 1\/2 out of 5 stars from me.","true":true}
