Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything that I felt when I was a little kid watching Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi rose up in me tonight when I saw The Last Jedi. I laughed! I cried! My mouth was opened in awe! I yelled with great excitement. I wasn't alone either. We all felt it. Different ethnicities\\, tax brackets\\, life preferences...all of us for two and a half amazing hours were bound by The Force. Brilliant!!!","true":true}
