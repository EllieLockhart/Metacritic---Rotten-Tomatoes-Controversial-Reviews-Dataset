The person who sold the used game disc to me is now a good friend with me\\, and we often discuss various games. But I can\u2019t believe that the wait of more than 5 years turned out to be such a sequel.\r\rI think most players can accept the elements of unreasonable death of their favorite characters\\, political correctness\\, peace and love. But what is unacceptable is to stitch these elements together in a disgusting way under a great game IP. In my opinion\\, Neil is sculpting a piece of art he thinks with his aesthetic\\, imposing his values \u200b\u200bon the player in the game. The bad plot design makes the player's emotional experience bad\\, which reminds me of the final season of Game of Thrones.\r\rAs for the emotional experience in the game\\, I think that The flashback of Ellie\u2019s memories in the game is not enough to change the player\u2019s emotions. When I manipulated Abby\\, I once tried to let her die in various ways\\, but it is frustrating that there is no way to change the plot\\, I must endure letting her live. Bad mood runs through my game time after Joel's death. As a sequel to TLOU\\, TLOU II has a huge split on the emotional logic of the previous work\\, which is disgusting.\r\rIn the pandemic\\, I hope to sell my TLOU II CD as soon as possible and forget it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
