Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Came into this movie with high expectations but went out utterly disappointed. The main plot is extremely thin\\, the jokes cliche and badly timed and the movie shoves some completely unnecessary sidestory instead of focusing on Snooker\\, Luke or literary anything more relevant. I really enjoyed the force bond dialogue between Rey and Kylo Ren but going forward the cartoonish way in which Nux was treated and lack of credibility of Kylo Ren as a villain will further drag the saga down. However\\, I believe that the most upsetting thing about TLJ is the treatment of Luke storyline and character. Honestly think this might be the worst movie in the series and seriously can't understand a 93% critic score.","true":true}
