Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe what I'm seeing.\\nTLJ is without a doubt one of the best movies in the Star Wars saga. As a huge Star Wars fan\\, I came to my country's premiere\\, when I left the movie theater I was sure that this movie will be loved by the community.\\n\\nThis movie is absolutely fantastic. Both plots were interesting and very enjoyable.\\n\\nTo those who are saying that they are disappointed of the truth about Rey's parents- This is exactly what I hoped and thought will happen. Making her the daughter\/cousin\/nephew of someone would be really\\, really Clich\u00e9.","true":true}
