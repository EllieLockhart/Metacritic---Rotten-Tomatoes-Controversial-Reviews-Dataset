Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars is dying - let's put it out of its misery\\n\\nFor over 20 years I've been a Star Wars fan. (movies\\, music and games)\\nI fear The Last Jedi will be my last Star Wars movie. \\nIt's totally clear now - Disney will destroy the franchise with its leftist SJW agenda.\\n\\n\\nMy view on the characters:\\n\\nSnoke the Joke: Nuff said\\nPoe: Oh oh... toxic masculinity\\, micro aggression\\, mansplaining!\\nKylo: Still a whiny emo brat\\nLeia: Dies and then Marry Poppins her way back to the ship? Seems legit.\\nRey: meh\\nLuke: Jerking off a sea cow. So sad.\\nChewie: Turns vegan\\nToken Asian Girl: check!\\nFinn: Was he in this movie? He certainly didn't do anything.\\nR2D2 \/ C3P0: useless\\nChrome Brienne of Tarth: useless\\n\\nPlot \/ story:\\n\\nCasino scene:\\nThis is where the movie killed me. I completely zoned out during this scene. What-the-hell-am-I-watching?\\n\\nRich white people are bad because they beat their kids\\, are cruel to animals and make money on arms dealing.\\nFuck you\\, Disney.\\n\\nKamikaze hyperjump:\\nCool idea. Should have been done by Admiral Ackbar\\, not Purple Hair Lady no one cares about.\\n\\nBattle on Not-Hoth planet:\\nI was getting excited seeing the setup\\, I thought this battle was going to resemble the famous Hoth battle. \\nA rebel soldier in the trenches takes a lick of the white substance covering the ground.\\n\\\"Salt\\\". Wut. A lackluster battle followed.\\n\\nEven if I leave out Disney's SJW bs I'm still left with a very weak movie.\\nPlot holes\\, cringe scenes\\, flat characters\\, dull story writing\\, badly placed \\\"humor\\\".\\n\\nDear Disney\\, please choke on your leftist SJW non-binary PC vegan soy lattes.","true":true}
