Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Destroys Luke's Story arc and character from the original trilogy. Unneeded casino subplot. Humor that doesn't land. \\\"The Holdo Manuever\\\" ruins all space conflict\\, past and future. Add in many plot holes and you get the last Jedi.","true":true}
