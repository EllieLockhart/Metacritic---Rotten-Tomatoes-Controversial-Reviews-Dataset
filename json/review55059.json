Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve never left a theater so sad in my life and I\u2019ve never been so sad about a movie the day after I\u2019ve seen it. I wanted it to get better but that feeling stopped once the credits began rolling. This movie has ruined the Star Wars legacy and I am no longer excited for upcoming Star Wars films. I thought it was really cheesy\\, the script was terrible\\, and the acting was bad. This movie was just made to sell merchandise and Disney had the balls to tarnish a legendary saga for $. So sad ","true":true}
