Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A fresh approach to what a Star Wars film can be. Enjoyed the overall messages presented in the film. The broken Luke Skywalker & the Rashomon style look at his failure was interesting. Really liked the connection between Kylo and Rey\\, especially with how it was presented.","true":true}
