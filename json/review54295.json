Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had a blast. There where some issues with pacing\\, and some of the dialogue was pretty hammy\\, but the action started from the start right to the finish\\, we got a good dose of some old faves\\, Luke\\, Leiah and Chewy\\, and learned a lot more about our new faves\\, Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, and the increasingly interesting Kylo Ren. Some fans might grumble as to how Rey got so good at what she does\\, well blow it out a hole\\, its all good fun and dont think it over too much. Star trek was always big dumb space adventure stuff\\, except when it wasn't. And when it wasnt it was the prequels and frankly not very star trek. This is a return to form\\, and I had a grand old time with it\\, despite its faults.","true":true}
