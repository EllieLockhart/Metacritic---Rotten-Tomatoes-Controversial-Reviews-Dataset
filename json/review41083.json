Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had everything I look for in a Star Wars movie. It had sacrifice\\, romance\\, and most importantly all the characters that bring Star Wars together  (excluding dead characters). This was just in all out blast of a movie and I would recommend it to long time fans and people just wanting to see a great movie.","true":true}
