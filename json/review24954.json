Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My initial reaction to this movie was abhorrence as a Star Wars fan: every original character was either killed or their persona changed in a way that doesn't fit with previous character arcs.  Admiral Akbar (fan favorite) nonchalantly killed off.  If you watch Episode 6 and then Episode 8\\, the change of Luke Skywalker's character makes no sense.  This is the only person who saw any light in Dark Vader in the whole galaxy\\, but somehow now he has given up hope on his nephew?  Ran away? Given up on the Rebellion?  Really?  Makes no sense.  I grew up dreaming of all the cool things Luke was going to do after Episode 6\\, well Ryan Johnson has killed all those dreams for me.\\n\\nBeyond just being an upset fan\\, there are huge numbers of plotholes and lazily directed scenes.  Leia coming back from outer space made no sense\\, and when they open the bridge door for her to come back inside\\, everyone should have been sucked out into space.  Apparently the director realized this\\, so he just cut scenes instead of explaining why opening a door into space didn't kill everyone.  Fynn dragging Rose 3 miles in 5 minutes across an open desert in front of AT AT walkers and not dying\\, makes no sense.  The whole casino scene was an undisguised political message that contributed nothing to the plot.  The purple haired general not telling Poe her plan which led to a mutiny\\, made no sense.  Using hyperdrive as a super weapon?  If that is so effective\\, why was that never done in a previous Star Wars?  How about running out of fuel?  Never heard of that before in Star Wars.  If the rebel ships are \\\"smaller and faster\\\" than the First Order ships\\, how come they always stay within range of the cannons?  For that matter\\, why doesn't the First Order just hyperspace jump in front of the Rebellion ships and cut them off?  Seriously\\, this is the laziest written huge budget film I've ever seen.\\n\\nJohnson also made sure to kill off the plot paths that JJ Abrams set up: Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, what has Luke been doing out in the galactic backwaters?  Well\\, all those are either unanswered or disappointing\\, not sure how Abrams will recover for Episode 9.\\n\\nOh\\, and if you want cute animals to sell toys in a Star Wars movie\\, at least make them add to the plot.  At least Ewoks did something\\, the Porgs were just there to make Disney execs get Christmas bonuses.","true":true}
