But what I care about is storytelling\\, characters and gameplay. And TLOU2 managed to fail in all of those categories. All good games\\, despite all differences\\, have common traits - they gave freedom of choice to the gamer and respect that choice. TLOU2 does exact opposite to this. Gamer is literally forced to play for characters he doesn't like\\, to follow the story which is not involving\\, to made choices he doesn't want\\, to share opinion which he doesn't share and so on. Moreover gamer is not even allowed by the developers to express dissatisfaction with this forced agenda. All opinions which are not complimentary to this game are blamed and humiliated without consideration. Meanwhile mass-media hype and ratings are ridiculous. Seriously - calling TLOU2 right after it came out not even the \\\"best game of the year\\\" but \\\"best game ever\\\" stinks. Even when The Witcher 3 came out in May 2015 very few dare to call it \\\"game of the year\\\" until other games published in 2015. Only time proved greatness of TW3. And to call something as boring and silly as TLOU2 \\\"the game of the year\\\" same yer when Cyberpunk is expected and probably sequel to the BOTW? How biased and out of touch with reality those \\\"critics\\\" should have been to make such statements? How their opinion can be trusted or even taken seriously? So in addition to forced unpleasant choices\\, dumb story\\, unlikable characters\\, short and boring gameplay TLOU2 through biased media reviews forces gamers to share developers opinion and political agenda. Buying this game is like buying slave master who'll turn you into obedient slave and will make you suffer. I suggest some gamers are prone to masochism but generally people wouldn't pay for their own enslaving and suffering. So if you are not masochist and not dreaming about sponsoring some rich and arrogant slave master don't buy TLOU2 and demand refund if you was tricked to buy it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
