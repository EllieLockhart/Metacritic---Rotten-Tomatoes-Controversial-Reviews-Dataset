Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even though first movie was a remake\\, at least it laid a decent foundation of new characters and backstories (Rey's heritage\\, Snoke's rise & Kylo's corruption\\, Knights of Ren\\, etc). Too bad this movie said \\\"no thanks\\\" and went it's own way. Instead we got Finn and Rose (a horrible character the likes of Jar Jar) riding wild space horses through a casino trying to find Benicio del Toro. \\n\\nLove Star Wars but was seriously disappointed. Any real critic that gave this a good score had to have been pressured by their boss or afraid to cross Disney).","true":true}
