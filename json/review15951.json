Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm absolutely baffled by the positive reviews that the critics have given this. Rian Johnson has spoilt what had the potential to a brilliant trilogy after the force awakens. The snoke death scene was utterly bizzare and Rian's interpretation of Luke Skywalker is an insult to true star wars fans . Worst Star Wars film ever made imo.","true":true}
