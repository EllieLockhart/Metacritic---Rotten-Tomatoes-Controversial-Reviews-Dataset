Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a big Star Wars fan throughout my childhood and thereafter\\, I found myself saying during the film \u201ccan this just end already?\u201d The plot and subplots were very marginal. The usage of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia were poorly executed\\, and I left disappointed.","true":true}
