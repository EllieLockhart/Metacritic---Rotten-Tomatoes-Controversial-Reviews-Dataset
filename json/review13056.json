Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know how they're giving this director a new Star Wars trilogy. Is was a disjointed mess\\, with only glimpses of good movie only to be dashed by horrible character choices. I'm a long time fan of this universe and Rian Johnson ruined the new trilogy and long time characters. Cinematography was the only real highlight.","true":true}
