Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How this has a 91% on RT is beyond me.  Honestly\\, how 46% of viewers thought this film was good is beyond me.  And this has a higher rating than Rogue One?!  I guess the prequels are no longer the worst SW movies lol","true":true}
