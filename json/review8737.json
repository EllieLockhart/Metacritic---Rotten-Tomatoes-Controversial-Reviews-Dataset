Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For all the reasons everyone else has explained\\, I'm disappointed in this movie.  I acally thought it was a good movie outside the Star Wars context\\, but it doesn't respect the history that came before it. You don't have to change the way the Force works to bring the storyline into the future.\\n\\nFor me\\, the most disappointing  part is the lack of long-term vision and character arcs.  That was my favorite part of the original six.","true":true}
