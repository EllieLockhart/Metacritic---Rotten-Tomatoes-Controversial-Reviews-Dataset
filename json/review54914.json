Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's just plain and simply terribly written. I had formed an opinion of Ruin Johnson after watching his most famous piece of work to date 2012's Looper. That opinion being that he has no original ideas in his storytelling. Decades ago when cars were not as sophisticated as they are today\\, crooked dealerships would create one new car by welding together two totalled cars and they were called cut'n'shuts. Ruin Johnson does this cut'n'shut technique with well known blockbusters. Taking the good stuff from Matrix\\, Terminator\\, Akira (manga) etc. And he distracts you with these selling points and the end result is you can remember what you thought going in to the movie but you sure don't remember the story arc of his film. All because he just cannot tell a good story! Soon as I heard they let him write his own story for Star Wars The Last Jedi I knew he was not up the the caliber of director such a movie deserves. This new generation of movie goers are satisfied with well done cgi and set pieces and the basic story telling is not of high importance. Star Wars just seriously deserved more than what  a rookie director writer like Ruin Johnson","true":true}
