Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Emotional it is\\, thrilling it surely is\\, story getting tiresome\\, looks like future instalments will be a reboot of Ep.4! Kudos to Mark Hamill's facial acting\\, Kylo Ren plays like a frustrated spoilt brat\\, Rey is tough as a pretty Sigourney\\, Porgs' sad looks bring to mind Puss in Boots\\, Poe & Leia passable\\, alien looking Snoke's ego got himself killed\\, still cannot see the importance of Finn's character which is once again superfluous and hopeless\\, all other character parts and performances are close to forgettable. VFX and sound marvellous.","true":true}
