Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Garbage. All the forced feminist stuff aside\\, I feel like what passes for a great movie nowadays has steadily gone downhill. I felt like the old star wars movies were movies where the most important underlying themes were heady things like good vs evil (light vs dark)\\, sith vs jedi (selfish motives vs unselfish motives)\\, and so much more. To me the biggest underlying theme is forced feminism and diversity. I say forced because it doesn't seem natural to me at all. To me it seems like they had an idea that they brutely forced into a script because they KNEW that no matter how bad it looks to someone objectively\\, the critics would go bananas over it.","true":true}
