Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't care for it simply because the low tier comedy broke the tension in every meaningful moment. Then any well structured moments weren't given enough time. I REALLY felt the Disney \\\"appeal to everyone and sell merch\\\" creed this time around. I liked the story and was surprised with how well cast the characters were\\, it just felt like a movie where it was finished\\, really well structured\\, but then Disney's board said \\\"we need way more easy jokes for the kids\\, and a sidekick to sell plushies.\\\"","true":true}
