Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just awful\\, and I don't think that because I'm not a \\\"true Star Wars fan\\\" this is coming from someone who bought every episode 3 LEGO set\\, has just about every Star Wars video game\\, and knows the answer to every Star Wars trivial pursuit question. It's an insult to the viewer and the franchise\\, watch it for FREE and be the judge yourself but don't pay for it or you'll only encourage more of this crap.","true":true}
