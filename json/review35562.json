Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a bit of divisive movie. Where The Force Awakens opted to borrow some elements from A New Hope\\, TLJ borrows very few elements from other Star Wars films. It's very different. There's a clear divide among the fanbase as to what they want going forward\\, but I personally enjoyed the movie very much. I'm interested to see the final installment of this trilogy\\, and where it takes our titular hero\\, and villain\\, from here.","true":true}
