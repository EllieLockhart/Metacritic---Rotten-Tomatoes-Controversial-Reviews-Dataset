Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not unwatchable\\, but is filled with all kinds of plot holes\\, and it fails to pay off on the mysteries set up by its immediate predecessor. But Star Wars is like Pizza\\, even when it's bad\\, it's still pretty good. Though this is pretty far removed from Empire(TM).","true":true}
