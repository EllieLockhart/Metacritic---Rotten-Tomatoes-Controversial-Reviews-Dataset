Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i thought The Last Jedi was very good and saw it twice.Was even better the second time.I disagree with the 'Popcorn \\\"fan reviews and I\\,m sure Yoda would agree. As Yoda would say.' A star Wars fab does not crave these 'Popcorn things' ' Predictability\\,hummph\\,Nostalgia\\,hummph.\\\"a Star Wars fan has the deepest commitment\\,the most serious following.You must see this movie twice\\,to complete your training\\,complete your training.","true":true}
