Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was dumb. Every new characer is boring and the whole plot devise of not being able to catch up to the rebel ships was stupid. The sory didn't make any sense. Its like they wanted this movie to be dumb. I don't understand how a movie could get this far along and nobody ask these questions about how absurd the story was?","true":true}
