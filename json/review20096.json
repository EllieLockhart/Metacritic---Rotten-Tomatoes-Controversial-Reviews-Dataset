Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was not as I expected and it didn't follow the normal formula which at first made me uncertain how i felt about this film.  However\\, after a second viewing I have watched it without expectations and found that I liked it more than I thought I did initially.","true":true}
