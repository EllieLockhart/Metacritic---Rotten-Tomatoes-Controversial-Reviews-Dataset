Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing\\, about an hour and a half of pointles story that adds not substance to the movie\\, very uncreative\\, bad acting\\, dumb lines\\, dumb comedy\\, ever since Guardians of the Galaxy almost every sci-fi film has been trying to mimic it's humor and fails horribly.  Ryan Johnson just killed the Star Wars.","true":true}
