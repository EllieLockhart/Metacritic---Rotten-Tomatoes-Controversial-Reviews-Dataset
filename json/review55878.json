Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed in this. This is the worst installment of the franchise. It is like the copied and pasted marvel one liners hoping to just copy and paste another success. The writing was poor\\, and while some of the actors did an excellent job\\, they were over shadowed by piss poor plot development. Almost nothing was added to the galaxy or arch of the story other than dumb characters like Rose. The Jedi were weak and unimaginative. They over CGI everything. Storm troopers are not more than just props. The grittiness that Rian Johnson did so well with in the Breaking Bad series is completely abscent from this movie. Almost anything that a fan looked forward to in this movie was not there. It is like they resurrected the soul of Jar Jar Binks and let him write this movie.","true":true}
