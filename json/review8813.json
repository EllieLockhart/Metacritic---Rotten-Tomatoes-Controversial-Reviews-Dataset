{"101487":121769,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For many\\, the Star Wars franchise isn't just a series of movies-it's an experience; nostalgia\\, drama\\, humor and heartbreak on display for all the galaxy to see. It's a melting pot that evokes themes of religion\\, diversity\\, military\\, romance and betrayal. And if nothing else\\, a clash of swords on the precipice of defeat-or hope.\\n\\nTwo years removed from our last (numbered) episode\\, expectations have become lofty and imposing. The monumental success of The Force Awakens\\, as well as the heavily praised Rogue One\\, have set the stage for The Last Jedi to continue the franchise's momentum. Mild spoilers for the Episode VII: The Force Awakens lie ahead\\, so be sure to tread carefully.\\n\\nThe story picks up immediately where VII left off\\, with the members of our main group on their individual paths to discovery. Rey comes upon a desolate island at which\\, the now hermit\\, Luke Skywalker resides. Her journey brings her to a crossroads where she hopes to discover the true essence of the Force\\, as well as a means to deal with the ever looming First Order. Meanwhile\\, the rebellion finds themselves in constant peril\\, and on the run. In opposition\\, the villainous Kylo Ren is haunted by his deeds in VII\\, and is ridiculed for his failures and shortcomings.\\n\\nI'm not one for stringing things along\\, or beating around the bush\\, so I'll jump right into the crux of the review. The Last Jedi\\, as a whole\\, is a disjointed\\, disproportionate mess of filmmaking. It's inconsistencies are the only constant\\, and most all prior character development has been twisted and rung out-leaving viewers with only shells of their former idols. Moments of drama are hamstrung by comedic priority; a juvenile sense of comedy\\, at that. The film also lacks focus\\, often choosing to sell viewers on quirky wildlife and shoddy CGI\\, rather than the iconic characters that the franchise has been known for. \\n\\nMain critiques of The Force Awakens mostly consisted of J.J. Abrams's lack of risk\\, but in turn\\, that allowed for him to craft a very refined\\, and modern re-introduction to the galaxy far\\, far away. One could\\, in theory\\, praise director Rian Johnson's risk-taking antics\\, but one doesn't garner praise from solely taking risks-moreso it's the result of said risks that determine that. Star Wars isn't exactly known for its subtleties\\, but it does find moments where it inserts extra layers of depth to its very digestible surface-level storyline. (See Chirrut \u00cemwe's usage of the Force in Rogue One as an example.) The Last Jedi often chooses to ignore any semblance of deeper meaning\\, and ride the coattails of obligatory humor and cheeky one-liners.\\n\\nHowever\\, if ever there was a silver lining to the series as a whole\\, it still remains true here-as John Williams once again embodies the essence of Star Wars in every momentous\\, moving piece of music. Even in the most cringe-worthy of unnecessary scenes\\, the foundation that almost makes it watchable continues to be the perfected themes and melodies that back them. In the visuals department\\, it is quite the opposite. For every blood-red piece of rock that kicks up as our pilots hover close to the ground\\, there is an equal and opposite critter than needs to be zoomed in on or addressed. Space battles and dogfights range from tense and action-packed to slow\\, and downright boring. A particular action sequence in the middle will no doubt incite a roar of cheers in surprise\\, but once the excitement subsides\\, it ends up feeling disingenuous-as nothing about The Last Jedi feels earned.\\n\\nAnd that brings me to my biggest critique: Nothing feels earned. Amidst the parade of sweeping declarations\\, a dazzling array of explosives on the biggest of battlefields\\, Star Wars\\, if anything\\, has conditioned us to indulge most in the climactic set pieces-specifically in the ways they conclude. Think of Obi-Wan letting go\\, and accepting his fate at the hands of Darth Vader\\, or Luke finding out the truth of his origins\\, or Leia passing off the plans of the Death Star off to the rebels. The moments not only act as a turning point for the story ark\\, but epitomize key aspects of the characters themselves. The Last Jedi feels moreso like decision making on a whim. Characters come and go\\, but without proper care and build-up\\, nothing ends up resonating when they meet an untimely end.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi has an erratic knack for style\\, and misses the mark completely when it comes to eliciting powerful\\, heartfelt emotions. It's difficult to recommend seeing the film in really any capacity\\, given that if you enjoyed Episode VII\\, VIII will impair your desire to continue with the trilogy. No\\, it isn't the worst of the nine\\, but with a franchise that consists of films that are either fiery hot or ice cold\\, being somewhere in the middle isn't cause for celebration. It's unfortunate.","true":true}
