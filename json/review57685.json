Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Turbo lasers that arc in space\\, bombs that need to be dropped like a B17\\, Leia Poppins\\, Asshat Luke\\, Ray's parents!?\\, still no Snoak backstory or reveal...and too many jokes. Not a real Star Wars movie even if it was set in that universe. I'm a huge Star Wars fan but I won't be seeing the next movie because this one sucks so much.","true":true}
