Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a terrible mess. Aside from a complete lack of understanding for the characters of the original trilogy\\, the story has far too many characters who spend massive amounts of time a meaningless tangents only to return to exactly where they started with nothing of any significance having happened.  In most cases had the characters done nothing or never existed at all the story wouldn't have changed at all.  The primary example is Finn and Rose's entire story line.  Ultimately they end up right back where they started 2 hrs later with the exact same result as if they had just stayed put and done nothing.   The movie also completely ignores any and all story lines from episode 7 or simply tosses them away nonchalantly so it can arbitrarily tell whatever story it wants.  The story like the last one also seems to just completely ignore or be only very high level aware of what happened in the original three films.","true":true}
