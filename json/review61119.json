However\\, in my pathetic 19 years on earth\\, I have never had any form of entertainment medium make me ball my eyes out like how this game has done for me. And I mean that in a good way. There were so many instances where I just couldn't handle the emotional baggage TLOU2 would throw at me\\, and it baffles me that a **** videogame can make me and many others feel this way. The amount of stress I would have during encounters and scavenging was incredible\\, and it only made the gameplay more surreal with its polished mechanics further enhancing. It is by far\\, the most impressive thing gaming has been able to do. The team at Naughty Dog has not only set a far higher standard for themselves and other cinematic games but the entertainment industry as a whole.

If this game were to of given me choices throughout the game that would change the storyline whether subtle or drastic\\, I honestly would have put my controller down and walked away. Having that feeling of helplessness in a narrative like this fits perfectly. I had pacing problems with some parts\\, but after giving myself time to reflect on the outcome I can say that this is easily the most engaging piece of art I have experienced.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
