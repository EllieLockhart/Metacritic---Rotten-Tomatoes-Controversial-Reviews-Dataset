Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ has a major antagonist problem\\, in that they're all\\,at best\\, forgettable and uninspired.  Lots of plot holes and arbitrary plot devices that are not consistent within the Star Wars universe.  Too many \\\"Guardians of the Galaxy\\\"\/Marvel style slapstick jokes.  Rey is still egregiously and inexplicably overpowered (a \\\"Mary Sue\\\") with little character development.  The few loose plot threads that JJ Abrams left from the previous film were completely ignored or under-utilized.  I love every Star Wars film\\, even the prequels\\, but I honestly hated TLJ.  Will be making a YouTube video about this explaining everything I didn't like about it.","true":true}
