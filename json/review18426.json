Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a visually striking movie but that doesn\u2019t save it. TLJ Luke is not original trilogy Luke. Horribly wasted character in TLJ. The new main characters minus Kylo and Rey\\, who seems to be the only useful and likable one\\, are reckless and dangerous. They make Jar Jar Binks look competent. At least in his buffoonery he was able to take out some droids. The story is messy and often nonsensical\\, rehashing scenes from previous movies. TLJ was so disappointing that it made me\\, a Star Wars fan\\, lose interest in Star Wars.","true":true}
