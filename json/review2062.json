Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A Star Wars movie for the modern era.  Packed full of action\\, light saber duels\\, plot twists and a fantastic performance from Mark Hamill..  It expands upon what we know of The Force in a way necessary to move the franchise forward\\, otherwise we would just be stuck with rehashing past movies in subtle remakes such as The Force Awakens.  I can't wait to see where JJ Abrams takes us in Episode  9.  I loved the new character Rose\\, my only negative comment about this movie is that I thought her plot line was a little thin and hope to see her character better developed in the next installment.   Empire Strikes Back will forever be my favorite Star Wars movie\\, mostly because it reminds me of when I was was younger\\, but this is my new favorite #2.","true":true}
