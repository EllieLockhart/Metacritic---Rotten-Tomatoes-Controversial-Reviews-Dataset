Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The deliberate dismissal of the core themes that surround and underly Star Wars caused this film to crumble. From the heroic sacrifices to the galactic car chases\\, the action did not disguise the poor execution of the Skywalker story.","true":true}
