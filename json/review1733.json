Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a stand alone movie its mediocre. As a Star Wars movie its not only terrible but it retroactively ruins the original trilogy.\\nThe whole plot involving finn is pointless\\, thats at least an hour of the movie. The fleet admiral had no reason to not tell Poe the escape plan\\, but still she didnt and indirectly killed half the rebels for that pointless decision. Also now you can use your ship as a bettering ram to destroy the enemy fleet\\, one has to wonder why the captain of the medical cruiser didnt do that  and saved us from 2 hours of a stupid movie.\\nLuke character was destroyed\\, he is now a coward that didnt want to help anyone but for some reason he left a map in order to be found in case the galaxy needed him. Snoke was a pointless character and there is no mystery around him\\, he was just a bad guy. I could go on for hours.","true":true}
