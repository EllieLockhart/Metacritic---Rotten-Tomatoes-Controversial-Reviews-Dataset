Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst Star Wars movie yet to be made. The bad guys are introduced as a joke\\, acting like complete morons\\, reminiscent of villains in Disney movies made for 12 year olds. The quippy\\, marvel-like comedy throughout the movie is so out of place it hurts to watch. After all of the build up for phasma and snoke in TFA\\, they are unceremoniously scrubbed away with not even a peak into their backstory nor before they could impact the story itself. An entire act dedicated to a casino (which btw looked nothing like a Star Wars setting) could have been excluded\\, and Finn's character is now nothing but a hopeless romantic with 0 impact on events; I had hope that he would have some impact on the story towards the end but I forced romance prevented him from completing his character ark\\, a forced romance with a chubby engineer who seems plucked straight out of The Big Bang Theory. It's horrendous. Leia survives an explosion on the bridge of a ship\\, flys through space using the force\\, defrosts herself and lives on. One X-wing destroys all the turbo lasers on an entire capital ship\\, only to have a \\\"ww2 style\\\" bomber ship \\\"drop\\\" bombs through space onto said ship. Luke and Yodas characters\\, full of wisdom and passion for the Jedi become weak minded fools willing to desecrate and burn everything the jedi stood for and came from. Yoda summons a lighting bolt as his ghost form. Prepare for plenty of cutesy disney creatures as well\\, there is a whole sequence of giant effing llamas with pointy ears running through a big bad casino and rich town\\, getting good old classic disney justice! There are so many other problems with this movie I could write an essay about it. They got a few things right with the direction of the story\\, but this was a horribly written and paced film that does not deserve to be in a glaxy far\\, far away.","true":true}
