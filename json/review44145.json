Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To call this a bad movie would be charitable as it does not even merit the term \\\"movie.\\\" Suicide Squad was a bad movie. This wasn't even a movie. It was an incoherent mess. The actors did a good job but they had nothing to work with.","true":true}
