Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cheap laughs\\, plot holes\\, bad...no terrible acting\\, and the affect of trying to cram way too much story and action into a legacy means a  poor movie destined to make a lot of money. Box office draws equate to an expectation not necessarily a blockbuster Star Wars storyline.","true":true}
