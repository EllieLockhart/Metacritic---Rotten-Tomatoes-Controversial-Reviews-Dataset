Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was far better than Episode 7\\, though that is a low bar to hurtle\\, The Last Jedi does so gracefully.\\n\\nNew character archetypes\\, and character failures bring a refreshing realism to this world. \\\"Fewer\\\" Deus Ex plot points\\, and failed missions bring a truer sense of war. Allying enemies break down stereotypes and ideological barriers for brief moments\\, revealing differing \\\"points of views\\\" (though this should have been done to more effect).\\n\\nI'm glad to see The Last Jedi not commit as many sins as The Force Awakens\\, but it does not fulfill on the promises & mystery The Force Awakens sowed. I blame that on The Force Awakens more than The Last Jedi. \\n\\nThis movie does a great job of setting up the possibility of a unique and interesting sequel.\\n\\nPros: \\nCharacters drive this story.\\nHeroes don't always win because they want to. \\nChoices have consequences. \\n\\nCons:\\nCharacters don't change.\\nUnexpected things happen for gags. \\nSome of the humor was jarring and made me feel like I was watching a marvel movie. Too much wink and nod to the audience. The typical cheap\/quick joke to make you laugh the first time\\, and sigh the second time. Jokes that undercut the dire situations\\, and over acted impressions of Hitler.\\nPoor character decisions that could easily be cleared up by having real human conversations.","true":true}
