{"101487":181590,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a fantastic film. A fantastic film\\, that is\\, unless you're a Star Wars fan like me.\\n\\nI didn't totally hate this movie. There were many moments that I appreciated\\, that I loved. The sequence on Crait involving Luke\\, for example\\, was thrilling for the first two minutes\\, before he reveals he was simply a projection\\, and died. The fuck\\, movie? Also\\, The Porgs were cute and cuddly\\, and would have been a great addition to this movie\\, like the Ewoks of \\\"Return of the Jedi.\\\"\\n\\nHowever\\, there were more elements I didn't like than elements I did like. For example\\, the telepathic communication between Rey and Kylo seemed dorky. While it does add an interesting piece in the lore of the Jedi and the Force\\, there was too much humor in those particular instances\\, and were used far too often. From a cinematic standpoint\\, the fact that the characters could see each other was dumb\\, but I guess that in terms of the lore\\, it is what it is.\\n\\nThe opening battle was wonderful\\, although was not fulfilled in terms of plot. The bombers flying toward the dreadnought escorted by fighters was reminiscent of any movie or story about World War II bombing runs\\, which Lucas alluded to in his original films. Nice job. I didn't like how easily the dreadnought was brought down\\, and how Leia reacted to Poe's insubordinate actions. \\n\\nLater\\, when Leia is blasted out into space\\, she used the Force to guide herself back to the door\\, where she is brought inside the ship and escorted to a hospital wing or something. I don't really understand how she was able to use the Force like she did\\, but I didn't like it.\\n\\nNext\\, we cut to Luke and Rey\\, and endure a long and an ANNOYING AS FUCKING HELL sequence in which Rey follows Luke around the island during his daily routine. Throughout this entire movie\\, Luke isn't himself. Although I'm throwing Rian Johnson a lot of shade\\, I think he did this for a reason that isn't revealed in this film. When Luke tells Rey about why Kylo went rogue\\, he describes himself going to kill Ben Solo\\, which is completely out of character.\\n\\nNow\\, the GODDAMN SUBPLOTS!!! SO much of \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" was devoted to creating mystery around the new characters to which we were introduced. Who are Rey's parents? Who is Snoke? Why did Luke leave? What the fuck\\, movie? Rey's parents are no one\\, Snoke fucking DIED in the most BITCH WAS POSSIBLE\\, and Luke left because he didn't want to be found\\, despite leaving a FUCKING MAP FOR PEOPLE TO FIND HIM!!! The fuck\\, Luke- er\\, I mean\\, the fuck\\, movie? Keep your shit straight. J. J. Abrams set up a phenomenal intro to this promising new trilogy\\, but I'm afraid that Rian Johnson has gone and trashed all of it. I really do hope that he's hiding something from us for Abrams to reveal in Episode IX. If so\\, I apologize\\, Rian\\, I do.\\n\\nNext\\, I wanna rant about the plot. Ok\\, so some of Resistance (Rebel?) ships are running from the First Order fleet\\, which is just out of range to send a full-on attack with TIE Fighters. Poe\\, Rose\\, and Finn team up to disable the enemy ship's tracker and escape. However\\, following Leia's incident\\, a new leader takes over (I'll call her Purple for now)\\, and maintains the curren tactic course of running","true":true}
