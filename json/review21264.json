Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into this film wanting something new from the saga and I got it. As a true star wars fan I loved the film\\, I was not predictable and threw out some interesting questions. There were a couple of things I didn't particularly like but as a whole it was amazing.","true":true}
