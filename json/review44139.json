Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To be honest. The Force Awakens was a blow out as far as story and cinematography. The Last Jedi was visually astonishing but falls back into what made episodes 1-3 so bad. There wasn't any thing great other than seeing our favorite characters together again.","true":true}
