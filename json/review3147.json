Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically an extended version of the Battle of Hoth (The Empire Strikes Back) in which its plot was evidently based on too\\, lacked content that was relevant to the story and contained irrelevant characters and sub-plots","true":true}
