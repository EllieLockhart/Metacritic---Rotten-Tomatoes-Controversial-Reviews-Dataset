Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it\\, story\/plot wise this is nothing like previous the Star Wars films except that it\u2019s visual designs and effects pay homage to the original three films. Only fanboys are upset that the latest movie isn\u2019t another iteration of the same old story. ","true":true}
