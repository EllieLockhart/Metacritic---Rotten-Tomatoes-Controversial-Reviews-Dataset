Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have seen the episodes 4-6 you have seen episode 7-8. It is basically the same story with different actors. And Kylo Ren is the worlds worst villain. I have been calling him Darth Bieber he is so bad. The humor was misplaced\\, Luke was a self absorbed whiny child and who the heck is Rose? This is one of the worst movies in the series.","true":true}
