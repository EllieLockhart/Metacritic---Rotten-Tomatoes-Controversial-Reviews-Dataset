Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an epic disappointment. Rian Johnson took a giant\\, galactic dump on the Star Wars franchise. I'm still deciding if I loathe this movie more or less than the prequels. I was completely shocked at how bad the movie was. I saw the critic reviews and thought that there is no way that I will hate this movie. I was totally wrong. It was far worse than than anything I imagined. The worst part is\\, they totally ruined Luke's character. Aside from that  atrocity\\, the story was bad\\, the dialogue was bad\\, the special effects were bad (the overuse of cartoony CGI made a triumphant return)\\, the overuse of campy comic relief was bad\\, the new characters were bad\\, the old characters were poorly used\\, and aside from Rey and Luke\\, the acting was pretty weak. \\n\\nI almost felt like Rian Johnson was mocking the Star Wars universe and goofing on its fans. And I spent the last 18 years goofing on fans of the prequels. Maybe Rian was a major prequel fan and he was getting his revenge on guys like me.\\n\\nThe damage has been done. Unless J.J. starts off then next movie with Luke waking up from a lame-ass dream\\, I'm not sure what he can do with this mess.","true":true}
