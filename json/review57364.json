Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie makes The Force Awakens pointless. I do like that they didn't try to copy any of the old movies\\, but to me this was a big middle finger to The Force Awakens. Character development didn't happen. Everyone is in the exact same place as they were in the last one. Overall very boring plot with useless parts and characters. You could literally cut entire subplots out and the movie would be the same. Great visuals\\, but not enough to distract me from the terrible humor. So many directions that this movie could have gone and been good\\, but instead decided that even the tile of the film won't be true by the end of it. Is false marketing a thing?","true":true}
