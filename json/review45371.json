Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter travesty. Boring\\, one-dimensional characters and incoherent and incompetently-written and paced plot. Gratuitous left-wing political messages are laid on with a trowel throughout in a way that lacks any subtlety\\, but even overlooking this it is long\\, slow and directionless. Wooden portrayals of Rey and Ren\\, whereas Hamil and Fisher can act\\, they were undermined by the terrible script.\\nIt would surprise me if the director even bothered to watch any of the other films; this is certainly no sequel.\\nI couldn't care less what happened to any of the main characters by the end; they were all so annoying and unconvincing.\\n\\nI was disappointed that The Force Awakens just felt like a re-hash\\, but it was a masterpiece compared to this drivel.
