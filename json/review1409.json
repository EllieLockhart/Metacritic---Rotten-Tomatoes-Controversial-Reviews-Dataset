{"101487":104952,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a diehard fan\\, who saw The Last Jedi at the Hollywood premiere\\, I've been left feeling confused. Part of me is very much in love with this movie\\, and part of me is ridiculously disappointed. Before I begin delving into the reasons why\\, I'd like to make note that I have really enjoyed the last two Star Wars films (The Force Awakens and Rogue One\\, especially Rogue One which is in my opinion\\, the second or third best Star Wars of all time). I also really dislike the sequels and they will forever be in my bottom three of the rankings.                                    \\n\\nWith that being said\\, The Last Jedi does many things very well\\, but that success is  corrupted by a few horrific decisions and (gut-wrenchingly) terrible writing. The movie succeeds in special effects obviously\\, but the new exploration of Kylo Ren and Rey was done extremely well. Both characters\\, most notably Kylo\\, go through a satisfying amount of character development. Adam Driver portrays the character to near perfection with a very convincing performance battling his inner turmoil between the dark and light. Rey receives much less character development\\, but we gain some insight into her vulnerability and her connections with Kylo add a very intriguing presence to the film.\\nThe story itself is very good and mirrors the standard mid-film darkness of any trilogy. The Resistance literally becomes obliterated. Mark Hamill is the shining star of the film\\, with an absolutely tremendous performance. He has a commanding presence onscreen and he should receive accolades and awards for his performance. However...the direction they take on the character is shameful. I understand why Mark didn't like the direction of the character. \\n\\nWhich leads into the negatives of the film\\, which far outweigh the positives. There are a few questionable scenes that ruin the movie. The Leia flying through space after being blown up is absolutely ridiculous. I understand the fanfare and it's implementation in honor of Carrie\\, but it simply doesn't work. And the ending of the movie is literally a reference to the Disney cartoon\\, The Sorcerors Apprentice (Really...an apprentice boy with a magic broom watching Tinkerbell fly away in the night sky...er I mean Spaceship). It was soul crushing. \\nThere were a few other parts that should have been removed (the animal captivity release at the casino\\, Rose kissing Finn to name a few) but the super Leia and Sorcerors Apprentice ending were simply intolerable.\\n\\nThe writing in this movie was one of the weakest parts of the entire film. They actually used \\\"good guys\\\"\\, \\\"bad guys\\\"\\, and \\\"Godspeed\\\" and used urban slang words like \\\"gonna\\\". The scene with Hux and Poe where they talk about \\\"being on hold\\\" made me throw up some of my popcorn\\, which actually tasted better than the bad taste the movie left in my mouth.  The writing was out of place and it removed the illusion. \\n\\nThe movie also continued to push a political agenda and did everything it could to emasculate the males in the movie. The majority of the men in the movie were portrayed as weak\\, brooding\\, volatile imbeciles\\, or just plain old bumbling idiots (Hux). There was not a strong male in this movie that didn't come with substantial flaws: unlike the women who were portrayed as intelligent\\, compassionate and wise. They even emasculated Chewbacca with the whole \\\"don't eat meat\\\" scene (which was actually surprisingly extremely funny).  The entire Casino scene reeked of liberal agenda labeling corporate wealth as evil and likened the wealthy to nothing more than cruel animal torturers. The entire Casino planet could have been removed from the film. \\n\\nIt's also becoming frustrating to see that it takes approximately five minutes to become a powerful Jedi. Rey receives little to no training but is suddenly a bad ass\\, even going so far as to almost defeating Luke in a duel. Her ability to move a mountain of rocks with no training is ridiculous\\, when Luke couldn't even move an x-wing under the guidance of Yoda. Maybe her true heritage has yet to be revealed\\, but she is ridiculously strong with The Force for such an untrained neophyte. \\n\\nAll in all\\, the movie left a bad taste in my mouth that felt similar to when I first saw the prequels. It's not even remotely as terrible as those movies\\, but it is definitely my least favorite of the new Star Wars movies. If Disney is so happy with Rian Johnson and the direction that he taking Star Wars\\, then I truly fear for the future of my favorite franchise. I have slowly come to the realization that the Star Wars that I know and love; the Star Wars that I grew up with and that has been a dominant force in my life no longer exists. And that couldn't be more obvious than when Kylo says \\\"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to\\\". Well...that's exactly what Disney is doing.","true":true}
