Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall\\, a disappointing movie! Style over substance. Star Wars is based in fantasy and this movie takes you away from that. I really wanted to like this movie. Just like many of the women and men reviewing it on YouTube\\, I too dislike the humor and especially the story line for Luke. I really don't want to see the next movie now\\, I have lost all interest.","true":true}
