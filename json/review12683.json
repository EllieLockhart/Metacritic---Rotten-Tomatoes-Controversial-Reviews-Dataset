Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I could have missed and not missed it.  Enough with the cute little animals and what was with Luke milking the four breasted dinosaur looking things and spear fishing with a 100 yard pole?  I can see the rolling dialog at the beginning of the next movie:   In an all inclusive diverse galaxy far far away...  I will be renting future Star War movies.","true":true}
