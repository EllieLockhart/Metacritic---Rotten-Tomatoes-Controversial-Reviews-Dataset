Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first half of this movie gives an extreme sense of deja vu. Because it's \\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\\" back poorly made. Rey's just as poorly written as last time\\, but now she's even more powerful\\, with the ability to do a training sequence that makes you question if they had anyone on set who knew anything about fighting and a fight sequence where she proves to be a better fighter\\, despite her lack of training\\, than any jedi master. Also Leia survives the vacuum of space somehow\\, but they don't bother explaining that. Speaking of poorly written characters\\, Finn is just as inconsistent as ever\\, going right from wanting to run away from the fight to joining a suicide mission.","true":true}
