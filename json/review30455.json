Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Severely overrated. The franchise is far more interested in making every character super witty and whimsical then having decent writing and filling plot wholes. Forced tropes and nostalgia sells and this movie hedges a lot of its bets on that idea. Don't see this movie within the first 2 weeks of release\\, its not that worthwhile.","true":true}
