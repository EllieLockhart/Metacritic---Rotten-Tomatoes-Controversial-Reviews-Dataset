Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely hated this Rian Johnson's \/ Disney movie... For many reasons such as too many political subplots for Sci-Fi movie\\, gapping plot holes from a storyline standpoint and too many dropped story lines from both the original series and Force Awakens to be considered as part of the saga. But the most unforgiveable reason to hate this movie should be for what they did with Luke Skywalker as a character and childhood idol. For those that are not 'into' Sci-Fi movies; it's as if they made a Rocky movie where Rocky just gives up at the first sign of adversity and rolled credits. That would not be my Rocky movie and this was not my Star Wars movie.","true":true}
