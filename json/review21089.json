Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so disappointed with this film. So many plot points from The Force Awakens were shoved aside. The visuals are spectacular\\, but the story was fractured and crawled along at over 2 and a half hours long. The Rose and Finn story line was very misplaced. I don't mind that their mission ended up being a failure but did not need to take up that much screen time. The messages in those scenes were misplaced in the narrative. \\n\\nLuke's character was completely assassinated. Luke Skywalker even considering to kill his apprentice (not to mention his nephew\\, Leia's son) was absolutely an atrocious idea. What a disappointing end for such an iconic hero.","true":true}
