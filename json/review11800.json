Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How many times must I suspend disbelief?!?  How many negative male stereotypes must I endure?  This is an ok movie that could have been great with a bit more thought put into the script.","true":true}
