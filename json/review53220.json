Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Biggest plot holes. No depth or explation to Snoke or Luke disappearance. Since when was space fuel ever needed in any aspect of the Star Wars universe? The love interest plot with Rose & Finn served zero purpose. No to mention their adventure to Casino Island. We're suppose to believe a liar\\, Kylo\\, that his word saying Rey's parents were nobodies and that's it\\, that her storyline about her is done?? The Dark Side part of the island that Rey visits to see a reflection of herself... zero explanation to that... \\nFinn drags injured Rose 2 miles by himself right after they crashed in front of 8 AT-ATs?! Vice Admiral goes Light speed through the ship that Rose & Finn were on while in a hanger FILLED with storm troopes. Yet\\, they are unharmed and all the bodies are missing? LOL\\n\\nOnly good parts were between Rey & Kylo. Also Mark Hamill's performance!","true":true}
