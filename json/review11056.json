Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Here's my ranking list for Star Wars films:\\n\t1.\tEmpire Strikes Back (1980)\\n\t2.\tA New Hope (1977)\\n\t3.\tRogue One  (2016)\\n\t4.\tLast Jedi (2017)\\n\t5.\tForce Awakens (2015)\\n\t6.\tReturn of the Jedi  (1983)\\n\t7.\tprequels - mostly crap","true":true}
