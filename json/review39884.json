Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a worthy sequel to the Star Wars universe.  It opens up an unlimited amount of possibilities for the future installments. It is fun\\, it takes the characters into unexpected paths and has some of the coolest scenes in a long time.","true":true}
