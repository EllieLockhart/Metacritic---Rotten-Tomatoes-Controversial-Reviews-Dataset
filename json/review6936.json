Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily a solid 9\/10. For me this movie almost touches The Empire Strikes Back levels of quality if you are still on the fence about this movie you owe it to yourself to go and see this epic movie and make your own mind up\\, don't just hop on the latest reviewer hate bandwagon. Yes it does have its flaws and odd moments but at the end of it you are left with a genuinely entertaining thrill ride of a movie. Rian Johnson was given the job of expanding these characters and their stories while giving us a good movie he has absolutely succeeded\\, I am bitterly disappointing he isn't returning for Episode 9.","true":true}
