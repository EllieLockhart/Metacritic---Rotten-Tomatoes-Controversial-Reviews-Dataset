Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It wasn't the best Star Wars movie but it had good action scenes . The movie was a good sequel to the rest of the movies in the series. The movie had good actors in it as well. The lines were well said . It was a long movie only that is what helps tell the story.","true":true}
