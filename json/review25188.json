Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"New title \u201cthe worst Jedi\u201d way too many stories going on. Not entertaining\\, not creative and we have seen this all before how many lives does Flnn have horrible movie how many near death scenes\\, and now Luke gone\\, too much Disney in this movie the jokes the bird with Chewbacca I mean come on up down all around this movie went critics and Disney hmm hmm\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14","true":true}
