Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where do I even start with how bad it was without giving the movie away?!?! It was so disappointing! There were so many scenes in that movie that didn't have anything to help the story and was completely meaningless.  I felt like this director didn't even watch the force awakens. I walked out of the theater asking myself what did I just watch? There was some good fight scenes\\, but those were few and far between. Overall it was awful!!! ????????????","true":true}
