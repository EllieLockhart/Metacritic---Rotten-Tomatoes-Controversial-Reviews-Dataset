Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So\\, most of the reviewers here seem to be giving us excellent impressions of Veruca Salt from Willy Wonka \\\"But I want an Oompa Loompa NOW!\\\"  Seriously\\, Rey wasn't who you wanted to her to be so you give the movie one star? Snoke didn't get an origin story\\, so it's not Star Wars?  What is wrong with you people? \\n\\nSPOILERS AHEAD\\n\\nThe saber fight with Rey and Kylo vs the guards was spectacular\\, especially with them facing of afterwards.  Did Luke seem bitter and depressed? Yes. He'd been through a lot. But watch the movie again. He used the light side in the most powerful display ever in a SW movie\\, gave his life and restored his character in the end.  Burning the books? Movies telling us don't be so hung up on the past that you fail to live in the present.  There are deep themes and heavy messages in this movie.  Rey's lack of lineage takes us back to the best thing about Star Wars\\, something lost with the whole midiclorian nonsense. Anybody can be great\\, anyone can make a difference. You don't need magic bugs in your cells\\, and you don't need to be a Skywalker to be powerful. \\n\\nIs it flawless? No. But the character arcs were satisfying\\, and I will gladly rank this movie higher than any of the prequel nonsense and better than R1\\, tho nothing tops the OT for me.","true":true}
