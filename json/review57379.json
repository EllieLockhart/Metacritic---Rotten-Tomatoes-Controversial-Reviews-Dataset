Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruins Star Wars.  It destroys any interesting backstory for any of the new characters\\, while also ruining Luke Skywalker.  Unfortunately\\, it has to be seen to understand how terrible it is and understand how terrible the film maker is to people who care about the original story. \\n\\nMinor stupid issues: bombs dropping in space; first time anyone thought to kamikaze at light speed; a slow\\, OJ Simpson Bronco-esk chase in space; Kylo being horrible at fighting and struggles against red storm troopers; Snoke doesn't know about tracking technology\\, yet can read minds across the galaxy\\, etc.\\n\\nBig Problems: \\n\\nRey - No backstory or connection to any original characters; \\nFinn - having no backstory and still not explaining how he went from janitor\\, now in space and on base\\, to stormtrooper; \\nSnoke - getting killed without seeing that happening although being able to connect minds across the universe; not giving Snoke any backstory e.g. where he was during original trilogy and prequels?; is he related to emperor?; where does he come from?; \\nLuke Skywalker - being a whiny bitch who just decides to Force vanish into death --- so dumb.","true":true}
