Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. Nothing great. Ten different plots going on that never really get any real development. Finn and his odd little romance thing that seemed highly out of place\\, to *SPOLIER ALERT* Snokes awful death and lack of explanation \/ back story. Meh.","true":true}
