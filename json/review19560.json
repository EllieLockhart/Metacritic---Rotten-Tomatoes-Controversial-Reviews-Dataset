Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It takes a lot of swings for the fences and absolutely whiffs on a lot however hits enough homeruns to balance out any missteps. It's refreshing to watch a movie not afraid to fail. For once I felt like I was watching a franchise movie by an author rather than a committee too scared to take any risks. This movie doesn't aim to be vanilla.","true":true}
