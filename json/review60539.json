Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I have played the first The last of Us on PS3 and I wanted to replay it on PS4 before Playing Part 2\\, I loved the first TLOU and the DLC left behind is a short but meaningful story\\, I finished my second playthrough of the first game the day before i started playing part 2 and I was glad I did that.

Part 2 is exactly that\\, a continuation of the first game but it has better but familiar gameplay and you feel at home with controls. Many dialogues can be missed if you haven't played the first like when Ellie tells that they once met a guy called Bill who used to plant bombs all over his town or when she was captured by people who used to eat their victims. Great acting and the story isn't obvious\\, never felt to know how it would go on. The game makes you feel many emotions and makes you even stop playing it because you don't want carry on\\, you don't agree with what is happening but this is the beauty of this game\\, within hours or minutes it makes you feel opposite emotions and makes you hate yourself for hating certain characters only because you didn't agree with them because of the lack of understanding and knowledge of their background and motivations. I loved the story but what I loved most was that this game brought up so many emotions\\, not all positives but also negatives\\, that i can't say many games are able to do so. Part 2 goes deeper in the story and gets better gameplay to the point that the first TLOU looks like a demo\\, just a taste of what ND wanted to tell and show with this games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
