Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't say this is my favorite of the new Star Wars Trilogy\\, it had moments I was very much not a fan of. That being said\\, over all\\, I really enjoyed the movie. I love that they didn't bow to fan theories and I absolutely adored Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Holdo. I know a lot of people seem to hate the character\\, and on my first viewing\\, I wasn't sure about her\\, but after seeing the movie again\\, I loved her. She didn't cow-tow to the main characters\\, she had a plan and pulled it off in a very similar manner to how Leia would have. I admit\\, I teared up a few times when Carrie was on the screen\\, some of her lines took on a lot more gravity now than they did when the movie was filmed. And I thought\\, Mark Hamill\\, once again\\, proved his chops as an actor. I don't agree with some of the things they did with the character\\, but he made you believe they were choices Luke could have made. As I said\\, over all\\, a really fun movie!","true":true}
