Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was both good and disappointing\\,  yes it was a good movie butt I'm so utterly disappointed with how thay are treating the heros\\, Luke\\, Leia\\, Han etc. Star wars is huge because of these Heros because of how much the fans connected to these heros\\, how thay were built up in our imaginations over the last 40 years. Honestly what we fans want to see is a story continuation of these heros not new ones at least not yet. Why Hollywood aka Disney cant understand this i dont get. We want to see Luke kick ass as a full on Jedi Master teaching the next generation\\, we want to see Han swooping in to save the day. What we dont want to see is our heros die off one by one\\, and the next generation take their place. I mean yes eventually the new heros will take over but let that be in the next 3 movies\\, we (the fans) who have waited years to see our heros again patiently and impatiently beyond excited that thay will be together again only to not see them together to not see them with more wisdom and strength that we all expected from them.  The disappointment is almost too much to bare. And then to hear the director state that the heros need to die because thay will take the fan focus from the new characters... he is basically saying our opinions\\, our hopes dont matter\\, that all the years of waiting\\, hoping and dreaming don't matter. Honestly Disney just give us what we want\\, we know Luke\\, Leia\\, and the rest can't go on forever\\, we know especially after Carrie Fishers death that thay are limited but give us that one last hoorah\\, to see what we have waired years for to see and then we will open heartedly with gladness watch\\, love and follow all your new characters in the numberless sequels with the same eager anticipation we have for the last 30+ years. But now its too late\\, so I say with the same attitude you have used towards our hopes\\, wants and dreams for star wars\\, Disney up yours!","true":true}
