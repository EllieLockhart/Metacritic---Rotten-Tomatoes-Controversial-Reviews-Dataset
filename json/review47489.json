Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What is with all these people saying it's horrible? I just finished it and I have watched all since the beginning. I loved it.. Yes cheese lines every once in a while\\, but the whole film starts moving half way through and loved all of it till the end.. Really I have no clue why everyone is so butt hurt. Just go see it yourself\\, don't listen to them. Make your own mind up. That's what I did and it ended up being dope!","true":true}
