Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was Horrible! I'm not going to spoil it but whoever approved some of these scenes needs to have their heads examined! You'll know which scenes when you watch it. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy should be ashamed of themselves.","true":true}
