Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so disappointing. There are some really cool visual effects and imagery in this movie\\, but SO much of storylines and plot just didn't make any sense. The humor was juvenile and irritating. I'm even feeling like The Last Jedi worse than the prequels and I like to pretend those didn't even exist. I'll refrain from getting into details\\, because I don't want to spoil anything - but I could probably rant about just about every scene in the movie. It did\\, however have the most visually awesome scene involving light speed\\, but the even the story behind that is flawed. A true Star Wars fan will be disappointed with this movie.","true":true}
