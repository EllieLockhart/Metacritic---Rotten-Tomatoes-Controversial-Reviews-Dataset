{"101487":132310,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-05-30","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If The Force Awakens was elementary schoolyard fanfiction.  The Last Jedi is the 'deep\\,' 'thought provoking' and 'clever' fanfiction writing of a teenager in junior high.  I'll just list off the problems I had with the movie. \/\/ \\\"General HUGS\\\"  Did anyone find that funny?  It's like they saw a MCU movie and thought \\\"yea\\, we can do that humor\\\" \/\/ The whole smarmy \\\"mmm\\, I don't have a plan\\, there's no plan\\, stop asking me if we have a plan\\, oh is that a mutiny? Mmm.  Well guess what\\, mmm.  I actually had a plan\\, bet you are surprised\\, mmm\\\" act  from CPT blue hair is just\\, why?  It didn't add any suspense to the story.  It didn't make the movie long space ship chase any better\\, it only made me dislike her character\\, so much so that at the end when she rammed the ship into the other ship\\, I was just like\\, \\\"okay...bye?\\\"  It's not clever\\, that wasn't a 'twist' \/\/ The Leia thing;  Come on\\, man.  It would have been better to send off her character if she was left in space.  It would have been harsh\\, it would have been hard hitting\\, boom just like that\\, gone.  But you wanted to do a crummy 'fake out' because you think that's what makes great writing.  Imagine if Ned Stark's head just floated back onto his neck and he was like \\\"yass\\, Im okay!\\\"  and GRRM was like \\\"haha nope\\, I'm going to destroy this character too!\\\"  Was that scene supposed to be deep and emotional? The flying through space thing? \/\/ Casino thing\\, didn't provide anything.  Lucas did a better job at this with the podracing nonsense in The Phantom Menace.  \/\/ Thanks for making Yoda reappear but as a mischievous riddle muppet\\, real nice.  Classy. \/\/ Thanks for the soap opera meets anime encounter between Finn and Phasma\\, real cool for making the characters that are actual good have minor parts. \/\/ Wow\\, the great big bad sith lord killed just like that\\, okay.  Neat.  Glad that went somewhere.  Darth Maul was a more intricate character than that. \/\/ Thanks for destroying Luke's character. \/\/ And again with the cool characters being under utilized\\, thanks for under utilizing Finn\\, that character who used to work for the enemy.  yeah\\, better not develop his character or keep him near Rey\\, would be ashamed if he were to outshine your cardboard lead. \/\/ It must be noted that my main beef with this movie is the writing.  I believe the actors did the absolute best they could with the script they were given.  It's not the actor's fault that Rose was a terrible character.  And as far as the visuals go\\, it's easy for a company as large as Disney to make the visuals and CGI look good.  So it's hard to commend them for it.  \\n","true":true}
