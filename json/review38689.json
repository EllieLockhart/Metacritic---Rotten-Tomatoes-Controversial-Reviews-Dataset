Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst thing a movie like this can be is boring. Much like Rogue One\\, every character seems to have all the passion and personality sucked out of them\\, and seemed lifeless even by Star Wars standards. The action scenes were nonsensical and lacking in tension. This movie desperately needed a re-write and maybe 40 minutes cut from it. There were some interesting and new ideas brought up\\, but they were executed poorly. Besides those\\, this was mostly a retread (and not even in a fun sort of way like The Force Awakens) and even the actors seemed bored.","true":true}
