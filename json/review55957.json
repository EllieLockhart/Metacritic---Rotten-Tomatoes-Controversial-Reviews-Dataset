Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson successfully met and exceeded my expectations and delivered an exciting\\, unpredictable and refreshing entry into the Star Wars saga. The film does not play it safe like TFA\\, and instead leans on the hope that audiences will trust that the risks the film is taking will pay off throughout the film. Spoiler alert: they do. Beautiful cinematography throughout the film\\, I was consistently in awe of the lovely settings we were thrown into. A lot of unforgettable cinematic moments involving Rey\/Kylo. I am in love with the new direction this movie has taken the saga in\\, and hope that JJ Abrams doesn't bring it full circle in the next film and instead lifts off the shoulders of this film into a more exciting direction.","true":true}
