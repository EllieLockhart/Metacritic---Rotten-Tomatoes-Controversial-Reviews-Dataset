Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointed!\\nNo payout for Luke\\, no payout for Rey\\, no payout for Snoke.\\n\\nThe whole setup of the first film is wasted\\, the last 3rd of this film was for nothing. Del Toro's character was wasted\\, turned out to be a co-murderous douche.\\nThis movie was such a waste and a letdown.\\n\\nThe only way it can be saved in the next movie is if Rey wakes up and it was all a dream\\, dallas style.\\n\\nSo disappointed!\\n\\nI paid for my whole family to see it in IMAX3D\\, with concessions\\, totaling $120\\, all to watch the biggest rip-off of a movie that had access to the best minds in the world and the biggest budget. Thanks Disney for wasting our time\\, money and a one shot opportunity to enrich and further the Star Wars narrative.","true":true}
