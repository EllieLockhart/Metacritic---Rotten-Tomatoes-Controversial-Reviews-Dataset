Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cringeworthy abomination! The other reviews here on RT give a good summary of the multitude of significant problems with TLJ\\, especially the weak plot and deliberate attempt to scorn\\, subvert and eviscerate the mythos and lore surrounding the Jedi. If you have any fond memories of the original trilogy\\, avoid this monstrosity.","true":true}
