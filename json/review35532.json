{"101487":175097,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-21","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The last Jedi hints that things aren't always as simple as good vs evil. I would have liked them to hit that note harder with more philosophical conversations but I also liked Matrix Reloaded so maybe not everyone would be on board with that. Traditionally Star Wars has been more of a action thrill ride through and through but the action in this ride has more complex motivations which I think brings more depth to the Star Wars universe. This movie still has all the action and humor of a Star Wars movie but sometimes I felt like it was out of an obligation to have action and humor. This might be the darkest of all the films and the bleakest time for the rebels and the humor seems out of place and had the movie spent more time to hone in on the philosophies at play it would have strengthened the action even if there was less of it as a result","true":true}
