Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is my review of The Last of Us Part 2.\rWhile it took me a while to finish it (July 14)\\, I haven't read or watched any reviews and leaked information about the game prior to my first playthrough. Though I watched some trailers.\r\rStarting with Graphics and Gameplay.\rI can't say much about it but\\, if Naughty Dog made their best looking game\\, then this is it.\rEvery detail crafted in this game is high quality. The attention to detail for every interaction\ris also marvelous. The animations and motion capture are realistic.\r\rMusic is still a very strong point in this game. It adds to the immersion and emotion of the game.\rSound effects are also very good\\, and seemed like true-to-life.\r\rCan't say much about the story. After watching that most talked about scene\\, the game became predictable and boring. As you progress\\, this game is like doing the opposite what made the first game so compelling\\, so likable with characters who are relatable and interesting that anyone can feel like they're real people.\rThroughout the game\\, it became unexciting and depressing. Can't say much about how violence was being depicted on this game. There are times that certain points in the game should have been changed\\, but for the shock factor\\, it made through the final product.\rThis game felt like Naughty Dog's approach about revenge is to disassociate the fans from the first game and forget about it.\rThere were also scenes that I think should have been written better to have a better closure to plot points left behind from the first game and some scenes that i felt placed wrongly in the game. Some of these scenes were a flashback\\, that felt like telling a story too late.\r\rAs I close my experience with the game\\, it is unfair to not share one part I really liked\\, and it was the \\\"Birthday Gift\\\" sequence. It reminded me of what TLOU is all about.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
