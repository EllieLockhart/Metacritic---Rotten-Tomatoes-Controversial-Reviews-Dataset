Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This by far the most fan unfriendly destruction of a franchise that i have ever seen.  Never in my 40 years have I ever not wanted to see a Star Wars movie over and over again.  This movie was was a huge FU to the fans and the lore of Star Wars.","true":true}
