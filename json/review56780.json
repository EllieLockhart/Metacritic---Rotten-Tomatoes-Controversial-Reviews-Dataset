Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason I liked this movie at all was because it\u2019s Star Wars\\, but in reality\\, the plot is like a herd of cats. It\u2019s all over the place and full of social commentary. I would have let it pass\\, but someone keeps floating a story that we don\u2019t actually \u201cnot\u201d like it and I felt I should speak up. This movie disappoints.","true":true}
