Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best movies ever made. Luke's character are is perfect and fits his character amazingly.  Rey Finn and Poe all return and are better and more defined than they were in The Force awakens and the new character Rose add much needed heart.","true":true}
