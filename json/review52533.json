Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A huge disappointment. I have no doubt that Rian Johnson loves Star Wars\\, but he is not the right person for it. Bring back Gareth Edwards and his team. He understands Star Wars.","true":true}
