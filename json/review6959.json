Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the worst movies in the entire franchise. Disney could not have screwed up any worse with every opportunity they were given. The fact that \\\"Top Critics\\\" appraise this movie for God knows what reason is disgusting. Ryan Johnson should be replaced\\, he knows nothing about the lore\\, characters\\, or history.","true":true}
