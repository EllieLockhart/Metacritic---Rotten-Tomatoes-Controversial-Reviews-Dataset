Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a die hard Star Wars fan since I was 5 years old. I watched all of the movies at least 10 times. I saw this twice and theaters and the second time was better than the first! Personally I still think The Force Awakens was a better film but I still thoroughly enjoyed this! My only disappointment with The Last Jedi is that it creates more questions than it answers! Hopefully all of those questions will be answered in Episode 9! Highly recommend this film to all new and old Star Wars fans!","true":true}
