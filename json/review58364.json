Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A first viewing had me enjoying this film\\, however being visually entertained has nothing to do with liking the plot or story telling this movie offers\\, which is little to none in this case. It felt like a betrayal of the series\\, as it forgoes the most essential element of a good star wars movie\\, heck of any hero based stories at all\\, that is to say the Hero's Journey. I will say this right now\\, there is no hero in this new trilogy\\, or at least a relatable one as Rey does not struggle in these movies. She is already skilled and powerful without any effort\\, which is bad character building and story telling\\, this compounded with how disjointed this movie feels leads to a big mess of a cinematic experience that only is Star Wars in name. I feel sorry for Mark Hamill as they completely disrespected Luke in this movie\\, as he acts out of character the whole time\\, like they forgot his Hero's Journey of the Original trilogy. Luke would have never acted the way he did in this movie if the original movies were adhered to\\, which they were not. I could go on and on\\, but this movie is bad. A good movie does not have you begin questioning it during and even immediately after viewing it\\, which was an immediate red flag for me. So this movie overall is not a good continuation of this franchise\\, it is even more poorly executed than The Force Awakens which while movie 7 was bad as a Star Wars film it at least could be built upon\\, The Last Jedi complete makes it so the story cannot continue in a fashion that would please fans of the original films. I don't recommend this film to anyone.","true":true}
