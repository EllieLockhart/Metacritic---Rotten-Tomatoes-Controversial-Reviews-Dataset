Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed.... After episode 7 and Rogue One\\, I was expecting the same tense thrill ride... But it didn't come until the end of the movie... I get they are setting up the new era and the story was great idea but I feel the movie was flat and slow. The start made me think I was in for pure excitement but it quickly fritters off to just story telling... The Rey\/Kylo fight scene was awful\\, some of the worst choreography I've seen in a long time\\, even episodes 1-3 were better in that sense and they are terrible.. Lukes return was an anticlimax. Introducing new force powers was great idea but sided on silly at times and whose idea was it to make this movie a comedy? That fell short also. But after waiting for a long period of time waiting for something to happen we finally got to the climax of the movie and it was in true Star Wars form\\, nail biting stuff.... It was a good effort and thought out but feel that Rian Johnson failed to keep the essence of the nerve wracking movies that came before and he over thought it. Saying that it does set up for a potentially good final movie and I'm so happy to hear that JJ Abrams is taking the reigns.... Verdict\\, great idea but poorly executed... Back seat star wars fans will enjoy this\\, hardcore star wars fans will feel cheated ","true":true}
