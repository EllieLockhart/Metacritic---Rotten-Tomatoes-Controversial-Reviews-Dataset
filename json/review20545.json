Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've just signup to RT solely to write review of this utter garbage. I've seen it tonight. Being a moderate fan of SW I can surely tell you that the pleasure of watching it was somehow comparable to being sodomized by a retractable baton. If I felt this way just think of what real fans feel. Rian Johnson took a huge dump on the saga\\, everything that people wrote about inconsistency and stupid plot\\, flat\\, non-SW saga characters is true. And 90% of critics is a f* joke! 90% my ass!","true":true}
