Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So so disappointed.  Plot\\, writing\\, humor was horrible.  Thought this was gonna be the best one.  Rogue One gave me hope with Disney.  The Force Awakens opened doors to a whole new Star Wars\\, and then Rian Johnson destroyed it.  Their franchise is done.  So\\, so sad.","true":true}
