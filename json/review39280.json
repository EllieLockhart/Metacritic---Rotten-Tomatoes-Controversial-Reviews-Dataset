Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this film has some good qualities\\, the sound as always is phenominal\\, some of the visual scenes are fantastic.  but none of that matters\\, because this film reducaed Luke Skywalker to sociopathic paranoid hopeless bully.  And to make matters worse\\, it is pl;ainly obvious he was written this way to be a cheap plot device to provide the motivation for Kylo Ren.  This movie makes it clear that star wars is now only interested in conitnuing to make films for years and more importantly make money.  They fndamentally changed a beloved character in the worst way poissible and used this movie to setup a continual cycle of \\\"new\\\" heroes.  This movie failed to address any of the intrigue and mystery of the last film.  This film should be called Episode 8: It Doesnt matter.  Who is Snoke? it doesnt matter.  Who are Reys parents? it doesnt matter.  Is Snoke a sith? it doesnt matter.  I could continue but whats the point.  This film threw Luke Skywalker under the bus in the name of making sure that they can continue to make movies for as long as it is making money.  This movie killed Star Wars.","true":true}
