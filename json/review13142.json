Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t know why people are rating this movie so badly (specifically audience). I am not a hardcore Star Wars person but I have seen all the movies and this was my favorite of the new movies that have come out. It was original\\, had some great unexpected twists\\, phenomenal action sequences\\, and spectacular performances from Daisy Ridley and Mark Hammil. Loved it!","true":true}
