Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't hate it as much as everyone else\\, but the more I think about it\\, the less I like this movie. I was really excited to see it after Rogue One\\, too. I won't be seeing anymore Rian Johnson Star Wars movies because he obviously isn't a Star Wars fan. That wasn't Luke Skywalker. At least Mark Hamill did a great job with the bad script that he had!","true":true}
