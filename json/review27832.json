Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Personally I think this is a great movie. Interesting twists you don\u2019t see coming\\, something fresh after the enjoyable but ultimately unoriginal force awakens. My only real gripes are the Leia in space scene and the fact we don\u2019t really learn anything about snoke. Is it better than empire or a new hope? Probably not\\, but to have a user score anywhere near the level of the prequel movies is just plain ridiculous","true":true}
