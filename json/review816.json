Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent addition to the Star Wars saga. Though I admit a good deal of filler went into the mix\\, the mythos of the force was preserved in a way few other films in this franchise have done. With complex characters in conflicting positions\\, The Last Jedi will keep you guessing and hoping til the last frame.","true":true}
