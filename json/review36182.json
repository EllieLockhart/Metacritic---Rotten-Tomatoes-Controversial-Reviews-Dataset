Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was fresh\\, interesting\\, and took every trope and smashed it into the ground. Go into this movie with an open mind\\, ready to see legends turned into real people and lone wolves knocked back into place where they belong\\, and you'll have a great time.","true":true}
