Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I wasn't with my kids I would of walked out.  Intergalactic magic tricks that kill you? Mary Poppins in the cold of space? Obligatory game of thrones tree and class warfare planet complete with animal abuse?  Who's snoke? Anybody can be a jedi if they kinda try. Just a model UN conference flying around in the millenials falcon.  There were some good scenes per say\\, but this is on par with phantom menace and clones as the worst of this enterprise and doesn't project well for the Disney. Just horrible writing.","true":true}
