Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Acting is well done Luke does great he makes sense\\, the character interactions are great\\, however the story and subplots or boring. i found myself bored many times during the movie the action scenes are boring. They throw in random crap just cause they wanted to the casino ark and speeder plot at the end are pointless.","true":true}
