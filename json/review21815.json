Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just downright\\, bad storytelling. The movie insists on \\\"subverting expectations\\\"\\, for the sake of \\\"subverting expectations\\\"\\, which ultimately leads to a multitude of shortcomings. The story has little progression\\, the character's arcs and characteristics are completely thrown by the wayside\\, there's WAY too much off-putting humor\\, and the Star Wars universe\/lore itself gets deconstructed to the point where it feels spiteful. Rian Johnson clearly doesn't understand Star Wars\\, let alone have a care for telling a cohesive\\, and honorable story. Don't waste your time watching this dumpster fire","true":true}
