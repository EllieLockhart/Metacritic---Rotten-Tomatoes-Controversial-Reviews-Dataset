Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it is by no means perfect\\, and in fact is noticeably flawed it is without question so fantastic and so much deeper than previous entries. It is everything Star Wars but with a layer unseen in the franchise.","true":true}
