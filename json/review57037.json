Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a chaotic mess. Beautiful\\, but a mess. The story and tone is all over the place. This film doesn't know if it wants to be an Avengers movie\\, a heist movie or Star Wars movie. The film lacks any sort of tension and you certain in every scene that the good guys will prevail. This is because from the beginning of this film\\, the antagonist are incompetent thugs that cannot do anything right. The Force Awakens at least conveys the First Order as a threat.  To have tension the bad guys have to win sometimes. In this film that never happens. In fact\\, none of the major Characters of this trilogy die. They avoid death\\, sometimes\\, like in Leia's case\\, laughably so. \\nCharacters who have gone through their own arcs have regressed. Snoke is under utilized to the point that To if he wasn't in the films\\, it wouldn't have changed the story. He is very diferent than how he appeared in the Force Awakens\\, \\n\\nYou don't need to be a hater to dislike this film. This isn't just a bad Star Wars film that the old guard fans hate because it is something new. It is fundamentally a bad film\\, that makes too many story telling mistakes. Good looks don't make a good movie. Telling a good story does and this Star Wars film fails to do that.","true":true}
