Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed The Last Jedi more than I liked The Force Awakens. I loved TFA but compared to TLF it felt it was stagnant and didn't take many risks\\, it tried to stay true to the Star Wars story. What I loved so much about TLJ is that every scene was a risk and every character had a conflict within themselves that they had to overcome. Unlike TFA it was very unpredictable. In addition\\, there were many scenes and dialogue that really resonated wth me and the people I watched it with. Rian Johnsonn created visually stunning and truly compelling story that really resonated with me. I am really looking forward to Episode 9 .","true":true}
