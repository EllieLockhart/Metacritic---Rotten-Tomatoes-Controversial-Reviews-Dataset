Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney is going through a lot withthe Starwars Battlefront controversy by gretty EA and now the last jeti backlash comon guys it's a great movie only real Starwars fans understand that it's in my top 3 fav Starwars movies the box office sails is going well but in the Last Jeti SPOLIERS where Luke dies and the jokes pissed  people off and that's what this move did well it's the most diverse Movie of all time people need to understand that this is a great movie","true":true}
