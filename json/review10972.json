Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having already seen the movie twice I can honestly say I love it. I didn't anticipate the twists and turns\\, but they made sense. The characters got a chance to prove they're human with flaws\\, and we got to witness the most epic misdirect in SW history.","true":true}
