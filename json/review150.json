I love the story very much both main quests and side quests. I would say this game has the BEST WRITER EVER. Main story is intense and has a lot of plot twists and side stories\\, some are hilarious\\, some made me shed tears. Yakuza 0 is the epitome of how to create great story for a game. GREAT MINI GAMES are also one thingMy first Yakuza I have great experience more than I have expected. I love the story very much both main quests and side quests. I would say this game has the BEST WRITER EVER. Main story is intense and has a lot of plot twists and side stories\\, some are hilarious\\, some made me shed tears. Yakuza 0 is the epitome of how to create great story for a game. GREAT MINI GAMES are also one thing that need to be mentioned. This game contains several great mini games and some are super fun\\, such as Cabaret Club\\, Real estate business. Seriously I spent 60 hours+ into the game\\, more than half are from mini games and side quests. It is safe to say that Yakuza is one of the best games in term of making mini games as well.\r\rCombat system is good\\, not the best though. It is more like Street fighter in 3 dimensions\\, rather than other action games like Batman. The way enemies attacking you is kind of random\\, but it is still fun nonetheless. There are many cool animations when you use heat gauge\\, especially with new environment or equipment. It is subjective one but those who like fighting should like this one as well.\r\rNext is cutscenes. There are many cutscenes here. and again ONE OF THE BEST CUTSCENES game I ever saw in my 20 years gamer. Facial expressions look so real\\, they thrill me every time. Voice acting is top notch too.\r\rOne last thing I have to mention is the soundtracks. This game has ones of THE BEST SOUNDTRACKS ever. You may not notice while you playing the game because you may be busy with fighting but if you check out Youtube\\, there are tons of soundtracks and most of them are great\\, especially Kuze song.\r\rIn conclusion\\, YAKUZA 0 strongest strengths are  STORY\\, MINIGAMES\\, CUTSCENES and SOUNDTRACKS. Combat is good too but it is subjective one. Game length is long. No negative comes to my mind at all. Definitely deserves my 10\/10 score. However\\, this game has a ton of texts to read and sometimes long cutscenes\\, so those who don't like reading\\, might not enjoy as much. I will look forward to play KIWAMI 1 and KIWAMI 2.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
