Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After the force awakens ending\\, I was so interested and anxious to see the follow up movie. I was anxious to see the knights of ren background\\, luke vs kylo\\, more background as to what made kylo go to the dark side\\, and rey's parents. What I got was luke milking giant walruses\\, poor use of snoke's character\\, and unneccessary story lines that felt like I was watching another movie. For example Finn and rose's adventure. Kylo Ren has to be the worst villain I have seen. The writers make this guy look like a complete fool and idiot. They make rey look so much more superior than him and she barely has any training! Even though the rebellion is decimated\\, it still feels like the first order has no chance because kylo ren is leading them. And the fight between kylo and luke? Really? A hologram? How disappointing. Very disapointed in this movie in general. Wanted to love it. Can't be overly invested in a movie that is so slow\\, underdeveloped characters\\, and the least villainous character I have ever seen.","true":true}
