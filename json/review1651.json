Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a movie is entertaining\\, I certainly laughed in some parts and has unforgettable scenes.\\nSpoilers ahead! As a Star Wars movie\\, it sucks too much. With a Luke Skywalker totally wasted and twisted badly.\\nWhile the Star Wars films have been a reference for directors and artists of all kind\\, and others are copied or winked at Star Wars in some way\\, in this episode VIII they are copied badly\\, from other films that although are good\\, they are not Star Wars. You can find references and copies of Matrix scenes\\, Star Trek\\, Harry Potter\\, Hunger Games\\, The Neverending Story among others ... They are not winks\\, or easter eggs to those movies\\, they are cheap copies. It's sad that they do that to what was Star Wars.\\nNot to mention that they do not respect their own new characters ... The characters do not find surprises\\, the surprises are for the fans\\, and they are unpleasant surprises to watch.\\nThis is not Star Wars. It's entertainment\\, it's visually well-made\\, but it's not Star Wars ...","true":true}
