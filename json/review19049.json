Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's fine but there is really nothing new here and some plot lines are just there to drag out the time with nothing to show for them in the end.  There was defnitely a lot of boredom to go around for a good chunk of the film which is insane to me when you think of all the possibilities and wonder one could achieve with Star Wars. It isn't a film I would ever rewatch since nothing was overly memorable. But there is nothing wrong or terrible about it. Just more of the same.","true":true}
