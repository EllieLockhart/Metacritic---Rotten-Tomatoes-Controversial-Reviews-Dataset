Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the holidays\\, meaning Disney is about to release a new addition to the greatest series of movies that have shaped generations for the last few decades. As a Star Wars fan all my life\\, I can honestly say I've never felt so betrayed. The plot had infinite plot holes\\, countless errors\\, horrible character development\\, atrocious action and what's even worse is how they make your childhood heroes out to be. This year it wasn't the Grinch\\, but Disney that stole Christmas\\, would not see again and it may have ruined Star Wars.","true":true}
