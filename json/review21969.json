{"101487":148628,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-12-27","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just terrible. Critics are useless. Look at the difference between the fans and critics and you can see what BS the critics review are. This movie is garbage.  Luke is a miserable old wretch on an island and the evaporates at the end ??? What a waste of 40 years of waiting for Luke to bring back the Jedi!!  So many things about this movie are Terrible. The FANS will never watch this movie again.","true":true}
