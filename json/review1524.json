Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long fan (I saw the original at 4 years old)\\, this is my most favorite of all. It brings back the mysticism of the force while also showcasing that everything isn't black and white\\, completely good or evil. Without revealing spoilers\\, I personally am satisfied with Rey's parentage and while I'd love to know more about another character\\, considering the outcome\\, it doesn't matter. As Kylo Ren says himself\\,  \\\"forget the past...\\\"\\, which he says in the trailers so no spoiler there either. Great sendoff for Carrie Fisher and... other(s) as well.","true":true}
