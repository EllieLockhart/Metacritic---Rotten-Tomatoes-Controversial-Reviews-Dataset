{"101487":113375,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-20","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Clearly Rian Johnson wanted to do more than make a simple crowd-pleasing Star Wars movie; he wanted to make a good movie that added new things to the Star Wars saga. Personally\\, I think it is brilliant and deserves more than its current 49% audience score. Maybe\\, in time\\, more fans will come to enjoy the movie. Or maybe it will remain the most divisive Star Wars movie ever. Spoilers below.\\n\\nThe movie takes Luke Skywalker in the opposite direction that anyone (including Mark Hamill) would expect him to be taken\\, thus failing to deliver the wise\\, successful Jedi Master Luke we all expected. (Hamill seems to have clarified his earlier comments\\, saying they were his reaction upon reading the script. \\\"It took me a while to get around to [Rian Johnson's] way of thinking\\, but once I was there\\, it was a thrilling experience.\\\") Perhaps one's ability to enjoy the movie hinges on whether you can accept this version of Luke.\\n\\nOn the other hand\\, I think the director took the setup from The Force Awakens to an extreme (but logical) conclusion. It is J.J. Abrams' fault we got a sequel trilogy where Leia\\, Luke and Han don't live happily ever after\\, the galaxy is again in a Rebels vs. Empire conflict\\, and Luke runs away to an uncharted planet after he fails to prevent his nephew from turning to the dark side. And The Force Awakens did begin to ask questions like\\, \\\"What happens when you actually meet the human beings behind the legends?\\\"\\n\\nThe movie somehow makes a slow-mo chase with capital ships more interesting than it should be. Granted\\, I do wonder why Admiral Holdo did not share her plans for escaping the First Order fleet with Poe\\, but it did not ruin the movie for me. I think she did not want to indulge the cocky young hot-shot who just got demoted\\, and she didn't anticipate that he would try such a crazy scheme. And she could not have anticipated that the hacker that Rose and Poe enlisted would overhear the Resistance plan over a communicator and tell the First Order all about it when he was caught. For once\\, the crazy long-shot scheme actually doesn't work out\\, and Holdo and Poe's failure to communicate results in needless deaths. Like Luke's story arc\\, this part of the story is about learning from failure. \\n\\nMany ask why\\, if Holdo could destroy many First Order ships by making a suicide hyperspace jump into it\\, why haven't the rebels\/resistance been using unmanned ships to destroy enemy ships in a similar manner? Maybe it's so crazy\\, no one has tried it before Holdo; or hyperdrives are too expensive for this to be done frequently. Or\\, you have to get really close to the enemy and have time to perform precise calculations in order to pull it off. Holdo was only able to do it because the First Order was focused on the transports until it was too late.\\n\\nThe movie provides an answer to who Rey is that is IMO much better than all the crazy fan theories\\, and avoids the implication of one of the heroes abandoning her on Jakku when she was young. Now for Episode 9\\, we will have a showdown between the last Skywalker and a \\\"nobody\\\" who is nevertheless strong in the light side of the force. (Probably not the first time a force user has come from \\\"nobody\\\" parents--that is where the Jedi of the prequels got most of the younglings). The movie sidesteps who Snoke is. (He is\\, for the purposes of the trilogy so far\\, Palpatine Part 2. I imagine a book will eventually explain more). The result of Rey\\, Kylo Renn and Snoke meeting is a great lightsaber battle unlike others that came before.\\n\\nThe final battle on Crait is great\\, and allows Luke to demonstrate a new force power\\, make amends and inspire the galaxy once again. The movie plays with our expectations of what should happen in a Star Wars movie. It deconstructs\\, yet also celebrates\\, the themes running through the saga. It pays homage to a couple moments in the original movies while providing a fresh spin on them. It explores themes of failure\\, lineage and legend.","true":true}
