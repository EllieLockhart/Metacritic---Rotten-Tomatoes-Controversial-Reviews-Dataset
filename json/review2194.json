Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible re-imagining and betrayal of the entire franchise lead by inter-sectional SJW propaganda messaging. The plot is abandoned in favor of this messaging and all build up from the Force Awakens\\, which in comparison is a very good movie\\, is thrown away. Director Rian Johnson fails to live up to expectations to create an enjoyable\\, realistic\\, or organized story. He demands you suspend your belief in Star Wars and accept his SJW message and ridiculous forced plot. Acting by Daisy Ridley and Kylo Ren is somewhat better than the last installment however Finn's character is also betrayed and his acting suffers to a terribly written and performed forgettable chubby Asian girl.\\n\\nThis movie has killed the trilogy\\, which will play 2nd or 3rd fiddle to even he original trilogy and perhaps even the prequels.","true":true}
