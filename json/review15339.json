Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll keep it short and sweet. I think that it's ridiculous that people are complaining about the storyline not being a Star Wars storyline. Episode IV\\, Episode VI and Episode VII all have the same basic ploto that leaves Episode V with the only different plot. I don't  mention the first three episodes because if you were a true Star Wars fan you know why.  Granted their were a few questionable scenes in Episode VIII\\, .no big deal\\, you can't please everyone. But if you want to see giant space stations being blown up at the end of every Star Wars movie I feel very sorry for your imagination and creativity as a Star Wars fan. I liked that it was diffn. I thought the way Luke was written out was both respectful and in true Jedi tradition as with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It could have been worse\\, would you want to see him turn to the dark side? I don't think so. Being a true fan of the Jedi and the light side of the force it would have ripped my heart out. Like was the ultimate hero to me growing up. Stop your whining and be happy that Disney is doing a better job with Star Wars than the creator did with those garbage prequels\\, we all know we don't want see it ever go in that direction again. They're doingu a better job by far. Stop complaining.","true":true}
