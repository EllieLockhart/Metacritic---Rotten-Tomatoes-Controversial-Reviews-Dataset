Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't believe that I paid money to watch this garbage.  The Last Jedi is easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made.  I'm including the prequels\\, specials\\, cartoons\\, and even the Ewoks TV show from the 1980's.\\n\\nAll of my hope was destroyed by watching this film.  It was so bad that it took a while (several days) to process just how bad and viscerally offensive this film was.  It ignored its protagonist (Rey) and had her do little more than swing a saber and lift up some rocks.  It injected political opinions that have no business in a Star Wars movie and added a bunch of scenes that don't tie particularly well with the rest of the movie.\\n\\nThis is a hot mess that should be removed from the Star Wars library.","true":true}
