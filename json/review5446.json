Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite the bad press I decided to keep an open mind and watch this movie.... Sometimes you shouldn't keep an open mind....\\nThis is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The director apparently also wrote this incomprehensible mess of a story. I can only assume his career is now over? I'm familiar enough with the previous Star Wars movies to appreciate how much this completely fails to further the story. If you want to be made to feel depressed\\, frustrated and embarrassed for the actors involved I highly recommend this movie.","true":true}
