Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed it. A few cheesy jokes aside (which are a fixture in each prior movie was well)\\, this this film was a strong departure from the prior story lines and sets the stage from some very interesting plot scenarios. While in retrospect the running time was a bit long\\, I didn't notice it dragging on during the film itself. Looking forward to the next one!","true":true}
