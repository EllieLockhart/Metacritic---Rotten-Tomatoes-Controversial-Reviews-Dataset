Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Couldn't give it zero stars\\, would if I could. This is NOT a Star Wars movie\\, this is a SOY WARS movie. Ruin Johnson should not be making a trilogy\\, he shouldn't have even been allowed to make a SINGLE film. This is stupid. Boo. I wish I could give this -5 stars\\, or -50\\,000\\,000 stars\\, because I cannot more highly say this movie is the worst movie ever made for culture.","true":true}
