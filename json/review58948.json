Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The people that reviewed this poorly seem to only care for power highs and the characters they have seen before. The point of Abby's character was not just to kill off the main character and get the audience pissed\\, then they would not have made her such a key character. It is to understand what is so wrong with revenge. It goes along the 'an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.' Ellie lost everything for revenge against Abby. When people look at the story line without some beautiful story of Ellie winning\\, they rate the game as a 0. Ellie and Abby are so similar by the end; I am surprised the homophobes are not rooting for Abby.\rI don't like everything about the game. I played the first game\\, and hoped this new game would be even better. But\\, there is something wrong in my mind about having everything play out the way an audience wants it to in an apocalyptic setting. I like a story with a tragic ending. Maybe that isn't the game for everyone\\, but still. Y'all are acting like Naughty Dog just took your Binky away.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
