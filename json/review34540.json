Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best Star Wars yet. The director's intent was to create drama and division within the audience. He has definitely succeeded by crafting a film that defines what a modern Star Wars film should be. In the words of the great George Lucas\\, it was indeed \\\"beautifully made\\\"\\, and the most beautiful at that. If you love big screen action\\, intense drama\\, shocking twists\\, and a rollercoaster of a thrilling story with some of the best visuals. I honestly can't recommend The Last Jedi enough!","true":true}
