Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How is it so hard to make a good Star Wars film. They have a simple premis\\, with relatively simple characters\\, it's the pop  you make a movie out of the title crawl from Empire\\, yet still get it wrong?\\n\\nEdit: I watched this movie again yesterday -and i still feel tge same. I can kinda get Luke\\, so that doesn't bother me as much as most other viewers. Unfortunately\\, Ray is still an unbelievable and unlikeable Mary Sue\\, and every other character was just poorly written\\, as if the previous movies never existed.\\nThe only way this movie even becomes a 5\/10 is if you look at it as a stand alone\\, and even then you have to ignore the obvious politics\\, badly written characters\\, weird cuts and a storyline that leaps rather than flows","true":true}
