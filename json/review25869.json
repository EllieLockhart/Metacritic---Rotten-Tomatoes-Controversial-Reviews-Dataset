Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not good.  As a stand alone movie with no established lore or rules\\, it may be okay....  But that's not the case here.  There are established Star Wars lore and rules.  This movie sought to break and undo all of them\\, seemingly wanting to toss aside 7 previous films over 40 years to do it's own thing.  Again\\, perhaps fine as a stand-alone\\, but not as a numbered sequel.  Sorry.  I saw this opening night at the theater and was so disappointed.  Because of this movie\\, I will not be seeing the Rise of Skywalker in the theater\\, the first time in the history of Star Wars I haven't gone to the theater to see one.  (Saw Ep IV in 1977 in the theater\\, and every one since.)","true":true}
