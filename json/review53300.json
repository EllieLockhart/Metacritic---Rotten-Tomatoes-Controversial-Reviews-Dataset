Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"CONS: \\n-Leia poppins\\n-Luke titty milk\\n-No good light saber duels\\n-Hux is a horrible joke\\n-1st order is laughing stock (like slap stick not funny joke) \\n-same old empire vs plucky rebels (no originality)\\n- ripped off scenes from ROTJ (throne room) \\n-ripped off scene from ESB (hoth battle)\\n-run out of fuel plot is dumb\\n-lasers now have arc drop in space??? wtf\\n-slowest \\, most boring space chase ever filmed\\n-casino planet DUMB\\n-disnified animals all over the place\\n-disney merchandise plugs all througout the movie\\n-male = bad \\, female = god (pc agenda crap) \\n-camera angles frequently felt amateurish \\n-did not feel like starwars\\n-they did luke dirty\\n-end luke scene \/ dies off planet \\, retarded af\\n-rose\\n\\n\\n\\nPros:  \\n-the film looks pretty\\, \\n-sounds awesome\\n-john williams score \\n\\nThis movie was VERY disappointing\\, and had  bad script writing\\, huge plot holes\\, PC agenda\\, Mary sue and a lot  plot contrivance) hollow characters with no arc or development\\, (they are just there to be there) bad humor placed in the worse places. too many jokes. All in all its  up a poorly directed movie\\, with a very weak story. They totally disregarded what the previous film set (which is odd for the 2nd movie in a trilogy)  Its almost like a parody of itself\\, kind of robot chicken & spaceballs type jokes\\, the film does not take itself seriously\\, and neither should you. (I know I didnt) \\n  \\n After seeing the movies and seeing reviews on here I  am Pretty convinced that the positive reviews are Disney shill bots doing damage control.\\n\\nrian Johnson & Disney took a dump on this film before lighting it on fire and throwing it the dumpster. \\n\\nThis is\\, without a doubt THE WORST starwars  to date. \\nrian johnson and kathleen keneddy should be fired and never let near a movie again. \\n(if ur not a SW fan you probably will like this film if you are\\, be prepared to not give a flying eff about starwars anymore)","true":true}
