Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan of the Star Wars Saga I was anxious about how TLJ would treat Luke (especially as I've heard Mark Hamill wasn't initially happy about his arc) However\\, I left the cinema having really enjoyed the film. It felt like a more 'Star Wars' film than TFA - the connections to the saga wern't there to highlight we have a Star Wars film but to move the story on. It was also more focused on the relationships between key characters\\, which was pleasing as the temptation to go 'bigger and louder' must of been there. \\n\\nThat isn't to say there weren't any mis-steps. I disliked the inclusion of Maz who seemed to be in fire fight for the sake of it (and to sell a Maz with rocket pack action figure?)\\n\\nHowever\\, I wasn't overly upset (like some reviewers!) about Leia in Space. Highlights she has a strong Force connection and it is latent but there. I also wasn't upset about some of the major plot twists\\, or Luke's arc. \\n\\nI am looking forward to the next instalment which I hope continues to push Star Wars into new directions.","true":true}
