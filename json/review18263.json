Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought The Force Awakens was weak. A rehash of A New Hope\\, with new\\, less complex characters\\, and headed in a less than an ideal direction with immersion breaking continuity issues. Then we got The Last Jedi...Not only did it fail to stay true to existing franchise\\, it threw away everything from the last film. It was almost a reboot as sequel to what felt like a reboot\\, in a franchise that did not need a reboot at all. Now though\\, the franchise kind of does need a reboot. Because The Last Jedi effectively ended the potential of a good followup sequel. It wrote itself into a corner\\, massively broke continuity\\, and was just a weak film over all. The prequel movies were bad\\, but they were prequels\\, they allowed for sequels to come along later and build off the original story. Instead we got a soft reboot\\, followed by a less soft reboot\\, back to back.","true":true}
