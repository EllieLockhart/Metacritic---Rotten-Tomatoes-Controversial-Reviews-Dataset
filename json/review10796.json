Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hands down worst SW in my opinion. I loved a lot of stuff that The Force Awakens set up for this new trilogy. Then JJ Abrams passed the ball to Rian Johnson so he could score the goal\\, but instead Rian took the ball and threw it out of the court. Bad Continuity\\, way too much cheap comic relief that was poorly timed\\, and an unbelievable amount of wasted potential. But I think one of my biggest problems with this film is that The First Order was portayed as a bunch of bumbling idiots instead of a cunning\\, brutal\\, relentless military group to be reckoned with like the Empire was\\, and I was hoping that The Knights of Ren would be more invovled in this movie\\, but intead they weren't even mentioned. TLJ felt like a Marval\/Disney movie\\, not Star Wars. Maybe Episode 9 will redeem some of the flaws\\, but overall TLJ has tainted the franchise.\\nIn JJ we trust.","true":true}
