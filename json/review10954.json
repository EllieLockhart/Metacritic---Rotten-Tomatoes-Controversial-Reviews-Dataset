Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Have been\\, and still am\\, a huge Star Wars junkie.  With that being said\\, this movie really disappointed.  Without writing a marathon post\\, Rian Johnson wrote and directed this\\, so this would fall on him.  TFA had some issues in it's own right and things to poke at\\, but that at least looked and felt like a Star Wars movie during most of it's duration.  TLJ just felt like a movie about characters in space somewhere.  Gone are all of the interesting characters we actually cared about.  Get ready for Episode 9...Rey defeats Kylo Ren who will freak out from time to time\\, the Rebels make a comeback\\, and Luke makes a cameo as a force ghost.  Oh\\, and Finn will somehow carry out important missions\\, will get captured\\, then escape.  All the while Poe will fly circles around the First Order in some new ship that will make a great Christmas toy.\\n\\nYou suck Rian Johnson.  You suck.","true":true}
