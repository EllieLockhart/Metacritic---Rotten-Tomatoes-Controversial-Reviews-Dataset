Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a confused film. It's hard to imagine that this was the best plot line they could come up with.\\n\\nSome potentially really interesting scenes ruined by a very lame joke. It felt clunky and slow with some great characters being cut off before they could be fleshed out properly or some iconic heroes not getting the exit they deserved.","true":true}
