Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"canto byte was a waste of time\\, and the whole plot of the \u00e2flying through space for an hour\u00e2? got boring after a while. Many things about this movie practically ruined the future of the Star Wars saga. Very sad to see this disappointment come to theaters.","true":true}
