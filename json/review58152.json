Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"wow. no character development... the original star wars you would know luke was the man... this weird movie tries to make everyone the main character. It starts with Bombers that have gravity bombs....in space..... this movie has too many problems with it. not going to a theater to watch the next one\\, going to wait for red box. This movie maid me actually not excited for anymore star wars movies....just a shame.","true":true}
