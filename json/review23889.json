{"101487":152786,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-29","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"[Major Spoilers] (Taken from my post on Reddit) If we're not even looking at it as a Star Wars movie and putting TLJ as standalone\\, it still isn't a good movie. \\n- It has a half hour sub-plot which has a climax stemming from Finn and Rose parking illegally\\, and ultimately failing in their mission only to end up right back with the Resistance. They could have removed that sub plot and had Finn and Rose stay and nothing would have changed. It would have been the same movie and not have wasted a half hour of my time. \\n- Then there's the fuel plot\\, \\\"We're running out of fuel!\\\" Okay\\, just turn off the engines. \\\"But we'll slow down!\\\" How? You're in space and unless you hit something you'll just go forward endlessly and never lose momentum. Turn off the engines and just float\\, save fuel for maneuvering. It was the dumbest chase scene I've ever seen. I know it's high fantasy\\, but at least keep space consistent.\\n- Leia's supergirl moment was just funny to me mainly due to the movie expecting me to take it seriously.\\n- Rose was just a badly written character (Kelly Marie Tran is an absolute sweetheart\\, so please differentiate the character from the actress). Her sister just died and we're only given one scene of her grieving\\, then she's up on her feet and totally forgets about her. No story about her coming to terms with her sister's death. The romance was also terrible as it's literally\\, \\\"I'm in love with this ex-imperial out of nowhere.\\\" Imperials sacked and enslaved her colony\\, killed her sister\\, and you're now in love with one after 24 hours with him? Should have gone with a \\\"She slowly begins to trust him\\, despite his past\\\" story.\\n- Holdo and Poe's dynamic was hilarious. Rian attempted to make Holdo look smart and Poe look dumb\\, but Poe actually made the most sense out of the two of them. His mutiny was completely justified. The Resistance is a group of volunteer civilians\\, not professionally trained soldiers. They're scared\\, and need-to-know basis is not the correct tool in that sort of environment. She came across as having no plan to the crew and so the crew mutinied. If she had told them that never would have happened. The only evidence that we get that she's half-intelligent is having it told to us during her introduction\\, after that not one smart decision is made. Also her outfit was utterly ridiculous\\, especially on a supposed admiral.\\n- Kylo is still pretty whiny (well\\, tantrumy)\\, but is probably the most interesting character with actual depth. Shame about his mask though\\, it was a pretty good marketing tool.\\n- Hux goes from hero to zero in my eyes. Absolutely fantastic speech in TFA\\, and then he becomes an idiot in this movie.\\n- Rey is still overpowered without reason (Yes\\, I know TRoS twist family\\, but still she needed training).\\n- Luke was a depressed old man not indicative of Star Wars Canon or the EU. Cyborg Daddy Hitler can be redeemed\\, but that angsty teenager? Nope\\, gotta kill him. Really stupid what Rian did with Luke.\\n- Ultimately it came across as Rian not really knowing Star Wars at all\\, he couldn't properly write the characters\\, had no understanding of the universe\\, and filled the movie with our world's politics that came across as subtly as a cruise liner slamming into a harbor. Oh and then he started attacking those who were critical of the movie\\, which is a great way to alienate people and severely damage a franchise.\\n- There are other issues\\, but I honestly can't be bothered to write them all down.\\n*Edit - Oh yeah! There was also the U.S.S. Papa Johns with the two stupid looking cannons coming out of the bottom. That was funny.","true":true}
