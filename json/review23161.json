Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"loved it\\, everything it did was a breath of fresh air and I feel set up a very big unknown for episode 9. In a age of information and collective theory crafting\\, it is nice to know so little on the direction the movie will go. The story was amazing and the pacing was just right. I was intensely interested and WoWed by this movie so many it's crazy.","true":true}
