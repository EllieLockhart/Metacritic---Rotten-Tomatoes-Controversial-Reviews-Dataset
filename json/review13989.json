Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if you have not seen the movie yet do not read my review unless you have seen it already so star wars the last Jedi a good way to end the story of the Skywalkers and for it too open a new story for Rey and kylo ren and a really good last performance by the late Carrie Fisher as this was here true last film rest in peace carrie this movie leaves open alot of opportunity for the franchise it was sad to see luke die at the end but we will see him in 9 so over all I give this movie 5 \ud83c\udf1f because it was a really good movie and could be one of the good star wars movies of all time","true":true}
