Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Packed with action and emotions\\, it takes a very grounded approach to narrate a saga story. It is very moving when characters big or small stand up for their own fight. Although the \\\"hope\\\" keeps getting slimmer as the story progresses. Without spoiler I would just say the cleaver jokes inserted do not brighten the dark theme of the movie.","true":true}
