Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How can Rey lift up all those rocks\\, it took Luke so much mor effort in the other movies to learn that. Luke was so optimistic in the original films\\, and he didn't even want to kill the mass murderer that was Darth Vader\\, why would he want to kill his nephew?  Luke should have been so much more cool\\, he should have been able to lift all those rocks like Rey\\, he should have been able to do the Jedi's version of Sith lightning. They really took a dump on Skywalker's character. And Ben Solo doesn't even remotely look like his parents. At least choose an actor that looks similar. And how can Rey fight those train warriors with Snoke so well\\, there's no way she has the same level of battle experience.  I hate the direction that Star Wars is going\\, and I refuse to watch the next one.","true":true}
