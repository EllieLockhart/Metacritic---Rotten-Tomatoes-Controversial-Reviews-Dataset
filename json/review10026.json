Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great franchise that was completely ruined by this one movie.  The way they turned one of the most loved heroes of all time into a bitter old man was just plain stupid.  If I could have given zero stars I would have.","true":true}
