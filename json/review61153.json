Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I don't know what think about this game. But I know I need play more. I need to know what will happen with Ellie and Dina and JJThe game is one of the best I have played. The story broke my heart and it could be different. But it isn't\\, so they wanted to show us a story\\, a really hard story. But it is the story and it's Okey. I can live with it. Maybe I was going to enjoy with other story. Perhaps I would prefer playing with Ellie all the game or that Joel can be alive and we can see him taking care Ellie. At least a few hours or  a chapter. Because\\, we waited 7 years to can see him. And it's hard to support a game without our main character\\, the best character I played. But it's what they wanted to show us. So we have to play it and live with it because it's only a game. The most important game\\, in my opinion. But I can live with it. Again\\, in my opinion\\, all the people who made the game deserve we accept their job and we have to say thank themI am sorry for my English. I am Argentinian\u2026 Expand","true":true}
