Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While visually gorgeous\\, the movie itself is an absolute disaster. Totally disconnected from the lore and no progression from 'The Force Awakens'. Characters of the original trilogy are being disposed to make room for new ones that haven't been established yet. Amazed that this movie got greenlit. ","true":true}
