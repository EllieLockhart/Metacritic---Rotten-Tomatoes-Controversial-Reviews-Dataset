Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson is a trash writer that trolled fans with The Last Jedi. He killed every interested thread from Force Awakens. Who is Snoke? Nobody! Who is Rey? Nobody! What did Luke learn from the first Jedi temple? Nothing! Why does Rey have memory problems? Why did Luke leave a map to himself if he did not want to be found? What the hell is the point of purple hair lady and Rose? Why did he add all that filler with the casino scene?","true":true}
