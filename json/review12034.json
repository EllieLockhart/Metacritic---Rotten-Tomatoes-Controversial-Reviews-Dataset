Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan and this movie was a huge disappointment! What makes me even angrier than the movie is the people who claim to be true Star Wars fans and actually liked it. Those people will love anything that has the Star Wars name and don't care about a good story. Absolutely terrible!!","true":true}
