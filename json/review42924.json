Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so terrible. I didn't enjoy this and my 11 year old daughter wanted to leave. We stayed until the end but next time I will listen to her and walk out. It has a terrible plot that is full of silly plot holes. If you haven't seen it just be prepared to be underwhelmed. Maybe wait for Redbox and rent it.","true":true}
