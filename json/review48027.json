Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not perfect\\, this was another excellent entry in the ongoing saga\\, with some truly unexpected turns.  It definitely left me eager to see Episode IX!","true":true}
