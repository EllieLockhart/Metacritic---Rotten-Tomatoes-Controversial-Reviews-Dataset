Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Embarrassing film. It is a story about nothing. No one accomplishes anything\\, no one has motivations\\, no one thinks\\, everyone just do random stuff for random reasons. This film is ridiculously self-parodying\\, characters keep making inappropriate\\, unfunny jokes at inappropriate times and at moments incredibly childish. This film is targeted to children most of the time and Disney keeps vomiting politically correct non-sensical clich\u00e9s and all the cute little aliens so obviously focused on merchandising is a constant reminder that this is just a money-making machine. Disgusting. Shame on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB for allowing these fake critics to praise this rubbish. Don't believe me? Look at the audience's feedback. Disney must be paying these so-called critics with small golden Yoda dolls with Mickey ears. Liars and hypocrites.","true":true}
