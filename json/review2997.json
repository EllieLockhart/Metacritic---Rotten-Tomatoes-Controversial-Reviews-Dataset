Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Badly written & directed. If the critic's give this film a high score then it shows just how out of touch they are with people who actually go and watch films. \\n\\nIt's not about diversity or political correctness. It's about the film taking short cuts. Space battles too short and with crap dogfights between fighters. No actual lightsaber fight with Sith vs Jedi. \\n\\nDisney need to avoid making the mistake of ignoring Star wars fans. Star wars became great because Lucas kept it independent and saved it from studio Beaurocrats from making stupid decisions.","true":true}
