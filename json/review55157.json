Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in hoping to see something refreshing exciting and find answers to why the most powerful and hopeful Jedi was an out cast.\\nInstead I got generic action movie #437 interesting CGI though.\\nActing was average at best and the writing was horrible. Episode 3 was better and that's saying something!","true":true}
