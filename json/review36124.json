Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was amazing!  The story was leaps and bounds better then The Force Awakens\\, it's own unique story\\, not something borrowed from the original trilogy. From beginning to end this movie was exciting\\, funny\\, action packed and filled with surprises.  I found it to be pleasently unpredictable and I can't wait for episode IX now!","true":true}
