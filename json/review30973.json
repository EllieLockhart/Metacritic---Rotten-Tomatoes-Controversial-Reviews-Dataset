Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing. Finn and Rose's story should have been cut completely\\, Luke was wasted\\, Snoke didn't matter\\, it was just bad. It's like no one at Disney watched this before releasing it. I'm astounded that  this film has a 93% score right now. Critics were obviously paid\\, threatened\\, or have seriously fallen into group think. I was a pretty big fan of The Force Awakens and the new characters\\, but The Last Jedi failed to deliver.","true":true}
