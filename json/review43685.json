Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was such a disappointing movie not just as star wars but there are many dumb things added like lea FRICKING using the force when she clearly should have died. also space bombing runs there is no gravity what is the point????!!!!!! also the fight choreography was just terrible. also rose sacrifices her self for Finn when the whole resistance is at stake. also luke skywalker is completely out of character he has no hope when in the orginals that is some times all he has. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","true":true}
