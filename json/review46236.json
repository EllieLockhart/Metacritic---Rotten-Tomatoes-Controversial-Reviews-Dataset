{"101487":193256,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*** WARNING SPOILERS***\\n\\nOkay\\, let me start out by saying I'm a huge Star Wars fan from childhood\\, BUT\\, I'm also fair and objective when it comes to movies. I'm not a diehard fan that knows all about the Star Wars universe including Comics or TV shows.\\n\\nI gave this move 3 stars because after watching it and letting it sink in a bit\\, I give it 3 stars as a movie and 1 additional star because I'm a huge fan and can't help it regardless of some disappointments. However\\, as a critic of the movie itself\\, I have to stick to 3 stars and be fair. Here's 3 reasons why which I'll go into detail after:\\n\\n1) Deliberate Plot Direction and Holes To Contradict fan expectations (to surprise us\\, but not necessarily in a good way)\\n2) Lack of Realism to Support Deliberate Plot Direction\\n3) Funny In Most Places BUT Timing of Humour Seriously Off in Others\\n\\nThat being said I can understand some fan frustrations as I felt it myself during the movie. The reviews stating that they tore everything down and then rebuilt it again is partially true. I think things were torn down\\, but I don't know if everything was necessarily built right back up\\, at least not properly.\\n\\n1) At first\\, my reaction was that Force Awakens flowed a bit better with regards to story\\, which is true. Even though Force Awakens was inline with a New Hope plot wise\\, that doesn't mean it wasn't good with what it presented. I wasn't disappointed with it despite some saying it played it safe. It may have played it safe but it still had to be well put together\\, which it was.\\n\\nWith the Last Jedi I feel as if it deliberately went in directions because they were the complete opposite of what all fans were thinking for the past 2 years while waiting. This was however done without the foresight of the consequences of such actions. I think this is the number 1 reason for the disappointment some fans are experiencing.\\n\\nExample\\, everyone wondering who Snoke really is\\, and how he came to be. As a result\\, he's killed off unexpectedly without any background information on him at all. The consequence is\\, we're left confused as to what is going on and who can be the real bad force\\, as Kylo seems to be too conflicted and not mature enough in the force to be the bad one as a Leader.\\n\\nAnother perfect example of this is Rey's parents. Everyone has been wondering\\, is she a Skywalker? Is she a Princess? Who are her parents? As a result\\, she's from nobody important at all. It seems these deliberate decisions were made thinking\\, hey\\, everyone is thinking about this\\, so let's make it non-important or not fulfill it in any way. All of this without thinking of the consequence of such actions towards the story\\, plot\\, and saga. Sure\\, it surprised us as we weren't expecting it to go in that direction\\, but not necessarily in a good way at all. Makes sense you can't please everyone\\, that will always be the case. However\\, would you rather not please the 10% fans you can never please\\, or not please 50% of the fans because you didn't want to go in the direction that would please most for the sake of surprising everyone?\\n\\nI understand that the long term direction of Star Wars may be to emphasize that ANYONE can have the force and it doesn't have to be a Skywalker. Understood. But\\, then focus on this as a more detail story point and support it with more depth than merely making it a statement from Kylo to Rey (if he's being 100% honest with Rey to begin with). It could've been tied in to Luke's training with her to simply say he's learned that even though the force is strong in his family\\, the force can be with anyone\\, it's not owned by his family or the jedi (which he eluded to slightly). Afterall\\, Yoda doesn't look like a Skywalker\\, nor did Qui-Gon Jinn or any of the other Jedi from the pre-quels. We already know the force is not restricted to just the Skywalkers\\, so why is this a surprise? Luke may be the Last Jedi\\, but surely not the last one with force capability (hence Rey and the little boy at the end). Having the force and being trained in it as a Jedi are two different things.\\n\\n2) Now\\, getting into the objective reality of the movie. With some of the plot directions there comes reality that seems to have gone out the window.\\n\\nFirst\\, Rey's training on Ach-To didn't really feel like any training at all. And\\, I'm not saying any training at all compared to Empire Strikes Back with Luke and Yoda\\, I mean in any real sense of training. It seemed that Rey had a couple of sessions with Luke and that was it\\, no depth\\, no heritage\\, no explanations\\, no realism. Rey is very powerful with the force but it seems she is learning her skills on her own and picking up things quickly with no real training at all. The fact that she was with Luke for a short period of time and then went to face Snoke and Kylo mimics Empire Strikes Back for plot with Luke leaving Yoda to face Vader to help his friends\\, but it wasn't near as real or smooth like it. It felt more like if Obi-Wan introduced Luke to the force in a New Hope with Luke training with the training ball on the Millenium Falcon\\, then suddenly in the next scene he's going to face the Emperor and Vader thinking he can turn Vader back to the light side. I also understand there was a unique connection between Rey and Kylo but that connection was due to Snoke.\\n\\nSecond\\, Snoke being killed by Kylo although cheered in the movie theatre when I watched it\\, afterwards thought to myself\\, wait a minute. Snoke was just shown to demonstrate far superior force skills to both Rey and Kylo\\, even mocking Rey's attempts to try and take him out\\, then suddenly Kylo takes him out with such ease\\, especially knowing that Kylo is so conflicted and there is an issue of trust? It just didn't seem right after the fact. Not to mention it just left a gaping hole. If this scene was at the end of the movie\\, it might have felt more real\\, but half way through? Not to mention no background on Snoke at all. Again\\, going to plot direction\\, since everyone was anxious about who Snoke was let's kill him quick and they won't see it coming. Nope I didn't see it coming\\, but I didn't feel too great about it necessarily. It would've been like if in Return of the Jedi the Emperor who we've heard about and seen images of\\, got off his ship arriving at the Death Star to have Vader bring Skywalker to him half way through the movie\\, then\\, suddenly\\, a TIE fighter falls on him and he's dead. Ummm\\, okay. At least Vader was Vader and wouldn't have issues with him being the bad one as a Leader\\, but would still be thinking what just happened. Again\\, going back to plot direction\\, seems Snoke was killed off deliberately to go against what anyone was expecting for the sake of surprise so nobody could guess it\\, but without thinking of the consquences of it.\\n\\n3) Finally\\, some timing of humour was off putting. I'll only go into 2 examples that put me off a bit. One slightly\\, and the other more.\\n\\nFirst one is with Luke getting his blue milk or whatever on Ach-To with whatever creature it was. I understand and appreciate this was a throw back to the original New Hope\\, but I didn't see the need to watch Luke milk any creature\\, either using the force or not. Slightly off putting.\\n\\nSecond one which put me off more\\, only because of the importance of the return of the character was the beloved Yoda. When Yoda returned\\, his wacky scene of waving his finger to conjure lightening and burn the tree down then wiggling his feet while giggling made me think what is going on here. Not to mention he is a force ghost and now has the ability to influence physical reality. I get that this is also a direction to show perhaps how the force is changing\\, but then maybe don't have Yoda\\, who we've all been waiting for\\, lay back and wiggle his feet giggling at what he just did. I seriously didn't know what to make of that. I was expecting that Yoda would be having a real serious deep conversation with Luke on how the force is changing and what is old is passing with his humble wisdom\\, with maybe a line of humour to show he's still Yoda. But not what appeared to be a drunk Yoda lighting trees on fire and burning them to the ground using real lightening.\\n\\nAn example of good humour\\, the scene with Chewbacca attempting to eat the BBQ Porg while the other Porg are watching was funny. I liked the Porg\\, I felt they were used in decent amounts and right times to add some lightness to the movie when needed.\\n\\nThere are other items for the movie I might have been hoping for more of but I'm satisfied with what was done. Example of that is with Luke himself. I would've liked to see Luke as demonstrating his force capabilities a little more. His projection at the end I thought was good. I didn't see it coming\\, but it was also a good didn't see it coming vs bad. That being said\\, maybe if on Ach-To Luke did fight the Knights of Ren as an example\\, that would've added an additional touch fully satisfying Luke's capabilities\\, even if he still refused to go and help out\\, but then used his projection in the end. A little more Luke being bad ass with his powers would've been an improvement. But\\, I'm okay with what was done.\\n\\nThere are still some items I still don't know what to think of. One example is Leia using the force in space to return to the ship that is being referred to as the \\\"Superman\\\" moment referencing Batman vs Superman. I don't know yet what to make of this as again\\, its an attempt to demonstrate the direction of how the force is expanding to something different and Leia has it. I don't know what to make of it but not opposed to it. Afterall\\, in the pre-quels Senator Palpatine did tell Anakin about Darth Plagueis who found a way to cheat death with the force. Perhaps our limited on-screen exposure to just lightsabers\\, moving things around\\, mind control\\, and shooting lightening from fingertips has boxed us in to what the force really is and can be. However\\, Darth Plagueis trained daily\\, whereas\\, it doesn't appear Leia really has trained at all.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\, I liked the movie as I'm a fan and I thought there were some very good moments\\, in particular\\, for scenes with the late Carrie Fisher. Specifically between her and Mark near the end when he was projecting. Very touching moment to see them side by side\\, reminded me of their scene together in Return of the Jedi on Endor\\, when Luke told her the force was strong in his family leading to her being his sister.\\n\\nEven with these moments\\, there are some legitimate objections and frustrations with the movie if you're a fan. My wife went with me and she's not that into Star Wars. She liked it. However\\, she was also leaning in to me at times asking who's that guy (referring to Snoke)\\, which I replied \\\"I have no idea.\\\"\\, or how are they able to do that\\, which I replied \\\"I don't know.\\\"\\, or why are they doing that\\, which I replied \\\"I'm not sure.\\\". But she did like it.\\n\\nI'm not a diehard Star Wars fan that can never be pleased either. I'm just a fan that's being fair and objective.","true":true}
