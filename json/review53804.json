Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Half a star is generous. I saw the Last Jedi. Disney and Rain Johnson delivered another poorly written super hero movie with a Star Wars sticker slapped on it to sell seats. The Last Jedi is in a galaxy far far away from what Star Wars brand truly is about.\\n\\nThis is a Disneyfied story with CGI cows and cute\\, cuddly and useless graphics. The humor was forced\\, over used and predictable. Suddenly Leia is a super hero flying through the vacuum of space.  She had never been this strong with the force until now. If she was this strong with the force then Snoke should have been crushed by the wonder twins Luke & Leia long ago.\\n\\nAll characters are underdeveloped and quick shots of amulets are supposed to be the only background information we need to understand a character. Fin\\, Rose and Captain Phasma must have force\\, too. They are all hit by a blast and survive but the Stormtroopers around them are all dead.\\n\\nKylo Ren (emo Venom) and Rey (Merry Jane Watson) try to show an emotional connection but neither will yield and become a power couple. Preserving Star Wars IX. Completely Disney now with the corporation leveraging the theaters and taking a larger cut like the Master Codebreaker.\\n\\nI loved Star Wars but I may not be able to stomach it after the Last Jedi Disney and Rain Gave me.","true":true}
