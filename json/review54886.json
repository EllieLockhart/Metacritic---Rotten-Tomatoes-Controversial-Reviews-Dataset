Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's bad that I have to give this a half a star to leave a review. The story is probably the worst part. It takes place over only a few hours and feels forced. Random political agendas appear for no reason (for example\\, animal rights and \\\"shame on you for having money\\\" messages in a casino). Luke Skywalker is like a character you never knew and is extremely unlikable. I've probably already said too much\\, so I'll just let you go watch it for yourself. Very dissapointed","true":true}
