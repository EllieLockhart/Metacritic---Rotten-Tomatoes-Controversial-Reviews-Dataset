Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dissapointing\\, Seems to have been produced and directed by a committee.  Didn't take the risks of Rogue One and doesn't deserve a spot in the top 4 films of the franchise.  Dialogue and scenes were very heavy handed at times felt like I was sitting thru a philosophy course.","true":true}
