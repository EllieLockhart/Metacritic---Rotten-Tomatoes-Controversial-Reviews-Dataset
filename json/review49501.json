Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, a Star Wars movie that actually passes the Bechdel test! Combined with Carrie Fisher\u2019s moving performance (all the more because of a life that was filled with reasons not to put one\u2019s faith in hope)\\, a retort to the typical Star Wars obsession with cocky hotheaded men\\, and a more nuanced meditation on the dual presence of light and dark in us all: by far my favorite Star Wars.
