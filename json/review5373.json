Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"de principio a fin de la pelicula disney nos esta diciendo que dejemos el pasado \\, asi que a los fans no nos gustara esta pelicula\\, pero a nuevas generaciones les agradara mucho\\,","true":false}
