Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As I was leaving the cinema I felt nothing but disappointment and confusion.\\n\\nWhat's the point? What was the point of Snoke? Or Phasma? Of all the mystery behind the First Jedi? Why some characters say and do such a stupid things?\\n\\nNothing makes sense with this movie. It feels like it was redone just to suit Disney's agenda. I refuse to believe that any movie director could screw this up so badly on his own (yeah\\, even Lucas).","true":true}
