{"101487":161336,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Overall I thought it was an ok movie and they really meant \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\". My problems with The Last Jedi are how all these characters are set up in The Force Awakens and Rian Johnson disregards certain things that were set up. Snoke the new villain supposedly more powerful than Palpatine\\, and he is killed like nothing. Captain Phasma returns after being dealt with poorly in Episode 7 only to suffer the same fate. Luke returns just to be killed off as well. I can live with that because he will most likely return as a force ghost. What happened to the Knights of Ren and Rey's Flashback? And her parents are revealed to be nobodys when it was overhyped that this movie would be on Empire level of plot twists. It's as if Johnson didn't even watch 7. I thought the scenes with Leia were very well done and having Yoda again was great. Hopefully JJ Abrams fixes the inconsistencies in Episode 9.","true":true}
