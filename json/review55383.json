Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the movie. These haters out there are ridiculous. It was great to see Star Wars not follow the same direction as The Force Awakens. By the way\\, these haters hated on that movie because it was the same as the original Star Wars. Sure this movie has the same issues that all movies suffer from in underdeveloped characters and scenes\\, but in general it was fun and it was a great seconds showing off all the new characters that young people love. If you're older don't hate this Star Wars because it takes a new direction. Welcome the fact that we are not watching a remade Empire Strikes Back. That was the best Star Wars ever\\, but we didn't need to watch it again. I really liked the different direction on Star Wars because it sets itself apart now from the original trilogy. Now were charting a new path in the Star Wars universe and it's truly exciting. The old characters can't live forever and this series was never about them. It was always about giving them a welcome goodbye.","true":true}
