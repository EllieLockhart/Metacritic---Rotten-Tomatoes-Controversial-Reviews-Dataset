Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The best part about seeing this movie was the comfortable recliner chair and the big bag of skittles. It was entertaining as a tv movie but severely disappointing as a movie that I had to pay for. It was clear that the makers of this movie never bothered to watch any of the previous movies. The characters were inconsistent vs their known personas. I'll just list my biggest disappointments: Snoke went out like a chump. Why even bother making him so mysterious. I was looking forward to the Luke and Rey scene; what a let down. Mary Poppins. I can't even... I had my WTF face during and after that scene.","true":true}
