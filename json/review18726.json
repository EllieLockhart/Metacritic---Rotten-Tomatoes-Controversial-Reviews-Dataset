Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a fair movie but plenty of WTF moments.  There were entire scenes with dialog taken from Empire and Jedi. For a movie hailed for it's ground breaking uniqueness\\,  I don't see it.  Rogue One is a far better movie in all respects. I would recommend seeing the movie just know that it isn't as awesome as the critics would have you believe.","true":true}
