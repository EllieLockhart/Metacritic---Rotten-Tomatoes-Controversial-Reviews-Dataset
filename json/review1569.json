Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long Star Wars fan\\, I was incredibly pleased with this film. It did have some pacing issues but otherwise it is an excellent continuation of the story. I love that it upends predictions and expectations. I love the theme of letting go of the past\\, the fallibility of heroes\\, and the drawbacks of legend or mythos. The score is beautiful.","true":true}
