Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While this film is not perfect\\, it adds some amazing character development\\, great themes\\, surprising twists\\, and some great \\\"Star-Wars\\\" moments that will go down in history as some of the best.","true":true}
