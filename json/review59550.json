Not much to talk about.\r\rGameplay 9.5\/10\rIt is certainly improved since the first chapter. I really enjoyed variety and freedom vs human groups and authenticity vs infected. Locations were well designed and could be replayed with different styles. Shooting feeling and reactions are so good that I want to play again at a harder difficulty. Rope mechanics are awesome but could've been used more\\, with more variety in puzzles.\r\rI could criticise that the start & finish to combat sequences are too certain. There's not much surprise encounters when looting etc. Game is like now it's fighting part and we shoot them and our characters says literally oh we killed all the guys and now it's looting part. It could be better if we were on the alarm all the time reflecting the environment. Not much a downside but yeah..\r\rStory & Writing 8\/10\rI must say I didn't see any spoilers beforehand except the critical one at the beginning. When I finished the game\\, I was satisfied with my feelings and the journey I have been through.\r\rIt slows down at times\\, feels too stretched. It lacks some quality and I must admit that it's somewhat disappointing. I'm not talking about like all the angry fans about creative decisions by writers\\, this is their story. They've chosen a story to tell and I liked it\\, just not as good as I expected.\r\rThere could be other ways to continue our beloved duo's journey and it would be more appealing for the fans. They have chosen a a bold approach and I respect that.\r\rBTW\\, there's not much SJW thing to worry about. The things there are only adds to the story in a good way.\r\rOverall\\, this is definitely one of the best games of this generation and a MUST PLAY for all the gamers.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
