Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly one of the best Star Wars films. \\nTaking the franchise forward\\, with very interesting dark themes about failure\\, war and death\\, but also giving us the hope we need for a better future.\\nRemarkable work. \\nCan't wait for the sequel\\, and the Director's new trilogy.","true":true}
