Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have never seen a Star Wars movie previously this is an Okay Sci-Fi\/Action movie. But If you have seen the previos 6 Star wars movies. ( Not counting the joke that the force awaken was) you will realise that this movie lacks of the essence of the first 3 movies\\, where the adventures weren't presumptous and were actually fun to watch\\, or the sense of epicness of the 2nd trilogy\\, with spectacular sword fights and great action scenes ( Kylo Ren disapooints once again\\, but the joke that snoke has been is just an insult). Star wars movies have never been perfect\\, but at least they tried\\, this is just movies about how to make more movies\\, that are predictable and disapointing at the same time.","true":true}
