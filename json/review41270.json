Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a complete disservice to all the fans of the original series. It changes some of the original characters so much\\, they are not they same versions of themselves from the original trilogy. This movie also commits the greatest sin a Star Wars movie can make: it is clearly evident what time period this movie was made in\\, not by it's special effects\\, but by the contemporary issues this movie clumsily tackles. Because of this I highly doubt this trilogy will stand the test of time like the original one.","true":true}
