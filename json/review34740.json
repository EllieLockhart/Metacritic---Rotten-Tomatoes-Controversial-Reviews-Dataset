Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The death of the franchise has come in the second installment of the third trilogy. This will always be remembered as the point where they went off the rails and thumbed their noses at all of the long time star wars fans. The future of star wars will look nothing like you hoped it would. Welcome to the mickey mouse club with space magic everyone.","true":true}
