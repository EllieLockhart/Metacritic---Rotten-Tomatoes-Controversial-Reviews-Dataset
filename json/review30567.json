Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Signed up for rotten tomatoes just so i could rate this movie half a star. Luke was a brave character and now hes living in exile and won't help. Rey is just a commoner\\, nothing interesting\\, Snokes character is pointless\\, the whole sub plot with Finn and Rose is boring and a waste of time\\, they ruined the known way that the force works. I could go on and on but i am extremely disappointed.","true":true}
