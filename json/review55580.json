Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as bad as the prequels\\, by any means...but I left the theater not full of hope and optimism about the future of Star Wars\\, but saddened\\, disappointed and frankly...hurt. I have a hard time believing that anyone could feel good about how Rian Johnson used Luke in this story. I can't imagine that anyone feels that Rey\\, a blank canvas and \\\"just add water\\\" Jedi with almost no character development\\, is a fitting heir to the legacy of Luke Skywalker. Luke EARNED his place in popular culture\\, an entire generation (or two) believed in him\\, rooted for him and identified with him. When he succeeded\\, we cheered...because we felt like we knew him. We saw him grow\\, we felt his struggles. Can ANYONE truly say that they feel anything even remotely like that\\, with Rey? I seriously doubt it. She's the least interesting character in the films\\, and the most under-developed. But that's what they've hung the franchise on\\, and thus the Skywalker saga fizzles out under Rian Johnson's guidance.\\n\\nNo doubt\\, it's a well-made film and I like a lot about it. There are even parts with Luke that remind me of who he ACTUALLY is...but not enough. Not remotely enough. Luke deserved a whole lot better than this and so did all of us who have gone on his journey with him\\, and care about him.","true":true}
