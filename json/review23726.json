Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"lUKE'S CHARACTER WAS DISRESPECTED\\, SPAT ON AND KILLED OFF. NEW USELES SJW CHARACTERS. REY AN INCREDIBLY BORING HEROINE. THE STORY MOVES SLOWLY. LIKE THE FIRST DISNEY STARWARS COPIED A LOT FROM THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS - THIS MOVIE COPIES A LOT FROM THE eMPIRE STRIKES BACK... ALL THE WALKERS FROM HOTH ARE BACK\\, ETC. I HATED THIS MOVIE.
