Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Truly an underwhelming pile of schlock. It's a hackney\\, shit storm full of wannabe pious Disney do goodisms. \\n\\nThe only thing hitting in this film is the interaction between Rey and Kylo\\, which is the only thing capable of turning Rey into an animated\\, depth filled character.","true":true}
