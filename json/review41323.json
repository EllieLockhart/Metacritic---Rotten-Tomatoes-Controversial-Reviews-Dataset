Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a hot mess. Very pretty. No point. Some interesting scenes which are uncommon and hard to find. Movie is way too long. The space battles were horrible. They looked good but made no sense. Practically every scene was full of Deus ex Machina. Lea suddenly gets force powers. The most interesting character... the rogue... basically had no scenes and was not pivotal to the plot.\\n\\nI could go on. This movie title might turn out to mean more than the creators intended. This could be the end of the franchise. It was HORRIBLE.\\n\\nAnd let me be very clear here. It is not the fault of the actors\\, the set designers\\, the 3d graphics people... this is entirely on the Director and Writer.\\n\\nWhat were you thinking with this script?
