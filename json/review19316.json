Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not the Star Wars I wanted but it's the Star Wars we needed. Beautifully shot and full of surprises you may feel conflicted but you won't be disappointed.","true":true}
