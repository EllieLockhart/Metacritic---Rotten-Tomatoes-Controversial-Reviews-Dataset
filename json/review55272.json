{"101487":149371,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi or Return of the Phantom Menace? (SPOILERS)  As a fan since childhood and a fan of The Force Awakens this was a GIANT disappointment. Waiting 2 years to see what happens between Luke and Rey on the island...he throws the lightsaber away and locks himself in his room. What a let down...Reys parents... let down...Finn's reason for leaving the First Order not even mentioned.....reunion between Rey and Finn after all they went through...awkward hug...Snokes back story not mentioned....2 hour space battle where the entire First Order shoots a shield till they run out of gas WE GOT THAT! WTF!?!? The worst part\\, Luke thinking about killing his student and nephew because he felt the darkside in him...NO\\, no no! I know people say it was only a quick thought he had\\, he ignited his saber over a sleeping boy!! Sick\\, disgusting and completely destroys Luke as we thought we knew him. Leia the flying Nun and then the incredible hulk wtf was that? Lukes final scene...awful...if I knew that was going to be it for him then I could have cared but he's looking out to the sun then he's gone...the great Luke Skywalker died alone after a fake holo-battle...So Luke screwed up and lost Ben so he gives up on him and dies...does not go to him and try to help him\\, sacrifice himself to help him..nope...just dies...alone...wow...what a piece of trash.","true":true}
