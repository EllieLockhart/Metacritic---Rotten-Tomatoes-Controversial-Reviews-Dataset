Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good flick. There were a few things I didn't like\\, but overall it was very enjoyable. I was glad to see them take the franchise in a different direction.\\n\\n I've been a fan of the Star Wars extended universe since  the Timothy Zahn novels in the early 90s. It's safe to say that I'm a mega fan. But I get why Disney wanted to wipe that out so they could start fresh. Unfortunately\\, many fans can't understand that which is the reason there is a vocal minority of people who hate this movie. But Star Wars needed to evolve. Heros don't stay heros forever.","true":true}
