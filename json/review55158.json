Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went in the cinema genuinely expecting a disappointing movie\\, based on all the backlash I heard and read about\\, but left feeling completely satisfied and pleasantly surprised by it. I love it\\, and I am not ashamed to say I did. Sure\\, it didn't turn out to be what majority expected and wanted\\, but that's just it- sometimes future turns out not to be what we want or how it seemed it would turn out to be. And sometimes we are holding too tightly to past\\, expectations and beliefs. Maybe you're looking too much at the horizon\\, or maybe you're still fighting the battles of the past\\, all over again to realize how great the movie was\\, not because of plot holes\\, unnecessary humor or a bit too long filler scenes\\, which all Star Wars movies have; but because it chooses not to be black and white like before\\, instead completely gray\\, completely human\\, simple and magnificent\\, and focusing more on the core centers\\, the force and the characters. So yes\\, there are things I didn't like\\, such as Leia's space flying thingy and unnecessary jokes\\, and I didn't care at all about Fin and Rose first half of the movie\\, but at the end\\, all that I liked is much stronger than what I didn't.","true":true}
