Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Its funny\\, with action and a bit of an unwanted mid quest to get the hacker though but all in all it was enjoyable. The new ways of using the force\\, the way snoke was killed was a bit anti climactic but it showed how arrogance can kill even the most powerful of Sith or Jedi. New ways of using the force\\, Force Projection too was awesome. I really thought that Luke had joined the fray and was really powerful. Cant wait for the last movie to see where all this building up leads to. I would have given it a 5\/5 but the only blemish I see is the long winding and unnecessary trip to get the hacker.","true":true}
