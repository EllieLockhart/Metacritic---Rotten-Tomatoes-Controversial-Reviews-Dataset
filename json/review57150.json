Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst star wars movie ever. It's so incredibly cheesy and filled with black hole sized subplots. In fact many of the subplots from the Force Awakens are just dropped entirely. There are just so many bad things happening in this movie I cannot number them all\\, but certainly the most cringe worthy one is when Poe drops to his knees to give his droid a belly rub... Jar Jar Binks come back we forgive you!","true":true}
