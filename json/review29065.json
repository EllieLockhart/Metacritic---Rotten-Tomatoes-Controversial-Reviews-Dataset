Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really liked the movie. Couple of comments though. Kylo Ren is basically a conflicted spoiled brat in a 2010s indie romantic flick. What a waste of Benicio del Toro in that disgraceful casino scene. Yeah\\, we get it\\, the universe is filled with scoundrels. At least we got to love the scoundrel we encountered in the first trilogy. Kylo Ren should've been portrayed by Iwan Rheon. Period.","true":true}
