Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really bad Luke\/Ray dialogue\\, turning Poe into an unsympathetic heel\\, the Deus ex codemaster\\, poorly timed and out-of-character humor ... So much sloppy stuff in this film. Also\\, while I have no problem with Rose or the actress who played her (her character was one of the better comedic deliverers)\\,  the Finn\/Ray chemistry which made the previous movie fun is totally gone here. It's a necessary part of the cannon to watch this\\, but it's not one I'll be watching again\\, which is disappointing after force awakens and rogue one.","true":true}
