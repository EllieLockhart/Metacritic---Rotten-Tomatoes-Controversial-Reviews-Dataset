Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good bye Star Wars. I've loved this series my whole life and after this one I'm done. I will no longer give Disney one more dime to watch them rid themselves of characters I've gone my whole life loving just to make way for a new generation. They made Luke go from a man that loved family and had hope of redemption to a man of dispare that in the end has no hope of redemption for a loved one. Rian Johnson you've ruined Star Wars for an avid fan. So this will be my last dime spent to ruin a great movie series. With so many books and stories to pull a good narrative from why would you make such a pile of garbage movie? It was mind boggling. ","true":true}
