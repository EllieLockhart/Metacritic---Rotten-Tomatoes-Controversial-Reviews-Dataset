Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After Disney took away all of the canon from the Star Wars universe\\, I really am disappointed that they aren't giving much back. The movie was barely watchable\\, and sorely lacking in anything satisfying to fill the giant void that they made when they took away all of the extended universe.","true":true}
