Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If I had never seen Star Wars then I would have thought it to be a pretty good sci fi film that I would never quite understand. The visual fx were gorgeous. However\\, as a Star Wars fan and a follower of the Skywalker saga and greatest Jedi to ever have lived... I was left totally dead and bewildered.  I also failed to understand how the film failed to convert the awesome setups from The Force Awakens. More than a trick has been missed. Tbh I was utterly dissapionted... but as a sci fi fan I thought it was ok.","true":true}
