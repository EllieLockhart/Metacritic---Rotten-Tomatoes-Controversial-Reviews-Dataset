Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sad that people are making multiple accounts to down vote this film. Rian Johnson gives a very unique take to the Star Wars franchise. While I do believe the film has some problems\\, Johnson gives us some of the most memorable Star Wars moments ever and that is coming from a die-hard Star Wars fan. Johnson made a lot of bold decisions and while not all of them paid off a lot of them did. The cast was fantastic and the standouts are Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who both give their greatest performances as two of the most iconic characters in history. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are the other two I thought did a fantastic job. This is another great addition to the Star Wars franchise and can't wait to see what JJ will bring us with episode IX as well as what Rian Johnson will be doing with his new trilogy. ","true":true}
