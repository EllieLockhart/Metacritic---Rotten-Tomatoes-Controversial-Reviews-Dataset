Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow\\, what a missed opportunity. So many characters are either wasted or act out of character\\, there's plots that go nowhere and many\\, many inconsistencies with the established lore. What were they thinking? I'm not a hardcore fan but I've generally enjoyed this universe - I am now officially out. Good work Disney.","true":true}
