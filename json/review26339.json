Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not the worst SW movie ever\\, but easily the most damaging to the lore. I didnt have a problem with the risks as far as killing Snoke and Luke\\, but Rian Johnson did a character assasination on Luke rendering the Original Trilogy almost meaningless and almost depressing. And for everyone calling Rey a Mary Sue that I argued with...my apologies. You were all 100 percent right.","true":true}
