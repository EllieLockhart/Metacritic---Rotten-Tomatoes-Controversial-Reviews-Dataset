Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can understand Mark Hamill's disappointment at Disney's treatment of Luke Skywalker .. so so bad; total cop out .. basically very little left of the original\\, well loved character .. I actually feel sorry for Hamill; damn shame that is .. no respect given for possibly the greatest cinematic hero ever created .. screw you Micky Mouse\\, ya rat !! \\n\\nThe most striking cinematic experience married to the most horrendous possible story arc .. what the hell will Eps IX bring ? \\n\\nMy childhood has gone up in the lamest of possible flame storms .. lol\\, i guess.\\n\\nThey went for something bold here and in the final analyses i believe Disney will have alienated a healthy margin of the fan base.","true":true}
