Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I heard Disney had purchased Star Wars some years ago\\, my heart sank. I knew they would trash it. They have exceeded my expectations with this latest steaming pile of cinematic diarrhea. I did not think The Force Awakens was a good film\\, but hoped that maybe\\, just maybe\\, it was just a stumbling before Disney did the series justice. The Last Jedi proves they have no respect (or understanding) for Star Wars and will keep cranking out these dreadful sequels until idiot fanboys\/girls stop paying\\, which by the looks of many of these misguided reviews\\, will be never. I will never watch another Star Wars film again. Just wish I had adopted this stance prior to sitting through this horrendous farce. \\nThis movie is so bad\\, it makes the Prequels look good.","true":true}
