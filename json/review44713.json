Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Trash amateur fan fiction (maybe?) somehow turned into a champ for diversity?  It's a bad movie no matter how you break it down.  Cheap plot device and lazy story telling covered up by ok-ish CGI...  Skip this and just re-watch the original trilogy.","true":true}
