Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has ruined Star Wars.  I really like the new characters created by JJ Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan\\, but I feel that Rian Jonhson has weakened the new characters\\, the old characters and the story. Mark Hamill was right to say he disagreed with his character\\, as it was so out of character.  Critics say it was fresh\\, but to me it felt like Star Wars has been put through a cheese grater and made into a bad sandwich.","true":true}
