Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The highs are impeccable - some of the best scenes in all of Star Wars canon. Yet the lows undermine not only seemingly important story beats from The Force Awakens\\, but questions the whole mythology upon which Star Wars is built.","true":true}
