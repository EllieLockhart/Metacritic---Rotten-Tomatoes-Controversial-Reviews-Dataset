Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wasted storyline\\, unfaithful to the original saga. Way too much use of an epic saga as propaganda for multiculturalism and maybe feminism at the expense of the storyline. Beautiful movie when put on mute. Saturated movie leaving no air for imagination. Apparent fake criticism boosting\\, cheating.","true":true}
