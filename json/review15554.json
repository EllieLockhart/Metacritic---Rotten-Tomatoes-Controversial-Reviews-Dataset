Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved TFA and was so excited to see The Last Jedi. I really believed in Rian Johnson and genuinely expected him to deliver an amazing movie. Got that wrong didn't I?!!\\nWhat an insult to Star Wars fans. Was this director making some kind of weird joke? A three year old could have written a better plot than this face palm inducing nightmare. Every section of the movie falls apart under even a glancing scrutiny. The effects and sound are impressive\\, but the story telling is painfully awful. For something so impportant to so many people and a money making machine so lucrative to Disney\\, how exactly does this happen!!?!?! What for the love of god went wrong with the creation of this movie? I'm out. No more Star Wars for me.","true":true}
