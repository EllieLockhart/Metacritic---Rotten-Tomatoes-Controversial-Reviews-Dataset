Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disgusting that this is even a Star Wars movie. This movie turned the franchise into a slow rollercoaster The Force Awakens gave it the suspense but The Last Jedi was the slow and unexciting fall. It spat in the face of not just TFA but the entire Star Wars mythology. No character arcs\\, boring characters and toxic feminism all combined to make this gross mess of a movie. It never answered any questions with we had in the first movie and just seemed like a painstakingly long waste of time.","true":true}
