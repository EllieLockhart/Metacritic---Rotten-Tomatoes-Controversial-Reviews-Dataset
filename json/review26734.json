Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"old fashion movie....desney keeps generating \\\"princesses movie\\\". really NOT star wars....don't waste your money... my score is 0.5 out of 10. To be honest\\, the score can be even lower.... probably 0 is the correct one...   why don't we have negative score system for desney junk movies??","true":true}
