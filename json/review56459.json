Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The ending of The Force Awakens was so powerful.  It builds on so much.  Rey finds this long sought after map of Skywalker's location.  She\\, Chewie and R2 embark on a far-fetched quest to find him.  Arrives at Ahch-To\\, her expression clearly states nervousness\\, but confidence that she senses Luke.  They land\\, she embarks from the Falcon\\, hikes up a mountain\\, passing old ruins and dwellings.  As she arrives at the top of the mountain\\, there's a clearing....There\\, at the top of the clearing\\, stands a lone man\\, as if he was expecting her. The figure\\, facing the ocean\\, even after seeing the Falcon fly in\\, is motionless\\, confidant.\\n\\n**music building to emphasize the dramatic moment the audience is watching**\\n\\nHere you have an novice finding the lost and last \\\"wizard\\\".  Her eyes swell in disbelief\\, there he was... he slowly turns\\, and lifts his hood. Despair\\, sadness and wisdom in his face\\, eyes and stature..... the man stares at his past\\,  you can feel the pain and power in his response to what that lightsaber means\\, he thinks\\, \\\"I foresaw this\\, now is the time\\, she's here.\\\"\\n\\nBeyond amazing.  I had chills in theaters.... then Rian steps in.............\\n\\n---- Spoilers ----\\n\\nCut to The Last Jedi:\\n\\nThrows saber over shoulder and walks away comically.\\n\\nTotally doesn't work.  Rian Johnson lost a masterfully crafted moment in Star Wars cannon...  such a damn shame.?  He really threw out everything setup in The Force Awakens.  I'm beyond disappointed.","true":true}
