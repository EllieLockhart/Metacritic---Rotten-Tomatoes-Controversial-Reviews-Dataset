Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't even use technology to their advantage...that's pretty much all you need to know. \\nSo I'm assuming snoke is a side character? It's sad to see a sigh lord that is supposed to be wise as stupid as jar jar binks. \\nBarney the dinosaur is more fearful than the first order\\,Thank you Kathleen Kennedy for your political agenda the one place we want to escape reality is at a theatre\\,why am I seeing every culture you can think of on the screen? Anything concerning WAR with too many women is laughable. Youre a disgrace to real women...the women that are gifted in the brain not physicality. \\nNow imagine me swearing...that's something my gf is about to absorb. \\n\\nNot watching anything till the next trilogy. \\n\\nO and the worst part is Roman reigns I mean rey 0 training lesion with a saber 1 training with the mind and everything else is as easy as taking a dumb on Iran Johnson's desk.
