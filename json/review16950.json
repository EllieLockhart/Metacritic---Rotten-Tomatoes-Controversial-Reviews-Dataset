Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I personally loved this movie and the cinematography is stunning. I'm loving the dynamic between Kylo and Rey and super excited about where they will go in episode 9","true":true}
