Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hope Disney reads this: \\n\\n- The script felt as if dictated by commercial interests \\nregarding next episodes\\, potential spin offs etc. It also felt as if there was no confidence in it\\, and was reworked a hundred times to a point of nonsense. \\n\\n- 57% audience approval in reality is much lower. I went out of the cinema and everyone seemed disappointed. Many people think they liked it because they were influenced by early reviews. \\n\\n- When Luke says \\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\"\\, I was bracing for massive impactful moments. But all felt safe and self aware and calculated... in Star Wars movies there are moments I sometimes cry... here the feelings felt forced. It's the first Star Wars movie I don't feel like rewatching. \\n\\n-Why not Christopher Nolan or Spielberg to direct? Why these directors with previous movies that I find so uninspired? I didn't find TFA bad at all\\, and I consider Rogue One very good\\, especially its last few minutes.\\n\\n-Huge waste of the potentiality for cinematic drama in the mishandling of Luke... What ? He didn't even bother to go and fight ( I don't care that it made sense)??? And died anyway? Wow... thanks Rian.\\n\\n-","true":true}
