Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes everywhere\\, I was hoping that the next one would be better than the first. If there were not six movies before this it MIGHT have been good. George Lucas is sitting back counting his money and laughing. Disney needs to hire some of the YouTube channels to fact check every plot hole and Capt Phasma under utilized\\, Rey\u2019s parents were nobody\\, Snoke looked so powerful but weak\\, Luke\u2019s part was lame.
