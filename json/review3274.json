Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Because there is time to talk about mistreatment of animals but not Snoke's backstory\\, and Rose and so much more that I don't want to go into. The prequels had serious problems but this movie is easily the most garbage thing in the Star Wars universe up to now. Can't wait for that new trilogy Rian!!","true":true}
