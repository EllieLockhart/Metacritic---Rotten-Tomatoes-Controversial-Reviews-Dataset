Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a confusing\\, semi-prequelesque\\, weird movie\\, whose \\\"plot twists\\\" weren't really twists but attempts at satisfying an audience that wants \\\"plot twists\\\"  The humor wasn't bad\\, but over used and conscious of itself (a few jokes is okay\\, but after a while become annoying.)  But not a single character escapes being ruined by this story\\, which makes me now not care about their story or this trilogy.  And surprisingly\\, the special effects were mediocre\\, and moving away from \\\"practical\\\" effects to the usual bad CGI seen in almost every blockbuster. No where near as good as any of the real \\\"original\\\" Star Wars\\, so whomever paid for the positive reviews prior to the movie must have shelled out a hefty sum.","true":true}
