Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Humor was terrible and in places where it shouldn't have been. Way too many plot holes and lack of caring about the background of characters. Made it so Rey has no Jedi background so that Disney can keep milking the shit out of the Star Wars franchise more than Luke milked those space cows. Oh\\, and if you like Capitalism\\, the Casino scene pretty much shits on that too. Disney\\, please make a Star Wars movie that cares more about creating a background for several characters than creating a story that tells more about anti-capitalism and SJW ideals.","true":true}
