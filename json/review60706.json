The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The game is beautiful\\, gameplay is good\\, accessibility options are AMAZINGthe story is the single worst thing I have ever experienced. The characters are all over the place and their development from the first game is undone. Some of their actions make no sense and their characters are destroyed[ spoilers]you play half the game as a character they try to shove down your throat that is not likeable at all. That story drags on and no matter what they throw at you. You do not feel for her. She is unlike able. And not fun to play as. Her story takes forever and the entire time you\u2019re thinking \u201cwhen will I play as Ellie again\u201d becuase you do not care about Abby at all even though that\u2019s what the game wants. It\u2019s insane that they give you 10 hours of sob story and it still does not make you like her. You also have to fight against Ellie as her at one point. And it basically makes you want to stop playing the game. You should not be rooting for a character you play as to die\\,Not to mention the story is so out of order and all over the place. You play in a flashback and then play a flashback in that flashback and so on. Not to mention joel dies in the very beginning of the game and in the marketing they changed models to make you think he was in the game more which is straight up lies. Abby\\, the character they make you play as not only kills Joel but TORTURES him to death. And never feels any remorse for it\\, yet we\u2019re supposed to sypathize with her because she has a cute dog? She tortures prisoners in cages brutally and at one point just turns her back on the people she once considered HER people\/family with literally no remorse. When she goes to kill Dina\\, Ellie says wait no she\u2019s pregnant\\, Abby says \u201cgood\u201d how are we ever supposed to relate\/like Abby unless you are a pyschopath like her. The pacing is also suuuuper offI think Dina and Ellie are a very cute couple\\, kind of awkward writing at times but overall good. Until the scene where Ellie reveals she is immune and then Dina randomly blurts out she is pregnant. Which is\\, not how conversations work. I\u2019m kind of disappointed as how the LGBT characters were written as an LGBT person myself. This could have been a big chance for us with a huge presence and representation in a big videogame like this. But everything fell apart and now I believe it\u2019s working against us rather than for us. It\u2019s almost like 7 different people were told to write a story for the game and they weren\u2019t allowed to talk to each other and then they mashed the ideas together.Overall. The story is very bad. There were many times where I just wanted the game to be over already\u2026 Expand","true":true}
