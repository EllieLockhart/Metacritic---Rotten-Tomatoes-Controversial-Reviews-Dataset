Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is an insult to the name of Star Wars. It destroys the lore set by it's earlier entries\\, plods along a single-track story slower than frozen molasses going up-hill on a cold winter day\\, and is filled with more plot holes than your average slice of Swiss cheese. Half of the characters have little-to-no motivation beyond \\\"stopping the First Order\\\" and constantly trying to one-up the other characters around them. Rey is an even bigger Mary Sue than in TFA\\, Kylo is the epitome of a whiny brat\\, Finn is stuck dealing with another character and sub-plot that both mean absolutely nothing to the larger context of the story\\, Poe is dealing with an SJW feminist lesbian who refuses to tell the crew of their ship her \\\"big plan\\\" while they all get killed just for the sake of making the men on board look like complete ass hats\\, and Luke is a hollow\\, soulless\\, crusty shell of the hero he once was in the original trilogy. In the name of trying to be politically correct and push modern social issues\\, the creators of this movie have annihilated everything about this universe that made it great.","true":true}
