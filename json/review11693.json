Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How bad is this movie? It is so bad on so many different levels that it is hard to put on words. It feels like the director intentionally tried to hurt all that is important to the series fans. I wish Disney apologizes for this mess.","true":true}
