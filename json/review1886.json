Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from ruining the Luke Skywalker character and the bizarre Leia in space scene\\, the film is decent. Overall the film suffers from lack of character development - likely because there are too many to keep track of. And a wide variety of scenes that are perfect for the Lego game but make no sense for the story.","true":true}
