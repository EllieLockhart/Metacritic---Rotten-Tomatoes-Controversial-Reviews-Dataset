Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie is dead pan mediocre\\, a complete filler of a movie where nothing really changes\\, the state of the starwars universe is fundamentally the same at the end as when it starts leaving you asking \\\"what was the point\\\".","true":true}
