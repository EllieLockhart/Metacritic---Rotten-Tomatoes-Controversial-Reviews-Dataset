Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't understand the weird vitriolic reaction by a certain chunk of the fanbase. This movie is everything I wanted from a 2nd part of the new trilogy. Trippy\\, cerebral\\, thought provoking\\, action packed\\, plus loads of light saber action. IDK\\, I don't get it.","true":true}
