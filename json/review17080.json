Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed the movie. I actually enjoyed the story more than the Force Awakens. The Force Awakens was the same damn story as the original Star Wars movies back in the 1970's.  This will be one of the first times i actually agree with critics. I will need to see it a second time\\, but i see no issues with it.","true":true}
