Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is terrible.  I wont even get into how much potential was wasted on the half-effort story line.  I miss when 1-2 characters were the comic relief of this Action\/Sci-fi adventure series.  Now\\, every character is a comedian.  With each scene change\\, I don't know what personality I am going to see from any given character....the comedian or the real character that attempts to drive the plot forward. Spoiler: Kylo Ren was a disaster.  Its sad\\, but this series is dead...its just like Transformers\\, just a whole lot of nothing with some explosions to make the brain dead go WOOOO and throw their money at it!!!","true":true}
