Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"****SPOILERS*****\\nThis movie just threw out most of what made the star wars franchise memorable and unique from the rest of the movie world. Rian Johnson seems to burn down all of the intriguing plot lines\\, character arcs\\, and mysterious figures just for the sake of being edgy and new. The awkward use of humor fell short at best and ruined otherwise intense scenes. Almost felt like a forced marvel movie in some cases. Hard to really care about most of the characters that are left\\, since those that I did care about were wasted without resolution to their arcs or backstories. The one scene where you felt like they had a chance to really bring home the emotions and deliver a big gut punch to the audience\\, was ruined by a last minute speeder cash followed by an awkward and forced kiss\\, again trying to deliver humor in what should have been the most serious of moments.\\n\\nOn a positive note\\, Adam Driver did a much better job with Kylo Ren this go around and Mark Hamill was great for the majority of the film.","true":true}
