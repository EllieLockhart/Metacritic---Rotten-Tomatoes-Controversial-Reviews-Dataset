Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Mostly hot garbage. Laura Dern reminded everyone why she's fallen off the face of the Earth. She can't act. Even if she could\\, her character was so badly thought out that I believe she may have been put in as an afterthought or to cover for re-shoots that could no longer be done with Carrie Fisher.\\n\\nFin's character should have come into his own\\, but instead he became more pathetic and downright unlikeable. I'm not sure if he can be saved in the next film\\, especially not if the completely pointless Rose character continues.\\n\\nHux continues to demonstrate no reason why he should have a job in the First Order\\, much less be the man in command. The throw-away Phasma wiped out even more than in the first film.\\n\\nPhasma\\, Dern and Rose all seemed to be in the film to up the number of female characters because none of them in anyway advanced the plot or made decisions that made even a modicum of sense.\\n\\nApparently nobody in the First Order can see. They have giant windows on their ships\\, but cannot see Fin and Rose leaving the Resistance mothership. Then when the Resistance launches the escape pods\\, nobody in the First Order can see that\\, either. Jamming sensors does not jam photons getting to your eyes.\\n\\nRey continues to be an expert in the Force with no explanation whatsoever. It's gotten so bad that I'd welcome some midichloreans.\\n\\nThe most powerful Force user is apparently BB8\\, who can levitate himself hundreds of feet in the air to hijack an AT-ST.\\n\\nThere were flashes of greatness and a few wonderful ideas\\, but overall this film was trash.","true":true}
