Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest problem with this movie is that it didn\u00e2(TM)t feel like a Star Wars movie. I felt like it was a Marvel movie wearing a Star Wars costume. There\u00e2(TM)s a bunch of bad humor\\, the characters aren\u00e2(TM)t developed well\\, and I thought the plot was pretty dumb. Additionally\\, there\u00e2(TM)s a bunch of 2017 political themes forced into the film\\, which is something I don\u00e2(TM)t want to see in a galaxy far\\, far away. All in all\\, I had to watch it because it\u00e2(TM)s a Star Wars movie\\, but this movie will never merit a rewatch (which is something I never thought I\u00e2(TM)d say about a Star Wars movie)","true":true}
