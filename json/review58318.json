Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A completely shallow movie that follows the previous trend of rehashing the OT storyline. No new ideas give any impact\\, although some of them are cool\\, like the casino plotline or new jedi powers\\, they just don't feel StarWarsy. Nor does the cinematography. Slow motion anime moves and extreme closeups are not in the visual dictionary of SW. Lightsabers look fanmade\\, music is reused from Episode 7. Nothing about the world is revealed (who is Snoke\\, what happened in those 30 years inbetween) and everything is even more confusing (why is FO controlling half the galaxy now when it barely had one planet in TFA). More deaths without conclusion to the arc (if that arc ever existed). A movie that is not neither a good movie by itself nor a good introduction to the SW universe. Nor is there an excuse of playing safe this time. And the people agree with me (not the critics on Disney payroll though\\, they will bullshit you!) As of now the RT Audience Score is 56% and it is completely justified!\\nI recomend watching it when it's out on Blu Ray and reccomend PIRATING it. But if you want to see it on the big screen - don't go 3D or 48fps - there is no visual candy to justify it and you will get headache for no satisfying return. Although you will get it anyway.\\nRemember to VOTE WITH YOUR VALLET like you did with SWBF2!\\nP.S. Only waiting for Half in the Bag and Plinkett reviews now","true":true}
