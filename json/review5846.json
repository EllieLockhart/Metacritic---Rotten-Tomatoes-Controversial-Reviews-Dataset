Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed with the lack of respect for the character Luke\\, as well as the lack of respect for the viewer who wanted questions answered and a story that made sense this time around. That forced feminism in there is still easy to spot as well. As far as I'm concerned\\, Star Wars is officially dead.","true":true}
