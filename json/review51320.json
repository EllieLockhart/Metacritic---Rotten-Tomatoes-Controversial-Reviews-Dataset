Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible Star Wars entry. Even from a non-Star Wars perspective there are so many plot holes it may as well have been called swiss cheese. The humor is not even remotely funny and detracts from the movie itself. The \\\"twists\\\" are hardly twists and more of an unnecessary build up to a pointless 5 second dismissal. I understand now why Mark Hamill had a problem with the way Rian Johnson portrayed Luke Skywalker. The force is not with this movie.","true":true}
