Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm going to stay as spoiler free as possible\\, but I do want to comment on that a lot of views handwave over a lot of the criticism of this movie. They say \\\"You can't please every Star Wars fan\\\"\\, but the movie is bad from a technical standpoint. Bad writing\\, bad motives\\, bad implications (especially \\\"that scene\\\" which most people who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about)... and that's not even getting into the lazy script writing: \\\"flies through space\\\".","true":true}
