Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it. Yes there are a few parts they definitely should have left out. If you\u2019re a purist I could understand why you might take issue with the film. But if you love Star Wars and love being entertained this will not disappoint. ","true":true}
