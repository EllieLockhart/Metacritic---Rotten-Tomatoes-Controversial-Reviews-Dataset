Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Exhilarating\\, A Roller-coaster of emotions\\, there are enough twist and turns that will make you laugh\\, cry and an occasional \\\"What?!\\\" moment. Instantly belongs to the top 3 of SW universe.","true":true}
