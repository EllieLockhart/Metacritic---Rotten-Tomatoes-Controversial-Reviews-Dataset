Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the most detailed Star Wars movie I have ever watched. 3 storylines in one (Leia\\, Fin\\, & Rea)\\, Empire only had 2 (Luke & Leia). I didn\u2019t want what happen at the end to happen\\, but it was done tastefully. ","true":true}
