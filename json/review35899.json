Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the movie the Star Wars franchise needed. With excellent performances from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver\\, as well as generally everyone on the cast\\, the Last Jedi takes Star Wars as we know it and throws it at the spark that will light the First Order for the better. While at times the movie for me stops in its tracks until we get back to the good elements of the story\\, it refreshes the franchise to keep things interesting instead of what we have known Star Wars to be; predictable. Although change can generally result to the poor reviews the movie has gotten from fans\\, it is all for the better and allows the franchise to continue going strong.","true":true}
