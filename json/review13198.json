Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think I've ever done a review here\\, but I had to do this after I heard Disney was trying to spin the low score as being the work of trolls...\\nThis movie is hot garbage. Horrible story-telling\\, tons of social justice warrior lecturing\\, ugh. It is offensive on every level.\\n\\nI NEVER thought a Star Wars movie could be so bad that I'd rather watch Jar Jar\\, but this one is just that bad.\\n\\nI would recommend that you boycott the next film\\, but I don't think it's necessary. It's obvious to most fans that there is no reason to care what happens in IX. It doesn't matter who directs it or what they do with the \\\"story\\\" at this point. It won't be hard at all to ignore the next release. Lol. \\n\\n\\nWay to go\\, Ryan Johnson. Smh","true":true}
