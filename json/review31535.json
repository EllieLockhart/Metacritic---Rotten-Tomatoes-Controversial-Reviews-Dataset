Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much bad. Luke's character is totally different than the originals. Leia is different. Characters fall in love with each other after a short period of time together. The premise\\, of being low on fuel is just stupid and lazy writing if ever there was such a thing. So many convenient moments\\, so much plot armor. \\n\\nEveryone who went on and on about how all those JJ plot holes would be fixed in the next movie were proven wrong. This one doesn't fix any of those plot holes and instead makes us wonder why Disney thinks it can do to Star Wars what it's done to Marvel. Star Wars isn't something you can just crank out once a year and have fans be cool with it.","true":true}
