Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very strange film\\, somehow managing to feel entirely like filler despite some big developments. It doesn't really follow up on any of the plot threads from Force Awakens in any depthful or satisfying way\\, and doesn't leave much for the next film to follow up on. One of the main sub-plots ends up being entirely pointless\\, which is quite frustrating when it doesn't feel like enough time was given to the more interesting aspects of the storyline. I can see a lot of fans being upset at the handling of a particular character. Ultimately\\, it wasn't a very good story and I was baffled by a lot of the creative decisions in telling it.","true":true}
