Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian johnson couldnt have done a better job of ruining a trilogy in 2 hours. Absolutely loved the force awakens and everything it had set up. This film could have been so good and it should of been easy! All they had to do was follow on from the force awakens and discover the characters a bit more. Instead rian johnson just ripped up the whole star wars story by killing off the big characters who were massively built up in the force awakens without any answers. \\n\\nLuke skywalker is turned from been a galactic hero to a gutless hermit who doesnt give a damn about anyone. Old obi-one had balls of steel compared to this clown. \\n\\nNot only is it the worst star wars film by a country mile\\, but it is one of the worst films i have ever seen. The attempts at humour totally kill off important scenes and are laughable for all the wrong reasons. \\n\\n\\nAs for the final scene where the ship kamikazes into the first orders fleet wiping them all out. Im lost for words..\\nIts like they couldnt think of a way to finish the film and someone shouted this idea out from the back of the room without any thought and they went oooo that would be good. \\n\\nOverall half a star\\, pure disgrace.","true":true}
