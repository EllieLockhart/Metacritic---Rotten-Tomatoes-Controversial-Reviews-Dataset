Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson shook up the star wars UNIVERSE with this one and he did the right thing. This film broke the trend and formula that all star wars have come to know but A LOT of us SADLY to attached to.  with an exciting story that focuses more on the characters rather than the flashy aspect of the galaxy far far away\\, The last jedi has DEFINITELY setup for an exciting conclusion to the trilogy in EPISODE 9.","true":true}
