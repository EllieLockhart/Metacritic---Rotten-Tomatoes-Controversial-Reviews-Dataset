The critics on some story beats may be justified but for me felt so minor in the scope of the whole thing! I could connect to the main characters but you have to bring a ton of empathy and general interest for a story with consequences and unconventional pacing into it. (The pacing is actually the only thing I would have wished were different). Overall great experience which should not be missed. Even a week after finishing it my mind still comes back thinking about the events.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
