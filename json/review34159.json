Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thanks for spitting on the character of Luke Skywalker! It's fitting that Disney would continue to run over everything that was Star Wars! But hey\\, at least I don't have to watch anymore of this series. Don't care about Fin\\, Poe\\, Rey or Rosey!","true":true}
