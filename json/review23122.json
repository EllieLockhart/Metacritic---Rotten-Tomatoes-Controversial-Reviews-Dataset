Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it \\, can see why the die hard traditional star wars fans might not but you can only have so many death stars. If I had to moan then lia flying through space would be it.   This had strong female roles \\, good deaths for all concerned and that little \\\" did I see that right\\\" bit at the very end.","true":true}
