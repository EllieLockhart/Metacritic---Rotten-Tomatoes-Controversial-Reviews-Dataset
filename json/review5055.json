Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Created an account just to rate this movie....... How does someone who makes a great scifi movie like Looper\\, and have a company like Disney who can throw hundreds of millions at you\\, mess up Starwars. I just don't understand. Everything from the writing\\, to casting\\, to plot points\\, to pointless side missions\\, to basic lack of intelligence from the bad and the good. My God Rian Johnson dropped the ball on this one. Would give it 1 star\\, but it was a beautiful looking movie. Props to the special effects team. ","true":true}
