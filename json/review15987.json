Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made this RT account primarily for this very polarising movie. I don't care what you think of the movie. And the fact that the incredibly idiot SW fanbase wants to remove this incredibly well-made and hard worked project\\, beyond my comprehension. I personally really enjoyed the movie\\, and am very disappointed with the backlash the movie has received.","true":true}
