Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was trash.  Characters introduced were boring.  Snoke\\, on of the few interesting characters\\, was killed off without any chance to do anything almost like the writers had ADD and decided \\\"whoops\\, I'm bored with this guy lets kill him\\\". Still trying to figure out how Rey became a Jedi?? Why is she looking for a teacher...seems to be picking it up on her own without any training....or did the ADD writers just think that part was boring too so lets skip it and make her crush Sith Lords....  This movie was a hot pile of trash.  I'm not even going to finish giving my thoughts....you guys watched this train wreck.  Good Grief.","true":true}
