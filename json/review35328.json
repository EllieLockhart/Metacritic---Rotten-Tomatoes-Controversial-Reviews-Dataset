Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor was cringe-worthy\\, when Rey was sensing the force the visuals of constant cut always was remarkably horrible. Some of the visuals were good\\, but everything around the visuals felt like a rift on the Prequels. Hamill did his best with what he was given. But Skywalker was entirely out of character.","true":true}
