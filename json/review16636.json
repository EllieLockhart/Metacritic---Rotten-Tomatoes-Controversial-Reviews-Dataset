Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Incredibly detailed and well executed film. A great direction for the series; it subverts the expected 3 film arc and is utterly surprising. The messages are strong and ultimately hopeful. The action sequences are phenomenal as always and I'm looking forward to following these characters in the next episode.","true":true}
