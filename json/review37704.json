Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's so much wrong with this movie that I don't even know where to begin.  The pacing is terrible\\, the character development is terrible (you could delete the entire Finn + Rose scenes and it would have no impact on the rest of the film) and for a 2.5 hour film\\, it felt like a lot of nothing happened.  \\n\\nWorst of all\\, this didn't even feel like a Star Wars movie.  I feel like the creators of this and the last one are either rehashing old material from the previous films as a throwback\\, or trying to make it more PC by casting every ethnicity but typical white person as a main character so that they can appeal to everyone.  Forget about trying to please everyone or to make an action-packed film and get back to Star Wars roots.  The main films were about the characters; not the action.  Two films in\\, and I still feel like Jarjar Binks had better character development than most of the cast so far.","true":true}
