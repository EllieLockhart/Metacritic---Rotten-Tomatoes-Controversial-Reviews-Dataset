Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I regret watching this movie in the theater and I was disappointed when I walked out. Afterwards\\, the more I thought about the movie\\, the more I disliked it. It tried way too hard to subvert your expectations and it was basically a huge middle finger to the fans. JJ has to pull off a miracle to save this trilogy.","true":true}
