Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What an incredible film\\, truly a masterpiece by Rian Johnson. The development of both legacy characters and the newcomers hits just wonderfully. The action works tremendously and it's cinematically beautiful. From a canon perspective\\, it slides in perfectly with the rest of the saga\\, novels\\, comics.etc.  \\n\\nI never thought a Star Wars movie could be better than The Empire Strikes Back. I was wrong. If I could pay extra money for this ticket\\, I would to reward the filmmakers for giving us this beautiful piece of art. The Last Jedi is not only the gold-standard for Lucasfilm\\, but the greatest film Disney has ever produced.","true":true}
