Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an amazing movie. The only reason that other people are rating it low is because stuff happens in the movie that they weren\u2019t ready for or didn\u2019t want to happen. It was beautifully made and was completed different from Episode V (which was a common complaint about Episode VII). ","true":true}
