Also\\, as a personal note I've visited Japan several times\\, so it was a delight to playthough.\r\rContinuing into this entry\\, I was hoping to get a true origin story to both Goro and Kiryu.  Truthfully\\, you don't really get that\\, instead it really is just another dramatic story set before the events of Yakuza Kiwami (or Yakuza 1\\, on the PS2)  Kiryu\\, the series' main protagonist isn't really portrayed as meek\\, instead he is shown to be wiser and as strong as when I saw him in the third entry.\r\rThere wasn't really a deep look into his past\\, such as growing up with Nishiki and Yumi\\, nor any flashback to lessons from thier adoptive father Shintaro.  Kiryu just beats people with his fists and then gives fatherly wisdom (at the ancient age of 26) to mothers\\, misguide youths and old men.\rWhich truly leads me to believe that the series can only be taken serious during the main storyline.\r\rAs for Goro\\, they make him a complete opposite of what he is portrayed in the series.  In 0\\, he's humble and quiet\\, sweet guy whose just conflicted and damaged.  Whereas in the remainder of the series\\, a friggin murderous lunatic dueteragonist.  Granted what he goes through before 1988 would explain insanity.  But none of this is truly developed throughout the main storyline.\r\rAlso\\, the supporting characters act completely different from who they are in Kiwami (which I am playing now\\, and loving it)   What does save the story is the side stories\\, which were funny and some a nice slice of life moment to experience.\r\rIn regards to the gameplay itself\\, the fighting is smoother and remained fresh with the newer HEAT finishers and boss QTEs.  The money system felt a bit exaggerated and really required me to grind through the real estate and cabaret host minigames.  (I liked Majima's more\\, personally)\r\rOverall\\, the shear amount of content in the game is staggering\\, as there are tons of minigames side quests\\, collectibles and two HUGE management portions.\r\rI'd say I had a lot of fun with this entry\\, despite its sloppy writing and almost nonexistent origin story.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
