Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To me this film was a master class in subverting expectations; throughout\\, it would set up something that seemed cliche and obvious\\, and then turn it on its head\\, go a different direction. Because of this\\, because it was able to be unexpected\\, it felt real in a way most movies don't\\, to me; I couldn't see where it was going and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film. I loved every minute of it and can't wait to see it again.","true":true}
