The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Everyone is entitled to their opinion\\, but it breaks my heart to see so many negative reviews for this game.\r\rThis is not an easy story to endure. It\u2019s truly heartbreaking to see these characters that you\u2019ve grown to know so well go through such pain. That being said\\, I would encourage anyone who thinks this story is only about revenge to give it another try with a different lens. The way I see it\\, when Ellie decides to not kill Abby\\, she\u2019s not forgiving Abby so much as she\u2019s forgiving Joel. The fire and pain that fuels her rampage to kill Abby is not exactly fueled by Joel\u2019s death\\, but rather the pain and conflict that comes from Joel\u2019s decision to pull her out of the hospital. Joel is a very flawed character\\, and he\u2019s certainly not a hero. If Ellie had killed Abby\\, she would have been just as bad as Joel was. She loves Joel\\, but she knows his death was a consequence of his actions. She doesn\u2019t think he deserved it\\, per se\\, but she\u2019s just like Abby\\, trying to get revenge for her father\u2019s death. If you can\u2019t empathize with Abby\\, I can understand why you don\u2019t like the game\\, but I would encourage you to try. I found all of the characters to be very well written and very much like real people.\r\rThat\u2019s my essay. The gameplay is also very fun and the graphics are stunning.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
