Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie receives 1.5 Stars only because it is a Star Wars movie\\, a rock-solid part of my childhood and lifetime. Otherwise\\, this movie was a complete mess. Bottom line\\, Kylo Ren is just not working. He?s not scary. Luke was just plain annoying throughout the movie\\, Laura Dern?s character appeared to visiting from the Capital in the Hunger Games\\, and no real reason why she kept her escape mission a secret from Poe\\, who in his ignorance of the plan\\, created a plan with Rose and Finn\\, that was a complete failure (and waste of movie time). \\n\\nI could go on and on - but honestly - this movie just stunk. As a fan born in the late-70?s\\, I thought Rogue One was just amazing. I loved that movie so so much\\, and after seeing The Last Jedi\\, I now consider Rogue One to be the final chapter to MY Star Wars movies.","true":true}
