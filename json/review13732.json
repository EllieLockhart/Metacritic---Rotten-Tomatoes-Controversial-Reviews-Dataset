Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If it wasn't for the visual effects this movie would be terrible. Characters all seem shallow and do things without much purpose. Seems like the director wanted to make a politically correct film with diversity being forcefull pushed onto the story. Diversity is good but not at the expense of the story. After all films are just that\\, stories.  Felt like a gender studies course with idiot and overtly masculin males (emo kylo ren) and calm cool headed females in charge. Anyway thumbs up to the effects department. Movie is watchable but story is weak.","true":true}
