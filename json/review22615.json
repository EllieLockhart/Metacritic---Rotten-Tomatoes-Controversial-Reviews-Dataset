Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lifelong Star Wars fan\/nerd.  Really could not have envisioned a way a \\\"bad\\\" Star Wars movie could ever be made.  \\\"The Trash Jedi\\\" found the way(s).  Trash on every level of the plot and characters.  Everyone deserved better.  ","true":true}
