Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot...well there actually doesn't seem to be a plot.  This was the most boring star wars film of all time\\, with two lame characters having the biggest roles.  Disney has now officially screwed up what was a great franchise.  Too bad...don't waste your money on this.","true":true}
