Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw Last Jedi  ..It SUCKED!!! So many problems! So many issues ..all bad! All the characters were 1 dimensional and the story was written and executed by a child. Rey is definitely a \\\"Mary Sue\\\"\\, Fin \\,the supposed Stormtrooper Extraordinaire\\, is the Cowardly Clown again \\, n Luke has learned nothing in all his years of Meditation and Solace.. for shame? The story absolutely insulted all of the characters abilities and left them all looking like unintelligent buffoons!","true":true}
