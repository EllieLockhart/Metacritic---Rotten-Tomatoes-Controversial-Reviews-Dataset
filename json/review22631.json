Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like a few others on here\\, I signed up so I could rate this particular movie. I had very high hopes for 'The Last Jedi\\,' and I was so ready to love this movie. Then\\, this morning\\, I finally watched it. Words can't adequately express what a colossal disappointment it was. I'm still in shock at how poorly all aspects were executed in this movie. I envy (and question) those that give 'The Last Jedi' such glowing reviews. This movie completely guts the franchise in almost every way possible\\, and it'll be the first Star Wars movie that I don't watch more than once.","true":true}
