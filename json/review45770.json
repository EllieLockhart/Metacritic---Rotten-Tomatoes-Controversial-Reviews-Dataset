Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very satisfying addition to the series. Moving on from the past is not only the theme of the movie but also a requirement to move the saga forward.  Where the previous episode just rehashed previous plot lines\\, this movie was refreshingly novel.","true":true}
