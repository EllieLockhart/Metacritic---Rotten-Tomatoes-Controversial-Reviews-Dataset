Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was an average SW movie.  Better effects and acting than episodes 1-3\\, but the dialogue and writing were similarly poor.  \\n\\nLuke was out of character and given rotten lines\\, and the jokes were too 21st century to be from a galaxy far far away.  The Snoke CGI was poor\\, particularly when he stood up and walked.  Leia flying through space made me cringe.  \\n\\nMany scenes were amazing\\, mostly the battle sequences\\, and Rey is a great hero.  Chewy\\, BB8\\, and R2 are always a pleasure to watch.  The actors all did well with what they were given.","true":true}
