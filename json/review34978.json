Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the film was BEAUTIFULLY SHOT\\, Johnson does have a good eye for that..he simply cannot direct Star Wars films! the fact that KK and Di$ney arbitrarily gave him 3 more films is folly. I think going into these films Di$ney must have said to kill off the OT characters. 'Rey' simply isn't relatable enough to drive this film\\, Adam Driver was great as was Mark...\\n\\nfor the first time in my 42 years on this planet\\, I am NOT looking forward to the next Star Wars film- I have no interest in 'Han Solo' \\, his character is dead... they should have released 'Han Solo' BEFORE TFA... KK screwed the pooch on this","true":true}
