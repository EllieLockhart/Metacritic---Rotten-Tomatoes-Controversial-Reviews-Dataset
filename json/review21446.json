Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I would call it Marvel's Star Wars. It is a fair bit of entertainment\\, stretch way too much and with a lot of forced puns. It didn't create much of a tension and you can say there wasn't the necessary character development. Not to mention the banalisation of the Force we saw in The Force Awakens taken to another level\\, it is all so easy now. We can see data analytics playing a greater role than the art in cinema. Althought it felt like just a filler sometime\\, it does\\, however\\, set a interesting ground for Episode IX. 3D and visuals are really good\\, sound and photography impeccable\\, in that sense it is all you can expect from Star Wars\\, delivering the best there is in Special effects!","true":true}
