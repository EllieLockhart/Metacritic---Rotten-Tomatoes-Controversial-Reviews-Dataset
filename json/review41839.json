Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is such a slap of shit to the face of all Star Wars fans!!  Rian Johnson ruined the character Luke Skywalker! We did not wait all these years to see Luke Skywalker like this.???? Even Mark Hamill himself disagreed with Rian's vision on Luke. This movie shatters our expectations and breaks all of our hearts. Looks like Rian made this for his own personal pleasure and didn't care about the characters and what they did and what they could do. He didn't care about fans. Such a disappointing movie!! \\n\\n(SPOILERS AHEAD!)\\n\\nI'm so pissed off and disappointed in how Luke Skywalker turned out in this movie. We didn't wait all these years to see him like this!!  Ending Luke's character was the most stupidest thing to do. The Resistance and Rey still need Luke's help. He did not deserve to die. Luke Skywalker deserved more..!! Luke is a Jedi Master and we didn't even get a chance to see his full power yet. I hope Disney and JJ Abrams find a way to bring Luke back alive in Episode IX. Or Disney should release the DVD of this movie with an alternate ending where Luke doesn't die. Help us JJ Abrams you are our only hope!","true":true}
