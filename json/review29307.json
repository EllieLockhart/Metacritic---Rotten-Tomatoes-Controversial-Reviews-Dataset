Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian has destroyed star wars for me and my wife. we were talking after seeing this POS last week and its like they wanted to insult the fans by making this. we were planning on going to the disneyland star wars land but not now. I have no more interest in star wars.","true":true}
