Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike the Force Awakens that played it safe by being a remix of the original trilogy\\, The Last Jedi is hands down the most daring Star Wars movie of all time. It holds no punches and is full of surprises and twists. Unfortunately I feel it has polarized a lot of people. And I can see why\\, be aware that this movie goes out of it's way to subvert every single expectation you might have. it also a somber movie than what the advertisements lead on. But ultimately I feel that what was done was incredibly refreshing and for the first time I don't know were the story will go from here. I'm both excited and scared.","true":true}
