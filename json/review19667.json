Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a good Disney film. I like Disney films\\, but it was not a Star Wars film. They should not have messed with Luke. You can\u2019t have Star Wars without Luke Skywalker. Mark Hamill even said \u201che had to act as if it was not Luke Skywalker.\u201d Probably won\u2019t see it again but it was a normal Disney film... a lot of similarities between TLJ and Muana lol ","true":true}
