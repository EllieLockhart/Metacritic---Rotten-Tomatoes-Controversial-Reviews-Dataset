Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I never review movies\\, but this was just a slap in the face to even the casual star wars fan. \\nThe story was incredibly flawed. \\nThe majority of the actions and decisions taken by most of the characters were incoherent.\\nThere are just too many plot holes.\\nIt doesn't line up with previous installments.\\nOther than the visuals\\, this film was a complete waste of time\\, money\\, talent and a beloved franchise.","true":true}
