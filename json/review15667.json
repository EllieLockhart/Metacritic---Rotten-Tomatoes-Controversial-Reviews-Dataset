Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i loved this movie a lot. i loved that it wasnt an exact copy of a previous movie like force awakens kinda was.. the porgy babies were so cute. i think people are being so harsh on this movie for no reason except being butt hurt over some more diversity than movies past or something.. idk. it was good. not perfect but v. good.","true":true}
