Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story about the next generation of the resistance was subpar and did not dive into the characters' background enough to capture attention. The score of the movie did bring back fond memories of what sci-fi music is meant to be. This movie was a stretch to be a considered a great Star Wars film\\, but did offer times of enjoyment.","true":true}
