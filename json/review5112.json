Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics love this movie for some reason\\, but I can't say whether its due to Disney influence. I will say\\, This movie is not as great as people make it out to be. My issues with this film are not derived from its use of characters or astral projecting force powers. No\\, my problem is it's story and the rules it breaks to give audiences a movie that serves \\\"Awe\\\" moments instead of the scenes themselves. It's overuse of Deus Ex Machina and humor destroy any moments of tension presented throughout the film. Throughout the film\\, protagonists are faced with incredible obstacles and challenges that are solved not by there own merit\\, but by some exterior force saving them at the last minute. Every villain in this movie was made the butt end of a joke and renders them unintimidating. If I don't fear the villains\\, why should the heroes? If the heroes are always saved at the last minute\\, why should I worry for their safety? \\n\\nIt feels as though the force awakens never even happened\\, C3PO doesn't even have his red arm from the last film. Which is odd considering this chapter takes place right after the previous just days later. Everything previously set up by JJ Abrams was tossed aside and turned into a red herring just so Rian Johnson could make \\\"HIS\\\" star wars movie. Were left with unfulfilled questions and answers that lack any creative thought. I would rather have never known about Rey's parents than to be presented with \\\"It doesn't matter who your parents are!\\\" no duh...This whole scene could have been ignored and we wouldn't have lost out on anything\\, at least retain the mystery than to give the audience an answer they already knew. Every scene in this movie is just a mechanism that drives the story from one epic moment to the next. This robs every character of development or the space in which they inhabit. The biggest thing that drives the film is a drawn-out \\\"Chase scene\\\" that feels like watching two turtles racing each other. Does the dreadnaught send out more fighters to dispatch the crippled vessel? Do they send Kylo out to board and slaughter the remaining resistance? they can make a planet into a weapon that can destroy other planets from across the galaxy\\, but they cant make engines that can outrun a smaller ship? Their brilliant plan is \\\"Eh\\, we'll just wait\\, I'm sure they won't think of any way to escape\\\" A lot seems to happen in this film\\, but it all feels empty. The relationship between Rose and Finn is shallow and uninspired. People are praising this film for being \\\"Bold\\\" and \\\"Making new choices\\\"\\, but this doesn't make the choices GOOD. If Leia had died at the hands of Kylo's minions it would have presented a beautiful and horrific moment of Irony\\, but instead\\, she's saved at the last minute by her own sudden acquiring of force powers \\\"Hey Leia\\, there's a bunch of rocks blocking our escape\\, think you could use the force again to move the rocks\\, we have guns and explosives\\, but we feel as though a force user should save us.\\\" \\\"Nah guys\\, sorry that was just a one-time? thing\\\" Does Luke's character overcome his fear of teaching a powerful force sensitive being? Not really. Does he remove Kylo's hatred toward him by apologizing for trying to kill him? No\\, instead he eggs him on more and pushes him further into the dark side.\\n\\nCan we stop injecting mindless moments of humor into every movie that touches the big screen? Since Marvel started upping it's moments of humor\\, other films have followed suite even when it doesn't serve the scene. These moments ARE funny\\, but they don't belong in a chapter of the trilogy that's supposed to be relatively dark. The force awakens was more grim than this movie. The people who liked this movie probably liked Justice League.","true":true}
