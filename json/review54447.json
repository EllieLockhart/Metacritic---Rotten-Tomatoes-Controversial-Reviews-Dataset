Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll give my review as an analogy: You've been going to the same Chinese restaurant for years\\, special occasions\\, holidays\\, etc.   You have always really enjoyed the food and you have a sentimental attachment to the place.  Over the years the restaurant had some off nights but you forgave those instances because of the overall experience.  Then you go back one night\\, with all the expectations you've ever had and more because they hired a new chef that is supposed to be incredible.  You sit down and instead of getting your favorite Chinese food you get the shittiest Italian food you've ever had. Not just Olive Garden bad but a can of Prego thrown on cold pasta bad.  You complain but are told by the hostess that the restaurant is moving in a bold new direction.  You complain some more and you are then accused of being sexist because the new chef is female.  You turn to the table next to you and a ten year old says through a mouthful of pasta\\, \\\"I think its great!\\\" You get run out of the restaurant and are told not to come back because they don't need customers like you anymore.  That was The Last Jedi for me.","true":true}
