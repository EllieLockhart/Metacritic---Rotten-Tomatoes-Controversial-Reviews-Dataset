{"101487":118863,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-17","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone here doesn\u2019t work in the industry or understand decent writing. Episode 7 dangled carrots in front of your face only to have the writers flip you off at every turn. Why did Raz have Luke\u2019s lightsaber?! THAT WAS NEVER ANSWERED. Rey\\, Finn\\, or Po\u2019s origins... never answered. And that film broke every rule we\u2019ve been taught about Star Wars. There\u2019s no debate that he lightsaber is the most precious artifact in all of Star Wars. Not just anyone can pickup and use a lightsaber is what we\u2019ve been taught after watching the original saga over and over. Then episode 7 comes along and tells us... ANYONE CAN FIGHT WITH A LIGHTSABER. Anyone who enjoyed episode 7 should really think about what an executive producer does and realize they got screwed over. Episode 8 although filled with plot holes this was way more bearable than its predecessor. We had space battles\\, the characters weren\u2019t put into situations that they weren\u2019t supposed to be in... aka them even being at Raz\u2019s planet in the last one. They just show up there?! Y\u2019all didn\u2019t catch that?! The things that were ruined were in Snoke\\, Rey\\, and Luke\u2019s character development. Snoke is supposed to be the most powerful sith and yet he does nothing and then dies before we know anything about him. Did they really have to kill him off? It\u2019s funny because you can see how hard this franchise is trying to please us but they keep falling flat. Rogue One was the best of the three but the reason why is because when a film is inserted in between two others... there\u2019s not much they can do to ruin it. This film was enjoyable enough to watch but it was like eating pumpkin pie without whipped cream. ","true":true}
