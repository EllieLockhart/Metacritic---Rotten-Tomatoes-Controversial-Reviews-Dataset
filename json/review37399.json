Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with this new trilogy is that there are no original ideas. The prequels besides the dialogue and Jar Jar Binks were good movies. Why? Because they introduced new ideas. They introduced Clones\\, Jedi Academy\\, The Republic\\, The Sepratist Alliance\\, and super cool lightsaber battles. This trilogy just feeds off of peoples nostalgia of the OT. This movie was just a Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back Mashup.","true":true}
