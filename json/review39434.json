Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film just left me cold. I'm almost speechless. The only words I can find to describe this movie are \\\"ridiculous\\\"\\, \\\"ludicrous\\\"\\, \\\"inane\\\". The sole saving grace is that this isn't really a Star Wars movie at all - it's a Marvel one.\\nObviously it appears many disagree and enjoyed the film; they say this is a different Star Wars now; it is *their* Star Wars. All I can say to that is I'm pleased for you and you're welcome to it! *My* Star Wars was the OT\\, (though I enjoyed Rogue One and TFA too) and I definitely know who got the better end of that deal :-)\\nLast thoughts - Mark Hamill was wonderful - he deserved so much better than this.","true":true}
