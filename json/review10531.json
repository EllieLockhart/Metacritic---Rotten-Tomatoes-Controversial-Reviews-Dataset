Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great story that felt fresh. God forbid the writers didn\u2019t pander to the fans and actually provided a story that wasn\u2019t exactly what was expected and overplayed. ","true":true}
