Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this got to be the worse Star Wars film ever.. this Is not my Luke Skywalker and with so many plot holes that just got left from the TFA to this trash.. i mean everything we love about the TFA was just thrown out the window here.. who ever sign off on this was crazy..good bye Star  Wars could care less about the next film..","true":true}
