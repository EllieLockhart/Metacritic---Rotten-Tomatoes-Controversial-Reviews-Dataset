Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very impressed at how this still felt like a classic Star Wars film but also loved how it did so many new things to push the saga forward. I think the writers and director took a risk but it was so worth it. I'm excited I see where things go in episode IX.","true":true}
