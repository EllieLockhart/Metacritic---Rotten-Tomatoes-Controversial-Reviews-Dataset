Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Im almost ashamed to say I complained a fair bit during the release of George Lucas's prequel trilogy.  Don't i feel stupid now\\,  at least they felt like star wars and had some imagination. Others have already outlined everything that is wrong with this movie better than i ever could. \\n\\nSorry George!","true":true}
