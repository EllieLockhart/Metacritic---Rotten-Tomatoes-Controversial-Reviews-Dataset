Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Guardians of the galaxy style humor... it just doesn't fit Disney!!. Plus massive plotholes:\\n- It looks like the last order either only has 3 fighters or its too afraid to waste his troopers life. The whole movie is based on this premise.\\n- You can breathe in the vacuum of space.\\n- Force mechanics are reduced to: if you're a slave you could be the next Anakin!!\\n- You can now jump into hyperspace with cruisers on front. If that was always possible why only now its used. Pretty much makes RotJ and Rogue one seems retarded.\\n- It looks like Poes and Finns plans kills more allies than whatever the whole last order could ever come out. If they just stayed sitted the whole movie the resistance would still exist by the end..","true":true}
