Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's been some kind of studio backlash... trying to insinuate that male chauvinists are somehow rigging the reviews. I think it's complete baloney. \\n\\nIf you read most of the negative reviews\\, you'll find that most of them say absolutely nothing about the sex of a particular character. This movie has negative reviews because it is HORRIBLE. \\n\\nThis movie has demeaned and destroyed the series greatest hero\\, created an overly-complicated storyline\\, added embarrassing one-liners\\, given us a terrible script\\, overacting to compensate for real emotion\\, new characters to pile on top of the ones we already don't like and big\\, convoluted action sequences that belong in the disastrous prequels. \\n\\nIf someone wants to make this about sex-discrimination\\, take that crap elsewhere. This movie just plain SUCKED. \\n\\nI'm a lifelong fan of Star Wars... but this is the end for me.","true":true}
