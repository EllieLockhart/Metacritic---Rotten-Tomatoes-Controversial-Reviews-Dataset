Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete waste of time. It was like watching the compilation of a production team that only cared about three things: Fan service to 250lb nostaligia-nerds with absolutely no originality whatsoever\\, gaining as much cash from merchanizing as possible\\, and shoehorning as many ethnic and gender minorities as humanly possible in order to maintain the narrative that whites must be replaced.","true":true}
