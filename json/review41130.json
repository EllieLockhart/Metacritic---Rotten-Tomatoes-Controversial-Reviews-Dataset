Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie had the opposite problem than TFA: it tried to be shocking with ridiculous twists just for the sake of it. It was full of sloppy mischaracterizations\\, dropped or poorly resolved sub-plots\\, disjointed continuity with TFA and the other films\\, bad music\\, jarring tonal shifts\\, and a boring main character. Further\\, the new movies did not need to destroy the past in order to move on. There is a balance to be struck between being ossified by history \/ tradition and discarding everything. The past can be a great foundation and springboard to leap forward.","true":true}
