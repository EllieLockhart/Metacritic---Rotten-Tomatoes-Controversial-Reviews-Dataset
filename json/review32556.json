Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi has absolutely stunning and incredible visuals!! However\\, the story is kind of confusing and could have been better\\, and the side quest with Rose and Finn was kind of distracting and dumb\\, but you know it\u2019s what we got. And with Snoke\\, that\u2019s a different story (recommend looking up theories and the history of the director\\, it\u2019ll make more sense) but I mainly saw this because I LOVED The Force Awakens and wanted to see more of my bae\\, Kylo Ren! But overall\\, not the best Star Wars\\, but for pure entertainment and visual satisfaction it succeeds!! ","true":true}
