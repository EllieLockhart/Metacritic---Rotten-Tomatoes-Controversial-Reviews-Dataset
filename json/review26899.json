Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best movies in the last 10 years.  I love the complicated\\, human way they dealt with Luke\\, Kylo\\, and Rey.  While still larger than life mythic heroes (see final battle with Luke - awesome!)\\, the humanity in them is what makes them pop.  Beautiful\\, exciting\\, funny\\, inspiring\\, and epic.  And\\, you know\\, women.  There were actually women all over the place!  Nice to near the 50\/50 mark on male-to-female characters-I've never seen anything like it.  My favorite Star Wars movie to date!","true":true}
