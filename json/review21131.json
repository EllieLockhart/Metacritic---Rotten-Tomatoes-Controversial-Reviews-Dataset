Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasted opportunities great first 10 minutes then boils down to a long Chase in space with a crap Side Story ending in a wtf Showdown with little plot development the movie could have been so much more don't Believe the Hype","true":true}
