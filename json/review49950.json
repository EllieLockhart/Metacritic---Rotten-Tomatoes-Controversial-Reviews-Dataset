Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You know the state of the planet when supposed critics are paid to give this dumpster fire of a movie good reviews. I struggle to find anything redeemable about this movie. Everything is so forced and overwritten\\, the plot is riddled with gaping holes\\, the character development is nonexistent\\, and cringe worthy romance and comedy is inserted at the wrong times. Force Awakens was a carbon copy plot but was a good stand-alone movie. The Last Jedi is a just a bad movie in the most powerful movie franchise. The Star Wars movies have always been a return event for me with other friends and family - I will not be reseeing this debauchery.","true":true}
