Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An interesting film that seems to draw inspiration from old war stories in the real world. Very unlike the tone of previous films\\, but I get that they're trying to portray the darkness before the dawn. And the truth is\\, this is usually how the revolutions played out in history. You start with a small army\\, gain some traction\\, win a couple battles but also lose a lot more. Then one day\\, you start a big enough fire to achieve your goals. It's a slow process\\, and I don't blame the fans for finding it boring. Disney seems intent on making the days of darkness seem realistic. But I do find it amazing that after fighting for so many years\\, the rebels still haven't garnered enough support for anything beyond guerrilla warfare.","true":true}
