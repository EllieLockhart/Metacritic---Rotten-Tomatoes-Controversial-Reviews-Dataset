Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it is respectable that Rian Johnson wanted to do something truly new with Star Wars\\, it was executed poorly and resulted in fan outrage.Critical claim for this movie is unfortunately simply pandering to the almighty Disney. \\nRian Johnson\\, wanting to do something new\\, respectably tried to go against everything you would expect in a Star Wars movie\\, but went too far and missed the point of it. There is no lightsaber duel at all\\, technically no clash of lightsabers. Snoke's character was pointless because he's dead. Luke's development and wisdom is replaced with a punk old man with too many one-liners\\, literally. In trying to catch us off guard\\, Rian Johnson only slapped fans of the Star Wars story in the face.\\nAlso Leia's not dead\\, so now whatever they end up doing for her in the next movie will only be an insult to Carrie Fisher's legacy and an insult to her character.","true":true}
