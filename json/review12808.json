Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did not enjoy this movie!!! Leia Poppins\\, Luke milking an alien creature and overall character arc was awful. Rey's Jedi training was pathetic. Snoke was a waste and the movie ending was pointless. I felt so disappointed after wasting my money (IMAX) and my Saturday morning to watch this atrocity of Star Wars movie. I am so sorry but this was not a good Star Wars movie for me.","true":true}
