Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No idea why the audience score is so low.... everyone I know who has seen it loved it and I think somehow some really butthurt diehard fans added too many bad ratings. I laughed out loud\\, and enjoyed the direction it was taken and where it will lead.","true":true}
