Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The technical aspect of this game is really cool\\, good attention to details\\, and we gotta praise the audio-visuals artists and engineers for their amazing work to bringing those visuals to life\\, especially the characters\\, I really enjoyed the smoothness of their facial expressions and physical abilities.

The actors on the other side\\, brought those characters to life in such a heartbreaking way\\, especially Ashley\\, this woman always works hard to deliver an authentic performance\\, and now she was joined by Shannon Woodward\\, who as well we gotta praise her for her amazing performance\/ I loved it.\rThe story:\rI couldn't asked for a better opening to this game\\, the first 2 hours into this game were really beautiful\\, the flashbacks were really touching and such a thoughtful idea from the writers. The transition to 4 years later was epic\\, i loved how we dive into Ellie's new world\\, and we get to witness this conversation with her new people\\, jesse was a good addition to this small journey we had at the beginning\\, their conversation had some mystery as we get to discover what Ellie is up to as they talk about Dina who we haven't met yet\\, so the beginning here is something i have enjoyed\\, I enjoyed the acting so much and their small trip\/ then we get to play as a character we don't know\\, and then I started losing interest\\, i signed up to play as Ellie and joel for this game not Abby\\, and if the creators thought we would feel sorry for abby as we play her\\, they thought wrong\\, we could have understood her pain through Ellie's perspective\\, this game could have been about forgiveness!\rI wasn't against the idea of joel's death\\, but it was brutal\\, and happened way too soon!\rI loved the company of dina through this revenge journey\\, very cool idea\\, what i didn't like is tommy going first!!!\rThen again\\, neil gave his Ellie unnecessary trauma and pain for nothing\\, he could have given her a happy ending and end of story i wouldn't be mad right now that he ruined a character i cared about!\rso i hated playing as the enemy\\, i don't see any philosophy behind this stupid 2 perspectives\\, and at the end they could have given us the choice of killing her or not!\rplus it was selfish of neil to destroy those characters\\, there was no open mind for me\\, and abby was a useless addition\\, plus anger takes of her when joel is died\\, so again we were angry and we HATE HER. anyways why Ellie had to lose 2 fingers\\, isn't this fiction for god's sake?\rThis is neil's story and he said fu to the fans\\, like literally! this is not a game for the fans\\, this is him being selfish!\rThis gam\ragain for all those 0 reviews\\, fu 2\\, don't be a **** this games doesn't deserve 0 because joel died\\, there are good things about it\\, again fu for giving it a 0\\, you're just as stupid as neil druckmann!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
