Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unnecessary long movie with again unconvincing villains (e.g. Kylo Res\\, Supreme Leader Snoke) that fails completely to make a credible story taking place in the Star Wars universe. Heroine Rey part did not meet the expectations of the audience. A totally contrary to mythos Luke Skywalker saves the movie but destroying all beliefs on the Jedi code. This is despite the wonderful acting of Mark Hamill and Ms Ridley. Again there is no direction or focus in these new trilogy that relies solely on fantastic special eft and action scenes. Jedi battles cannot compare to the prequel trilogy which actually enriched the franchise with the fantasy and mysticism of Star Wars.","true":true}
