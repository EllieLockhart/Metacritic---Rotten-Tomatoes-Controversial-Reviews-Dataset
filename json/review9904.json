Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great complex movie. If you are going expecting a relaunch of the old Star Wars\\, check your expectations at the door. There were a couple of subplots that seemed out of place but they may play into future movies. My only complaint is i couldn\u2019t decide when the movie was about to end. It seems to end\\, then end again\\, then it finally ended. It was entertaining and wrestled with the problems of both the with and Jedi. ","true":true}
