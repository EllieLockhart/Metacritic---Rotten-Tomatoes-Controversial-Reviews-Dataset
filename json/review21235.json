Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I watched this when it originally came out. I wanted to wait until episode 9 came out to try and give this movie a chance. I thought\\, \\\"Maybe Disney can salvage this movie.\\\" However\\, that is not the case. I think that cinematically this is an amazing film. The visuals and way that the movie is shot is incredible. However\\, the story is bogged down. This film breaks so many aspects of the StarWars lore that it is sad. There are a lot of cheesy and uncalled for moments. At one point Leah starts to breathe in the vacuum of space for some odd reason? I could go into more\\, but I digress.","true":true}
