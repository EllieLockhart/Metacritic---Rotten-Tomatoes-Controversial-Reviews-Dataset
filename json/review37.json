Gameplay is top notch\\, I would say better than the GTA series just because the combat system has much more variety. Nonetheless\\, you can still beat the game even at hard difficulty just using block and the main combo you learn at the start as many of the moves you learn throughout the game feel rather unnecessary. On the upside\\, there are at least 5 different mini games that can all put a smile at your face. The main drawback is perhaps the fact that you have to listen through so much dialogue which is told in Japanese and you will find yourself clicking the skip button quite a lot. Graphics on the PS4 are rather pathetic\\, so I would say go for the PC version if you have the option. Still\\, my PS4 Pro did not emit too much excessive noise while rendering the game\\, which is usually the case with the newer games.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
