Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly this movie didn't meet my expectations at all. I was so disappointed to see well loved and established characters be destroyed in the movie\\, almost as if their presence was an inconvenience. There has been lots of talk about establishing new characters etc\\, but seriously by disrespecting the old\\, and if they were half decent believable characters maybe I might have been sold on this concept.\\n\\nA combination of plot holes\\, waste of time storylines and blatant Disney political and marketing agenda has ruined Star Wars for me. \\n\\nI give this movie half star simp\\,y because I'm not sure I could ever face watching it again and it didn't even appeal to my young children who struggled to find a love and passion for any particular character in this film.","true":true}
