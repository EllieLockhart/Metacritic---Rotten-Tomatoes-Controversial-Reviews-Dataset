Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A visually appealing movie with a poorly constructed narrative.\\n\\nIts weird\\, I haven't seen any reviews talk about it\\, but this movie sets up so many narrative themes that don't pay off in the end\\, even going completely against the theme in some cases. You might be hearing \\\"this Star Wars movie throws some twists at you.\\\" No\\, that's not what I'm saying. This movie doesn't not know how to tell a coherent story and will sacrifice any story beats that have been building for the sake of a visually stunning action scene.\\n\\nIt doesn't help that an additional act was seemingly jammed into the movie for no reason. You can legitimately cut out an hour of the movie and still have it make just as much sense. I'm not kidding\\, there is an entire segment of the movie\\, about an hour long\\, where at the end a thing happen that basically makes the entire last hour pointless. I assume it was added in so they can make a toy at of some of the creatures from it later.\\n\\nWhat it does though is mess with the act structure\\, to the point that you'll assume the movie is over only to slowly realize they are just gonna do an entire additional act. There are two separate act three's in this movie. Both are fine\\, but the second one feels wrong because there is no rising action building up to it.\\n\\nI think act 3.1 was supposed to be the 2nd act but jamming that extra section in for toy making purposes messed everything up.\\n\\nIts tough to elaborate without spoiling things. The movie is just a big mess with some cool set pieces.","true":true}
