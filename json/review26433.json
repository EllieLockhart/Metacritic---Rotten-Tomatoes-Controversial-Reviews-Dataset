Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not your usual Star Wars movie\\, but the plot and the character development are amazing. The details\\, effects and battles are unbelievable. Maybe not in line with your personal Star Wars theory but it takes into question the whole problem with extremes like Siths and Jedis. Everything is about balance it has always been it is just making it more obvious. Great movie. True fans will agree.","true":true}
