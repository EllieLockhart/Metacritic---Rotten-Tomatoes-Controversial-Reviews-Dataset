Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Senseless and incomprehensible plot. Little to no thought was put into this movie\\, and instead\\, it seems content to rest on the Star Wars brand to prop up the story. The character's motivations make very little sense\\, and the contradictions and plot holes pile up faster than the viewer can process.","true":true}
