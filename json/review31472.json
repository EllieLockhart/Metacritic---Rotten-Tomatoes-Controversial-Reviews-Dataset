Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some scenes were an absolute blast\\, that evoked the original movies and were expertly crafted\\, but overall the movie over-promised and under-delivered and it also killed off some familiar faces that could be crucial to the ending of the saga in the next movie. The character development is way too important here and still manages to feel useless. Concluding\\, the movie was still entertaining\\, but it took a very risky dive and screwed up in terms of delivering a complete Star Wars experience.","true":true}
