Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie but it was not to be.  Corny dialogue\\, too much time developing characters that were killed off or had nothing to contribute to the story and not enough time developing thee ones introduced in the previous film.  Way too many plot holes and just sloppy story telling.","true":true}
