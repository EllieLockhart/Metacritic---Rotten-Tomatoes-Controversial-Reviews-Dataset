Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having a hard time understanding how anyone could give this garbage more than one star.  Huge SW fan at 44 years old.  This movie ended any more interest I have in Disney's version of Star Wars.  As far as I'm concerned TFA and TLJ are fan fiction.  I like the Prequels for the most part.  I'm pretty easy to please.  But Disney's desire to destroy the Original Trilogy with the events of these new movies boggles the mind.","true":true}
