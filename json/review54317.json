Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate those degraded flocks of people\\, they're already nowadays ready to switch every legendary series in any genre to the Marvel type of movie and they'll try to blame the rest of people for not gobbling this garbage up like they did. 7 and 8 were made for them and damn\\, they're already excited and ask more shovel with s*** to feed em more. And damn\\, this garbage will continue to come out cause they make a demand for it and they like it.\\n\\nI don't even want to say something about this trash\\, it's not Star Wars\\, it's a day of death of Star Wars\\, all u need to know about this piece of cr** that's space saga movie is not even in space\\, because bombs don't fall in space down LMAO Fu****g talentless Ryan Johnson in this movie fu***d up almost everything related to Star Wars movie that he could.During 2.5 hours of watching I was not left with a thought that fu***** smelly Mikki Mouse rapes my brain with a full of power that he can\\, urinates on top of graves of Khan Solo\\, Luke Skywalker and wants my money for toys.\\n\\nIf u're 10\/10 fan of \\\"this\\\" then tell me in 5 minutes what is this \\\"movie\\\" about\\, who is Snoak\\, where he came from and what he wanted to do\\, how newly created First Order has become more powerful than Vader's Empire with a clowns on top\\, from where the miscarriage of addicts took strength stronger than Kylo Ren? if u can't give me nothing except \\\"don't be dick\\, enjoy the movie\\, enjoy the graphics\\\" then it's not a Star Wars movie\\, it's Marvel\\, because Star Wars movies always been a beautiful soulful films about kindness\\, the true friendship with logical and completed stories and plots\\, not for ur fap on graphics and how cool when one ship f***** into another. Totally pathetic disgrace\\, Mikki Mouse and Ryan Johnson just get the f*** out of my series\\, I don't want to see u anymore","true":true}
