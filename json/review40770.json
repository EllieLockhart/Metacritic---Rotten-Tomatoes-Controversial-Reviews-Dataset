Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This move was trash. It had nothing to do with women as the lead or having minorities ( im a black male) the last movies had powerful women and minorities. Critics fell in love with how the movie was filmed and how it looked. This was not Star Wars. If I go to a basketball game I want to see a game of Basketball. The players and Stars change but the concept of a player having to practice\\, win\\, lose\\, put the basket in the hoop\\, and playing defense\\, is why people love the game. But if I show up to a game and the players got on ice skates\\, a football helmet\\, and wearing boxing gloves\\, it's not basketball. That's what this film did. This movie was disrespected so critics can like it and abandoning the fans that supported the movie for years. Star Wars is 40 years old and nothing about its basic concepts had to change to gain new fans. Good luck with your toy grab. I'm done with Star Wars. I will not Support anymore films. Me or my 7 kids. Whom all were disappointed in this garbage. FUCK YOU DISNEY.","true":true}
