Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not sure what I watched ... the dialogue is awful\\, the characters seem odd\\, and the plot meandering. This is not Empires Strikes Back... nor remotely close to last year's Rouge One\\, more like  Attack of the Clones.\\n\\nI'm not sure why the critic reviews are so good ... I thought this was mediocre.","true":true}
