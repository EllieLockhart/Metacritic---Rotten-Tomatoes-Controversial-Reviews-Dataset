Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kathleen Kennedy is a misandrist to the highest degree and she hates men and is waging a war on men through cinema.  She has completely ruined a 40 year old majorly successful franchise  with her sjw feminiatzism.  The Last Jedi is the Last Star Wars movie I will ever go see as long as she is in charge of production.  The movie was terrible\\, and so were the previous two that she had a hand in!!  It goes out of its way to portray women as super strong (which I don't have a problem with) but why does it have to do it at the expense of men?  The men are weak and incompetent and Luke was portrayed as this weak sniveling punk hermit or purmit.  This Rey Mary Sue main character is truly unpalatable.  She has no training\\, and no knowledge of the force\\, yet she can do anything!  Really??  This whole anything you can do I can do better\\, in heels no less\\, is ridiculous.  You cannot alienate your core audience in order to push some feminist agenda.  Disney better fire this vile woman or it will cost them financially.","true":true}
