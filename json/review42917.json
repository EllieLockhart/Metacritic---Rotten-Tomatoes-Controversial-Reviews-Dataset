Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so horrible that ever time I think about it\\, a single tear is shed from the corner of my eye.  If you thought this movie was good... I do not hate or dislike you.  But I do encourage you to go on youtube and watch almost any video breaking down how garbage this movie was and your eyes shall be opened.  Star Wars was not just killed by this movie\\, but murdered.  May the force be with us all... especially in this time of darkness :'(","true":true}
