Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Zero character building and bad acting made me care less about any of the new characters that were introduced. Sooo many plot holes I cant even count. Overall I wish I would of waited till it was on Netflix.","true":true}
