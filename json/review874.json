{"101487":103696,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-15","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An improvement over 2015's The Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi is an enjoyable enough movie that fails to live up to the lofty hype and legacy of the Star Wars universe. \\n\\nIt's not for a lack of trying\\, however. Rian Johnson--talented director of smaller masterpieces such as Looper--does his best to take the saga in new places\\, while never straying too far from the watchful eye of Papa Mouse. The results are mixed\\, and the movie suffers from bouts of inconsistent tone and disjointed plotting. Everything \\\"seems\\\" to come together at the end. All the pieces appear to fit. But upon closer examination\\, many parts reveal themselves to be unnecessary.  It's a loop to get from point A to B\\, an expenditure for a few seconds of characterization that could be handled in a fraction of the time with zero consequence. \\n\\nThe stakes in this type of story are always high: life\\, freedom\\, the very universe itself. Yet after five movies of Rebellion (or is it Resistance now?) the tapestry of danger has become threadbare. Will anything ever change? Are these momentary hints at a New Hope honestly worth seeing the heroes from the OT become such cynical\\, broken shells?\\n\\nThing this new trilogy has going for it is its charismatic\\, talented young leads. Rey and Poe are done right. Finn is wasted\\, imo\\, on a wraparound quest that reduces him to a plot device for Poe's benefit. There's a new character whose name I can't remember\\, who's nothing more than a plucky mouthpiece\\, but has potential as hopefully more than just Finn's love interest. \\n\\nYou'll read and see some criticism about the underlying message of the movie\\, about it's social stance. Are these criticisms valid? Perhaps. Is it worth giving credence to them? Depends on you. This is a Rorschach test of a movie. You'll see what you want. I found TLJ to be preachy at times\\, a bit more metaphorical than it needed to be. It's an interest situation: for this franchise to continue to be relavent and youthful\\, it's chosen to become more overtly political. It works some places and fails it others. Most of the time\\, you won't even notice it. \\n\\nAll in all: good movie\\, but overhyped critically and far from great. It shows its 152 minute runtime near the end. Many plot threads are ignored or have unsatisfying resolutions. It's a bittersweet end to the heroes of the original movies. \\n\\nBut it's worth seeing\\, and who are we kidding? Of course you'll see it. But while Disney's Star Wars understands the beats necessary to satisfy the zeitgeist\\, and knows how to play with the pumping heart from which it comes\\, I wonder if something has been lost in the dealings of its soul.\\n\\nThis isn't your father's Star Wars\\, and it never will be again. TLJ goes to painstaking measures to remind you that again and again.","true":true}
