Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sucked. Disney is to stupid to incorporate old and new for greater gain. They would rather kill off the great old (believing they can create better) so the new doesn't have competition. What does that tell you about confidence in the new caricatures?....Yup...lacking.","true":true}
