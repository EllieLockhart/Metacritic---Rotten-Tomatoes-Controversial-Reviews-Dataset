Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I knew I was in for a shit show when not even 5 minutes into the movie\\, they made Gen. Hux out to be an absolute buffoon. It felt immediately like a bad Austin Powers film. I really thought Rian Johnson was going to push the series in the right direction\\, but I was wrong.","true":true}
