Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie sucked. The plot made no sense\\, they ruined Luke\\, and I'm utterly bewildered by the high critic rating. Also\\, there was minimal action and hardly any actual lightsaber usage.","true":true}
