Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1. Luke is not Luke (from \\\"i can redeem Darth Vader\\, the second evilest guy in the galaxy\\\" to \\\"i should just slaughter my nephew and then severe my connection with my sister and my friends..and the force...just because\\\").\\n2. The plan is stupid\\, why would a general (Holdo) keep the plan secret from his underlings?\\n3. Hyperspace ramming...why didn't they do it to the death star too if this was a thing?\\n4. NO TRAINING AT ALL AND NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Luke needed to train for MONTHS with Yoda and it was one of the strongest part of the movie\\, the spectator gets to know more about the force\\, about the main character and his inner feeelings and his struggles and gets to know Yoda and his relationship with his student.\\nRey does 2 training sessions that last some minutes and BAM she knows everything\\, no struggles at all\\, no learning.\\n5. Forced jokes\\, not funny at all\\, just randomly put there to catch the audience off guard\\n6. Leia is kinda too much strong (superman-like force flight in the space? really?) with powers like that\\, nothing is really a menace\\n7. Boring Sidequests\\n8. Snoke-Heffner was a big disappointment.\\n9. THE PLOT...the entire plot is a chase..in space...why just don't jump in hypersace in front of the Republic\/rebels ship since they can't jump anymore?\\n10. The message...kill the past....quite the postmodern message...KILL THE PAST INSTEAD OF LEARN FROM IT?\\n11 Forced romance between 2 characters with ZERO chemistry (Finn and Rose).\\n12. This is hinerited from Ep.7..where the heck did the first order come from? The republic has beaten the empire and after 30 years the first order has the resources to build a gigantic army and a weapon that is like 6 deathstars...so in 30 years something that is much more rich and powerful than the empire just spawns under the republic's nose?\\n12. Everyone can use the force (and wthout training!)\\, everyone is special...that means that noone is special enymore. ","true":true}
