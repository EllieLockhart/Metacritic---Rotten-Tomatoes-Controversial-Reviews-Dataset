Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It changes everything you knew about Star Wars. This movie makes every lasting changes to the star wars universe and contradicts the entire saga. It is also filled with so many false endings that you loose touch of the movie by the end. Rian Johnson seams to write in plot twist after plot twist that do nothing but confuse the audience. He subverts expectations so much it becomes meaningless. It also does not build on the seventh film and does nothing to set up the next one.  Disney clearly had no strategic plan for the trilogy as a whole.  It should be written as one story and the movies are split up into three parts.  A very confusing and boring move to watch.","true":true}
