Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I Grew up and LOVED the original trilogy\\, the prequels were okay but could have been way better. The Last Jedi is Phenomenal! I keep seeing reviews about it being too slow and boring but it wasn't\\, if you listen to the dialogue it was fantastic how the story was driven with Luke and Rey. I understand why he was the way he was\\, he felt that he failed.... I don't understand why all the bad reviews\\, this movie has everything I want in a good Star Wars film! the characters were already introduced and pretty much explained in the Force Awakens\\, what more do you want? And the whole Snoke thing\\, it just proves how demented and evil Kylo Ren is\\, he doesn't give any crap about anything else except killing Luke! Once again this movie is fantastic... its still no Empire Strikes back\\, but its pretty damn close!","true":true}
