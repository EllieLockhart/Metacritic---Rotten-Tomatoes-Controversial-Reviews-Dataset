Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An ok movie\\, not the end game (best) of all Star Wars Movies as rumured. To many holes in the story and to many scenarios that lead to another scenario\\, fight\\, run\\, hide\\, escape\\, then its fight\\, run\\, hide and escape again\\, over and over again. Scenes seemed scattered and I often wished the movie would just end already. I gave it 3 stars for the humor\\, some scenes were funny as heck! If the movie was a touch darker I would have enjoyed it more. ","true":true}
