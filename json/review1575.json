{"101487":105167,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a life long Star Wars fan\\, the last Jedi is awful. Luke Skywalker was the new hope and he would have never turned his back on what he cares about. He did not strike his father down because he had hope. For him to be hopeless\\, is just stupid. Also\\, Anakin was the chosen one and now members of his blood line are so weak in the force that they can't defeat a noob? I call b.s. It really kills the idea the the Skywalker blood line even matters. I'm not planning on seeing episode 9.","true":true}
