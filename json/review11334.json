Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrendous. \\n\\nA social justice nightmare. Every white male in the film was either incredibly incompetent or a nefarious\/evil character. Star Wars: Episode IV was the first movie I saw as a child\\, it's incredibly sad what the franchise has become. \\n\\nRIP Star Wars","true":true}
