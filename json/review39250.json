Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film had great potential but it blew it spectacularly\\,  none of the main cast were particularly interesting and the story even more so\\, I lost count of how many times this film made me cringe\\, I could list all the things in this film that made it cringe worthy for me and I would be here all day\\, instead I would rather point out this films missed opportunities that could of made this film not great but fairly decent. One of the missed opportunities was the further exploration of the wealthy elitists on the casino planet and their dealings with both the rebels and 'first order' in weapons sales and how they are exploiting the conflict to their own advantage\\, another missed opportunity was when Luke realising that the Jedi were just as flawed as the Sith and he could of chose the path of a grey Jedi in an effort to find true long lasting balance\\, sadly none of the things were explored instead we got the lowbrow swill we have come to expect from Hollywood these days.","true":true}
