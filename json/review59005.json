We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I truly loved this game\\, even though it left me feeling emotionally exhausted. I'll definitely be playing it again\\, just probably not for a few months. The story was superb\\, the only thing is that I would argue that it could use some re-structuring to avoid some emotional whiplash.\r\rMy biggest complaint is that we weren't made to care about Abby before she killed Joel. We should have cared about all of her friends before Ellie killed them too. To me\\, that would have made playing as Abby more enjoyable (I didn't really come around to her until Yara and Nev were introduced) and it would have made it more devastating to see Ellie kill the rest\\, particularly Owen and Mel. When I first started playing as Abby\\, I legitimately went out of my way to get her killed because I just despised her. Even though I knew she was a good character with relatable motivations\\, I couldn't get over her killing Joel and then Jesse\\, who I really did like as a side character even though he was only around for maybe 20 minutes total.\r\rThe gameplay was just a better version of the first game with more fluid movement (still not perfect\\, but better) and a few more mechanics\/enemies. The graphics were gorgeous. The dialogue was great. Even if the story was out of order\\, I loved the characters and they were very real. Even though I wanted to rip my hair out a couple of times\\, it made sense to me that neither women were willing to lay aside their revenge. And by the end\\, Ellie's actually become more of a villain\\, which was a reflection of how Joel lost his way and went to **** after Sarah\/before Ellie.\r\rEven though it hurt and it was difficult\\, Joel's death made sense for the story. In a lot of ways\\, it was a bit of karmic retribution for all the bad he'd done. Most of which we as the audience don't know about because it wasn't the focus of the first game.  If we'd followed Abby's story from the beginning and not known the man she was hunting was Joel\\, she would have been a sympathetic hero from the start. By the end\\, I loved her almost as much as Ellie\\, which I think was impressive considering how much I disliked her at first.\r\rI would actually say this game is between a 9-10 with its weaknesses\\, but it's closer to a 10 than a 9.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
