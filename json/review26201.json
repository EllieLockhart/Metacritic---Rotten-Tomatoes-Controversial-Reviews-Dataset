Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what is up with haters.  I was lucky to be able to see the original in 1977. I have grown up with Star Wars since I was 19 years old. That being said I have to say this was the best of the series. Empire is always the sentimental favorite but for sheer enjoyment this can't be beat. Gets better with each viewing. Have already seen it 3 times.  I urge everyone who enjoyed this to leave a positive review to balance the darkness of the bad reviews. As Luke said balance powerful light and powerful darkness.","true":true}
