Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very bad.  couldnt believe i was watching this happen to my beloved saga when i was in the theater.  absolute garbage.\\n\\nInane plot\\, ill-conceived characters and script\\, stupid cameos\\, flashy gimmicky special effects\\, unrelated and superfluous political agenda\\, and a complete lack of the originality and substance that made the originals work so well.  unconvincing\\, uninteresting\\, uninspiring heroes and even worse villains.  these are just a few of the major problems.\\n\\ni guess i am perhaps old fashioned.  this movie was just like all these recent superhero action flicks that i can't bear to watch but the general public seems to adore.  i didn't particularly enjoy the last couple SW efforts either\\, but never thought it could get this bad.  the saga is ruined.","true":true}
