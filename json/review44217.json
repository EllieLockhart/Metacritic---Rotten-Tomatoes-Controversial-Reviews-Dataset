Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too boring\\, dreary\\, convoluted and talky for a child to enjoy\\, too incoherent and irrational for an adult to enjoy.\\n\\nI see others have done a fine job pointing out the overwhelming\\, unforgivable flaws of Last Jedi.  So awful it was actually poisoning my memory of the original movies\\, but I think it will flush out of my mind in a few days.\\n\\nI hear rumors the Han Solo garbage is going to be scrapped.  Let's hope and pray this is true and Disney stops desecrating the remains of Star Wars.","true":true}
