Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm so utterly disappointed by this film.\\n\\nObjectively\\, if I had been watching this movie from nearly clean slate\\, which is\\, I understand\\, the way Rian Johnson wrote and directed it\\, then it would probably be pretty good.  Cinematically it's pretty.  Pacing wise it is strong.  Rian can make a decent movie.  That's not the problem.\\nThe problem is\\, Rian\\, this is bloody STAR WARS!  No-one goes to a STAR WARS with a clean slate.  You go in wanting to be drawn back into the 'STAR WARS' space opera fantasy - and while it doesn't have to exactly follow the latest in astrophysics it still needs to MAKE SENSE based on what has come before.  It needs to be internally consistent - like any good story.  Both in character and physics.\\nClearly Rian said 'I want this part to FEEL a certain way' but instead of taking the time to generate a situation like that within the context of Star Wars he just snapped his fingers and said 'this is how it is...'  So if a viewer knows or cares about how Star Wars works - how certain characters are\\, what the conceits of the settings science are\\, or basically if you ever ask yourself a trivial question like 'well\\, why dodn't you just launch some bombers\\, you muppets?' your suspension of disbelief and enjoyment is just completely shattered.","true":true}
