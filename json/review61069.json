Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Upsides: graphics are amazing\\, and the game is beautiful. The accessibility features are great\\, and as someone who sometimes fumbles with controls\\, that they are the same as the previous game is an excellent move\\, as so many game series move them around.\r\rDownsides...\rSide characters are included in a way that suggests we're supposed to care about them because the protagonist cares about them.. but the relationships aren't earned\\, they aren't displayed in any meaningful way (Compare and contrast with Joel and his daughter\\, from The Last of Us) so they feel artificial. The rapport that is supposed to exist between any of them feels hollow. Why should I care about Eugene? Jesse? Dina? I don't know these characters\\, I haven't spent time with them\\, so I don't care.\r\rThe clickers take a back seat. They're there\\, but surviving them isn't the main problem any more. They're just there to remind the player that this is the Last of Us\\, and there's a permanent threat\\, as well as a leg up when the story stalls.\r\rCharacter development feels non-existent. There's no redemptive arc\\, or any significant change other than an abrupt heel-face-turn at the end.\r\rThe deuteragonist is not a character I want to play as; why anyone thought it would be interesting to play as the bad guy is entirely beyond me\r\rLast\\, but not least\\, the killing of a fan favourite character... destroyed the whole reason I wanted the game in the first place\\, turning the rest into a pointless slog\\, like forever reading a book from the perspective of the least favourite characters and never getting to the chapters containing the characters that are of actual interest.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
