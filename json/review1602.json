Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time fan of the Star Wars franchise\\, The Last Jedi is my favorite Disney-era Star Wars movie to date. Rian Johnson delivered a film that went beyond simple fan service and took everyone completely by surprise with its interesting plot twists and character development. It is a thrilling ride that I look forward to watching again and again.","true":true}
