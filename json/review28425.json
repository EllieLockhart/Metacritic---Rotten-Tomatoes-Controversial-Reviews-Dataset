Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Prepare for the dark(er) side of Star Wars and you won't be disappointed. It wasn't what I expected but it was enjoyable. Some very poignant moments\\, and some very funny ones as well. Just didn't live up to the the last instalment in my very humble and non-expert opinion.","true":true}
