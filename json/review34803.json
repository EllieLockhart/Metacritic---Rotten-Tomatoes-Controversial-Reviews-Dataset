Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Disney-ification of the Star Wars universe is complete.  Several new one dimensional characters and an extremely lazy plot (1\/3 of the plot action is a completely unnecessary side-jaunt to a casino world to search for a mcguffin).  The dialogue was super-corny\\, even at moments that should have been dramatic.  Comedic relief efforts fell very flat.    Positives of great performances from Hamill\\, Ridley and Driver\\, as well as beautiful visuals were not enough to save a script.  This movie feels like a poor remake of hunger games crossed with a marvel comic hero flick.","true":true}
