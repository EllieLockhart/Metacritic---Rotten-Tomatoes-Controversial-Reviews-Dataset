Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The director thought it would be a good idea to challenge the audiences by giving them something they couldn't predict\/expect. All that did was make me never want to see this movie again or buy anything related to the last Jedi. I won't show my kids this new trilogy. Stick with 4\\, 5 and 6.","true":true}
