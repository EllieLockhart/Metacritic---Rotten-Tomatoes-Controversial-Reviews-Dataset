Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"what this film did to Mark is a disgrace. it showed no respect for the old characters or even the last instalment. with plot holes and really unnecessary plots. this film makes me sad for the future of starwars","true":true}
