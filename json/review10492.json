Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great stand alone sci-fi film\\, terribly star wars story that disregarded the legacy built by the previous 7 films in the saga. If you are true star wars fan that has been deeply invested in the lore\\, you will likely find aspects of this film insulting. There too many issues to list\\, especially the treatment of legacy characters like leah and luke Skywalker. I encourage  you to look for unbiased negative reviews from others here and on youtube to find out what the issues are.","true":true}
