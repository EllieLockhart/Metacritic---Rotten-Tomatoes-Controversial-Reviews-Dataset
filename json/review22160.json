Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Kudos to Johnson for doing something different with the Star Wars mythos. It would have been easy to just write ESB 2.0 to follow the plot points of ANH 2.0 but Johnson approached them and then subverted them\\, making this trilogy it's own rather than a rehash. Will see again happily.","true":true}
