Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. Luke's story should have had a much better finale\\, particularly for the fans that have invested 40 years of life into these brilliant characters.  Adam Driver was fantastic and has proper depth to his character and performance. Couldn't have cared less if Finn had flown into that ram. Captain Phasma - what a terrible character! Should have been developed more. I had to watch Rogue One again that day to bring balance back.","true":true}
