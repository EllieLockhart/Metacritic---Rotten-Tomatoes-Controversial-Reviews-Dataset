Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Puck you Star Whores. Killing off Luke was the last straw. I gave you Han Solo cause I was aware he didn't even really want to be in the movie\\, but Luke! As the last Jedi he was suppose to start a Hogwarts like school for little Jedi you idiots! He knew that. You knew that. It was his only logic step.","true":true}
