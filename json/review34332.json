Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The actors do what they can with Johnson's confused script and even more confused direction\\, but the film falls short-far\\, far short-of Abrams's The Force Awakens\\, which understood the formula of the Star Wars universe and seamlessly integrated new characters with old favourites for a rollicking good time. By contrast\\, The Last Jedi is overlong\\, needlessly complicated\\, and ultimately\\, pointless. Too bad they didn't go with Kasdan's script-he clearly has a better understanding of the source material.","true":true}
