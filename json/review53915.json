Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How do I give this 0 stars? I'll  have to settle for 1\/2 out of 5.\\n\\nRey - Jedi master without training or effort. Defeats all comers with a light sabre. Got a 2 minute training session from luke on how to breath. Can life a mountain of boulders. Has had no Force training. Even annakin had his limbs cut off\\, suffered\\, and came through the sacrafice to be a master. Rey is a complete mary sue - Knows Wookie language\\, flys the Falcon\\, defeats Luke in a duel. Come on\\, I'm not a 12 yo kid\\, give me some substance.\\n\\nLuke - some random guy trashing everything he suffered through gaining his Jedi Master status. Does essentially\\, nothing.\\nYoda - trashing the force and laughing about it like he's been smoking crack\\n\\nFinn - nothing character who does nothing\\n\\nRose - knows all the empires secret data about their star destroyers\\, does nothing with finn\\, another mary sue.\\nLeia - displays force powers while unconscious in space. Shoots Poe without knowing what he is doing.\\n\\nHoldo - some random woman getting the rebel fleet destroyed while wearing non-issue evening dress\\, and she's supposed to be vice admiral - even Rose is in some kind of uniform.\\n\\nsnoke - most powerful force ussr ever seen\\, but can't see Kylo's lilies trick of manipulating the light sabre. Dies withour us fining out anything about him. \\n\\nKylo Ren. probably the best character\\, but is not supreme leader after killing snake. Is there not even a power struggle to  fill the vacuum?\\n\\nThis movie is for 12 year old kids who want to see a Disney film\\, it is not a Star Wars film that follows on from all that been created in the previous SW films. It is rubbish.","true":true}
