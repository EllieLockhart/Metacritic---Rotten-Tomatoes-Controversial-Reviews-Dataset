Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While TLJ would excel and excite as a stand alone\\, it fails miserably as a sequel. It took all the main plot points and questions postured in Abram's TFA and bulldozed them over for RJ's vision of the trilogy\\, which I found to be sad and selfish. In an attempt to break away from the OT\\, it did so in a manner that will leave a sour taste for most emphatic fans. Furthermore\\, unnecessary subplots\\, bad dialogue\\, and incessant cheesy humor at inappropriate places just took the magic out of it for me. That being said\\, it is a visual masterpiece with plenty of action to distract you from these shortcomings. Many will love TLJ for what it is\\, but many will also hate it for what it isn't.","true":true}
