Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've read some rough reviews out there. Yes\\, the flying space wizard was a bit much to swallow. The Plot holes and rule breaking was rough. But remember\\, this isn't a scientifically accurate space movie. This is a space opera. It was enjoyable for what it's worth. The dual light saber fight in the throne room was fun. Overall\\, it could've been better. Still enjoyable though.","true":true}
