Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It feels really long\\, everything that could of been meaningful is replaced with 'gotcha' moments. It looks great but none of it has any real meaning\\, the most visually stunning scene is completely wasted as its very presence completely ruins all previous star wars space battles.","true":true}
