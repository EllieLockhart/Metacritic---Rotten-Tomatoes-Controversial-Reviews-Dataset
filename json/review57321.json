Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is such a fun ride\\, and such a fresh addition to the franchise. Action sequences are great\\, jokes that genuinely make you laugh\\, and a deepening of the themes that allows for much more interesting characters you really care about than these movies have previously offered. Would recommend to anyone and will be seeing again myself\\, don't be scared off by the small contingent who seem to have wanted some specific puzzle box movie they didn't get. All I want from a movie is a good time and something joyful or interesting to chew on\\, and this delivers on all fronts.","true":true}
