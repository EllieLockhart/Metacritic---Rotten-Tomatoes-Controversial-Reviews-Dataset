Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a very different film from Force Awakens. That movie was fun but didn\u2019t have much depth. This movie has more depth and the stakes are higher\\, but it\u2019s just not as fun to watch. I enjoyed the film far more upon my second viewing. I knew what to expect so I got to enjoy seeing the film instead of hoping for a scene inside my head. Character choices made more sense\\, mysteries from TFA didn\u2019t matter as much\\, and the emotional beats made the story more impactful. I think over time people will enjoy the film for what it is and what it sets up for Episode IX. ","true":true}
