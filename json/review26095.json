Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not only the worst star wars movie ever made but one of the worst movies I've been to in a long time. it's sad when a movie with this much anticipation and funding is really only rent worthy at best.","true":true}
