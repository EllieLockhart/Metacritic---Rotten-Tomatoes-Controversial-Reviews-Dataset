Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a fan for almost 30 years\\, grew up reading the books and basically being obsessed with every little piece of lore I could find. This movie has instantly become my favorite of the entire franchise. It is absolutely amazing!","true":true}
