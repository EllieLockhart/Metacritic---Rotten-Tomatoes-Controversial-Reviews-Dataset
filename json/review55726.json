{"101487":160809,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On its own\\, one of the better\\, if not best star wars so far.\\nBut when placed into the series as a whole\\, some of the parts refused to work with others.\\n\\nPros:\\nExplained the central theme. Finally. after 7 movies\\, and the central theme was never covered properly. In its 8\\, they finally decided to explain the balance of the force. I finally understood that Anakin did brought balance. By murdering both the Jedi and the Sith.\\n\\nBetter Kylo Ren acting. Great job Adam!\\n\\nCharacter development. Poe matured. that's good. Adam took a stand against Snoke. Rey had a break through with her parent issues. Finn.. well\\, just being Finn i guess..\\n\\nNot all plans made by the central characters works. Nice to see Finn and Rose failed in their obviously suicidal attempt... But... TBC\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nSkywalker. Episode 1-6 was about how a skywalker brought balance to the force. 7-9 was to pass the torch to the next generation. and Rey is Nothing?? It's like saying the next generation of harry porter books would see James potter as the new voldermort and some kid from the streets would save the world.. weird.. not sure about you\\, but who tells a story that way??\\n\\nThe force is still being used as thought it is a limitless object. Luke trolled Kylo by using force projection\\, telling Kylo that you can't kill me. The next instance\\, die in a cinematic background. Really Luke? you prefer to die with a backdrop rather than pilot that X-wing and face your nephew? And you use force projection for that?? dude that's just... argh...\\n\\nSo\\, Finn and Rose can run around the galaxy and have a philosophical discussion on war profiteering and slavery\\, and the 1st order cannot sent a crack team of storm troopers. I'm getting way too cinemaSins here.\\n\\nPorgs. Thanks Disney\\, your PR team lead us to believe they serve some purpose.. so Yeah! as a pet.. Maybe you can have a tie in with PETA or sth..\\n\\nConclusion.\\n\\nOn its own\\, it is a good movie. Emotional\\, meaningful\\, and explained the force. But it just refuse to fit with all those that comes before. At some point\\, TLJ and TFA feels more like an EU story\\, and not part of the main saga. ( for those who do not know about EU\\, it is basically used to explain missing plots. Case in pt\\, Jedis do not turn into a force ghost when they die\\, it is not a Jedi technique but a whills one. Basically\\, the gaming industry would call the EU as DLC )","true":true}
