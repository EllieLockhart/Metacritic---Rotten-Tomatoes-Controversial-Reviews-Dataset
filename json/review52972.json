Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Arguably the absolute WORST film in the franchise\\, with only the Force Awakens as its possible rival. Stunning visual effects can't save this film from its atrociously poor storytelling. The story goes much like a young boy telling one fantastic lie after another\\, spurred on by his clueless belief that people buy his bullshit.  There is no way to fix this Shit Trilogy without scrapping most -- if not all -- of it. The new main characters suck. The writing is lazy\\, unimaginative\\, uninspired\\, horrid and awful. The treatment of old\\, beloved characters from the original trilogies are needlessly reduced to weak caricatures or worse\\, nothing that even remotely resembles what they were. The two movies so far are nothing more than merchandising infomercials that should be reduced in status to over-hyped\\, super expensive fan films that made money off a dedicated fanbase.","true":true}
