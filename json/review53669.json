Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me\\, this was one of the best star wars movies for many reasons. \\nFirst\\, it manages to surprise its audience and is one of the most original movies ever. It was preceded by two years of speculations and theories which for other blockbuster movies means that every person with access to the internet knows the whole plot of the movie\\, however the last jedi managed to shock everyone and be completely original\\, it didn't play it safe by making many plot points - subject to many theories - the center of just fan service\\, it gave them a deeper meaning enriching the universe\\, making it more and more realistic rather than a perfect world where the biggest struggles are good vs evil. Where the force awakens played it safe and familiar\\, the last jedi takes it away and shatters everyone's expectation\\, and takes the triology in a very interesting way.\\nSecondly\\, yes i acknowledge that it is darker than previous star wars and makes the hopeful Luke for instance and makes him a secluded jedi suffering from ptsd but this is a good thing for it makes this universe more believable and the characters\\, the heroes and legends\\, more like humans who mess up many times\\, it just gives depth to many features of this universe.\\nFinally\\, Rian Johnson's direction and vision is spectacular. This is a very beautiful movie with a very pretty imagery\\, the action scenes are the best in the series and many of the scenes\\, the jump to hyperspace especially\\, are one of the best shots in movies. Plus the action scenes are really entertaining and beautifully choreographed. Regarding the story\\, it has some flaws\\, but mostly it is an amazing story revolving around survival\\, growth\\, and leaving the past in the past\\, which is a very excellent direction to take the star wars franchise in. Every character has a beautiful arc and everyone does so much more in this movie than they did in the force awakens.","true":true}
