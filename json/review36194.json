Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was not only a disappointing Star Wars movie\\, it was a terrible movie in general. Lazy confused writing\\, useless sub plots\\, a run time that is too long. At the end of the movie it feels like nothing of consequence has happened. The Force Awakens was lazy and plagiarized the original Star Wars film\\, but it least setup some interesting storylines for this movie to expand upon. Unfortunately that never happens with TLJ.\\nOne of the worst movies of 2017 and easily the worst SW film including the prequels. Not excited to see the next installment of this trilogy.","true":true}
