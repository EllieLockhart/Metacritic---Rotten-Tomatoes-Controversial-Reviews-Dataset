Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor plot\\, a lot of wasted opportunity. I am a life long Star Wars fan and have enjoyed all Star Wars films in there own way up until this point. I firstly want to say there was some amazing shots and some interesting idea\\, however this can't save the slow pace and pointless plot elements. I couldn't believe this had such a positive early reaction. I feel cheated and genuinely upset after watching this.  \\n\\nThe handling of certain characters such as fin were so poor they made them feel like there was no point of them still being in the film. \\n\\nOverall the film was ok but for how good the force awakens and rogue one were this to me was a rare miss for all things Disney","true":true}
