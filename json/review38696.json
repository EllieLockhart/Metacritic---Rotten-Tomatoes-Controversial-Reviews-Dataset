Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst writing and storytelling I've ever seen they just slapped cgi and crazy visuals on a turd of a story slapped star wars on it and shoved politics down our throats for 2.5 hours and rian Johnson ruined luke Skywalker lmao rian Johnson is a joke and no true star wars fan like bro jj set u up for the easiest slam dunk of a movie in cenima history and you literally turn and do the opposite.","true":true}
