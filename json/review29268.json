Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rey and Kylo's paralleling plots are the best part of the movie. Finn's story is a throwaway. Laura Dern's character creates unneeded drama for Poe by not revealing she had a plan for escaping and instead acts like a douche. Rose provides a random and shoehorned love interest for Finn. Yoda makes an awkward appearance and breaks the conventions of what the Force can do\\, providing a major plothole in the entire series. Phasma enters just as quickly as she exits. Luke gives a recycled bit of dialogue from Obi-Wan to Kylo. Overall\\, it has its flaws and is rushed kind of like this review\\, but it is enjoyable.","true":true}
