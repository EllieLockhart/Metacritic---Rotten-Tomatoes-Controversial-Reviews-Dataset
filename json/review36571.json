Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie has very little to enjoy about it\\, it's very slow paced and boring. Scenes go on for too long and there's really no hope for a sequel\\, the director really killed the future of this movie franchise","true":true}
