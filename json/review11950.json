Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Huge star wars fan. I'm 40 years old so I've been there from the beginning. The nonsensical\\, goof-off\\, slapstick humor completely ruined it for me. It felt a lot like the prequels because of that. The tone of Rogue One was good and it's one of my favorite in the series. They need to try to stick to that tone. I don't know where Lucasfilm every got the idea that fans want comedy in Star Wars. Is it because Han Solo was sarcastic in the original trilogy and fans loved it? When the OT started to derail with the Ewoks\\, there was fan blow-back. It's crazy to me that Lucasfilm cannot recognize the correlation between poorly acted slapstick moments in Star Wars and fan criticism. Ep 4\\, 5\\, 6\\, 7 and Rogue One have the right formula.","true":true}
