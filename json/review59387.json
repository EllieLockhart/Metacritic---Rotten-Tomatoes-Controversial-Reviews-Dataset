Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game had an almost insurmountable task of following the first\\, but manages to do so in an unexpected and innovative way. Gameplay\\, graphics\\, and sound are as impressive as the first\\, and shows a natural evolution despite some predictable human A.I. The story structure was completely unique. The revenge cliche still feels like a slight drawback\\, but the way it\u2019s done makes it so much more than that. Perhaps even more than the first\\, this is a game of consequences. It\u2019s about different experiences from different perspectives. How Joel\u2019s choices impacted Ellie\u2019s and Abby\u2019s\\, into how Abby\u2019s impacts Ellie\u2019s\\, and how Ellie\u2019s impacts Abby\u2019s. There\u2019s no one to root for in this game\\, and that will leave a bad taste in some peoples mouths. I feel like Ellie killing Abby May have been a more logical ending\\, though it has left me wondering what\u2019s next for these characters. This is a complicated story that will hit each player differently. 9.5\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
