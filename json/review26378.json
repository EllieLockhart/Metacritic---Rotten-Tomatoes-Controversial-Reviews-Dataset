Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not what i expected I thought it was ok\\, but way to Disney. There wasnt even a real Jedi vs Sith lightsaber fight. A projection doesn't count. The directors attempt at creating a force gray zone fell short. Plus you don't feel for the characters as there really was no character development.","true":true}
