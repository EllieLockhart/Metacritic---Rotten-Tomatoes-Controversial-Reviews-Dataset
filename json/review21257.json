Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went into the cinema with really low expectations. But i was not prepared to the abysmal writing of The Last Jedi.\\nTo begin\\, the movie is filled with silly jokes. And I like the jokes in the other SW movies. But here the jokes are place before every serious moment in the movie. \\nPart of the plot revolves around Rey learning the way of the force. And i can go with that. The other part is this absurd idea that for 1.5 hours of the movie the good guys ship is chased by the bad guys. But this is not a hiding running chase like the one in The Empire Strikes Back. Here they just run a little ahead of the bad guys. That keep Shooting to them. For 1 hour. It just does not make sense.\\nBut my undoing was another. There has been a consistency in the star wars univers up until this movie\\, for space battles and how the SW universe looks at space travel and space battle. \\nIn this movie they just cancel all this. \\nBut that's my thing\\, i'm an engineer and I can't stand that crap. the fact is that the movie is so flawed that anybody chan pick their personal reason to dislike it.","true":true}
