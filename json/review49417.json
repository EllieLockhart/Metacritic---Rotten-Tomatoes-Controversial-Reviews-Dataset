Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst SW movie ever created. I can't believe anyone can like this piece of horrible writing and character destruction. It's worse than the worst fanfiction. Ask any SW fan to write a script\\, it would be better than this. Not kidding! Kennedy and Johnson really really messed up on this one. They destroyed beloved characters\\, a whole franchise\\, and its huge worldwide fanbase. I can't believe no one at LucasFilms tried to stop this disaster.\\n\\nWell done\\, Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy. I am done with SW. The saga ends with episode 6. I will never pay for any SW related stuff again. If boycott is what you'll understand\\, then boycott it will be.","true":true}
