Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"bored me to death. was also rather confusing. it wasn't something you'd be upset to miss. 3 hours of mostly filler crap. barely any character development. weak fight scenes. just saw it 2 hours ago and i already forget 70% of what happened.","true":true}
