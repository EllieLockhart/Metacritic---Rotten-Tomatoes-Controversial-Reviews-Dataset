Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many plot holes and disappointing moments to rate this any higher. Leia coming out of space was dumb\\, they took Luke in a bad direction\\, the ship chase that lasted most of the movie was pointless and avoidable\\, and Rey being a nobody is stupid as well. JJ Abrahms has a lot of work to do in episode ix to fill in the gaps and make the story better. ","true":true}
