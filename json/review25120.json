Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never before have i left a theater angry before.  all elements of the story that the force awakens left any true Star Wars fans looking forward to were aptly cast aside in favor of ridiculous plots and virtue-signaling.  \\n\\nThis movie was the worst thing that could have ever happened to the Star Wars universe and one of the biggest missed-opportunities in ours.","true":true}
