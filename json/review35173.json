Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Force is indeed strong with The Last Jedi as it intrepidly ventures outside the traditional Star Wars story structure while maintaining the essential identity of Star Wars.

Abrams is going to follow up this masterpiece.\\\"\\nFull review: http:\/\/filmassessment.blogspot.com\/2017\/12\/star-wars-last-jedi-review.html","true":true}
