Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Any true Star Wars fan cannot get through 5 minutes of this movie without thinking to themselves \\\"why did they do this??\\\". From start to finish it is a complete mess with no depth and it's only saving-grace comes from talented acting of Mark and other returning characters despite a garbage script. Overall\\, this is easily the worst Star Wars movie ever and completely ruins the plot-lines the first movie had developed; even worse it robs you of the excitement for the next movie.","true":true}
