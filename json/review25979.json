Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing was good about this movie. They changed Luke beyond acceptable ways. They answered nothing from the previous film. They subverted expectations to just subvert expectations. So many insane plots that never were explored. I absolutely hated this movie... I have never hated a movie more. They had to try to back off of everything in the next movie that made it awful too.","true":true}
