Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should never had been shown. There is only one reason for it and that is to honor the late Carrie Fisher and that sadly made it impossible to redo. This movie kills all questions and plots from the first movie in a very disrespectful manner. Shame on you Disney to allow such crap to be presented to the Star Wars audience!","true":true}
