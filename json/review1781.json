Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a Star Wars fan\\, this was one of the worst movies\\, it just doesn't respect how Star Wars was made\\, it has a plethora of extremelly dull and political correct characters\\, useless and unimaginative story arcs\\, dissapointing battles\\, little to no use of the droids\\, and terrible character development\\, it doesn't live up to the hype generated by the 7th.","true":true}
