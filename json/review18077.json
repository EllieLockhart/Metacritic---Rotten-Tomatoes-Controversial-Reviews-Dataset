Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It was a major departure from a more predictable plot that I feared this trilogy would go. Am I disappointed that many of the fan theories and predicted plot tools were nullified with this film? A little\\, sure. I had my own theories that were ended by this film\\, and yeah it kind of sucks that I was wrong. But moreso\\, I am gratuitously pleased that I was shocked in this movie\\, that the plot turned in ways I did not foresee\\, and that I truly have no idea how this story will end in the final episode. I am excited for where this film has taken us\\, as we are now in uncharted territory.","true":true}
