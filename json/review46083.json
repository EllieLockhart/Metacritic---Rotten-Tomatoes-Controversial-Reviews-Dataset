Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning is the only positive thing I can say about this movie. It\u2019s too long\\, the plot makes no sense\\, and it has found every way to usher out the staples of the franchise in order to replace them with underwhelming\\, uninteresting\\, characters that seem more like cosplayers than actual actors.","true":true}
