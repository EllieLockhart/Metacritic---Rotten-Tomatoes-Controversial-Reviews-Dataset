Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tied with Phantom Menace for the worst Star Wars film ever created.  The actors did a fine job\\, special effects were on point ... the plot ... my God the plot.  This was the laziest piece of writing I have witnessed.   A story arc that revolves around a slow moving space chase?   Luke Skywalker ... a man made famous for facing evil and refusing to give in ...  contemplates killing his own nephew because of \\\"sensing darkness\\\"\\, comedic villains play acting as if they were adults... it was literally akin to watching children throw tantrums.   What an absolutely wasted opportunity that completely ignored The Force Awakens and every thing that made the original trilogy so great.    Disney has the helm now folks\\, expect every movie to be watered down click bait until they have milked this franchise dry.","true":true}
