Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If the last five minutes of the film had gone a different way\\, I might have very well loved this film. If the character arc for one very beloved character had gone a different way\\, the film for me would have been a near perfect Star Wars joy ride. But much like life\\, we don't always get what we want. And does that truly make it bad? I still don't know how to reconcile (SPOILER) Luke's storyline with the rest of the film. Despite Mark Hamill's stellar performance\\, it is hard to see our heroes fail or leave us. That being said\\, the film does not hold back from making you think\\, and for as much as TFA spoonfed us nostalgia\\, TLJ makes you feel uneasy and question what you know. What is bravery\\, what is the point of rebelling\\, what does it mean to accept and move on from failure\\, when is forgiveness necessary and what is the price we pay for the greater good. It makes you think\\, and that I think is a good thing. But why did TFA leave me pumped full of excitement and new characters to love\\, while this film leaves me poignantly feeling as if it's all slipping away and the world isn't what I thought it was? Maybe it's because as much as episode 7 felt like childhood\\, new and nostalgic all at once\\, this film encapsulates the awkwardness\\, adventure\\, and haphazardness and unpredictability of adolescence. While painful\\, in the long run this stage of a story and of our lives leads to a deeper and more insightful understanding of the world. All  the questioning\\, uncertainty\\, grey areas of the world\\, and goodbyes are worth it. Maybe\\, just maybe\\, episode 9 will leave us with the clarity the comes with growing up and loving the life you have\\, or at the very least finding joy and meaning in it.","true":true}
