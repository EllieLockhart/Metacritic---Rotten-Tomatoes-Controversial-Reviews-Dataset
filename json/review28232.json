Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poorly written\\, many unanswered questions plus some dumb scenes like Luke drinking alien milk\\, leia flying in space. This movie ruined my love for the original star wars cast and story.","true":true}
