Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First you kill Han then you kill Luke?? Maybe it would be tolerable if they died with honor. But no\\, let's kill them like spoiled brats who don't know how to deal with life when it doesn't go your way. I am left flatbedgasted at the amount of diregard they have shown to the fans who loved their old hero.","true":true}
