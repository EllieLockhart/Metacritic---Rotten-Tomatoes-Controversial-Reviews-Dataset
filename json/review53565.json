Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Exciting\\, emotional and epic in every sense of the word\\, \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" is a worthy addition to the beloved franchise. Rian Johnson's sequel to 2015's \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" is everything that Star Wars fans could have possibly hoped for. Featuring dazzling action sequences\\, powerful performances and a heartfelt story\\, it is popcorn entertainment at its finest. In terms of pure spectacle\\, it offers the most breathtaking space battles you will see in a movie this year. No Star Wars fan would be able to resist the spectacle or the engrossing story. That being said\\, the film is not without flaws. Although the film is thoroughly entertaining\\, it suffers from an overlong running time. At nearly 2 and a half hours\\, it occasionally drags and tests the viewer's patience. Nevertheless\\, \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" is a thrilling addition to the franchise. Although I'm not a fan of Star Wars\\, I enjoyed it much more than I expected.","true":true}
