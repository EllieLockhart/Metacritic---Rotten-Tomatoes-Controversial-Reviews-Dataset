Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian and KKKennedy focused on making a movie they thought was good. Rather than the fan idea of what gives it justice to be a decent Star Wars movie.\\n\\nFair enough\\, w\/e they don't care anyway. \\nThe problem is a good movie that continues on after 7 (8) other films in that time line\\, sets the bar pretty high and the fans are a big part of what makes the trilogys successful. They are where the money will flow from. Pissing them off at this point leaves a lot for them to hate\\, and for that SJW trash to tell everyone she wont ever acknowledge the fans. She needs firing.\\nWhen you start blanking what the fans saw as the right things to do in the movie\\, and start treating OT characters like sh*t\\, and then kill them off in lousy ways and forcing them out for the Mary Sue that a lot of girls can't even relate to\\, wtf were you thinking? You even s**t on the 7th movies plots. \\n\\nTrashy Hollywood scumbags. Disney seriously aren't any better at this point. Boycott will also be my option for the new Solo\\, and anything Rian gets his hands on. KK Kenedys new Anime can get fu--ed\\, too. Oh\\, and you probably made that Trashy forcs infinity show\\, i bet? \\n\\nOnly good thing produced so far is SW Rebels.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi failed\\, your highness!","true":true}
