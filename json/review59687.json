The graphics are ok ( but they are not much better from LoA)5. You can ride a horse.Cons1. Plot - I will just skip this point. After chapter 6\\, I had strong desire to turn this game off. I made myself to finish it.2. Game mechanics - they are just the same. 7 years passed - maybe ND could ad something new?3. Level Design - the weakest part of the game. They put so much efforts in creating all this environment\\, but it is completely dull and empty. First open world o location Seattle shows us the whole lack of ideas. Corridors and rooms with enemies. 4. I can not explain why\\, but it is not fun at all to kill infected any more. It is just stupid stealth and that\u2019s it. Melee fights are not fun anymore. It is a big disappointment. It is like Star Wars episode 7 we saw everything before\\, graphics became better. But everything feels completely broken + your favourite characters die. I feel that Druckmann might not be creative director of the studio after this game (\u2026 Expand","true":true}
