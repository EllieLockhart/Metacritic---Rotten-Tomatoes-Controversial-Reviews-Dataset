Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching it twice I still think that it's just a horrible addition to the SW universe and as far a movies goes it has some of the laziest humor\\, on par to Mr. Bean. Not to mention the unnecessary plots\\, the killing off of supposedly major characters without further explanation. And to kill the hero of the universe in such a stupid and lazy manner. It would have been better if Kylo had actually dueled him and won. At least it has cured me of my SW obsession so that's something.","true":true}
