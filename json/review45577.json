Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. Luke deserved better. Massive plot holes. Terrible use of the force as a FaceTime platform. Flying through space. Wasted subplots and characters. Please have more people agree and proof scripts and story directions before. Even if you feel it's formulaic\\, remember it's a formula that works. Star Wars is like a warm glassed milk. It's comfort food.\\nWhat we got was spoiled milk. Don't take too many risks. We want similar movies. Good vs bad. A brave and strong luke. Developed villains. Strong family conflict and ties. I could go on. I was so excited for this film\\, and the more I think about it it's 35 percent good and 65 percent bad. I liked looper. This feels like the first Star Wars I have zero desire to view a second time in the theater.","true":true}
