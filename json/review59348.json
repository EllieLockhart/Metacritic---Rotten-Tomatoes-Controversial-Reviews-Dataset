We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Pros:\r\r1. One of the best looking games I have ever played.\r2. Animations so smooth you might think it's scripted.\r3. Incredible performances.\r4. One of the most polished games I have ever played. Everything just works! No hiccups in gameplay\\, character models\\, animations or environments.\r5. Amazing atmosphere - building. You can really feel the despair\\, anger\\, horror and hopelessness as you travel through this post-apocalyptic world.\r6. I did enjoy the newly introduced RPG element. Picking skills to learn and seeing it come to life in gameplay was always great.\r\rCons:\r\r1. I did not care about Abby or her group of friends no matter how hard the game tried. When you have to play one half of the entire game as a character you just can't find yourself to like\\, the game starts to drag.\r2. The game tried too hard to portray Ellie as the villain (should have been more subtle).\r3. The stealth gameplay (although very polished) is nothing new. Toward the last third of the game\\, I found myself just trying to get through the fight sequences so I can get closer to the end. It's too many tossing bottles\/bricks\\, sneaking up behind an enemy and pressing triangle. And this is coming from somebody who LOVES stealth games. There just were not enough elements to keep me interested.\r4.  Did not care for the supporting cast. They were very forgettable.\r5. TLOU 2 could have benefited from shaving 3-4 hours from the run time. Some sequences felt unnecessary and were clearly only there to force us to connect with Abby more (which the game ultimately failed in).\r\rUnfortunately\\, I do think TLOU 2 was an unnecessary sequel. The devs told us they would not create a sequel unless it was significant and it just fell short.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
