Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hopeless sad movie with no character or plot development . Everything mildly interesting from the force awakens you hoped would be continued or expanded on are completely thrown out the window. This movie feels more like a multi million dollar troll. From characters arcs seemingly moving more backwards than forward as well as a plot that seems to lead nowhere. Everything the characters try to accomplish fails and every time you think something moved forward it was undone one or two scenes later. Pure disappointment.","true":true}
