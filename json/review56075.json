Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many unnecessary side plots. A lot of time spent on side stories and new characters that have no actual relavance in the final grand scheme of things. Especially Laura Derns charcter which could have just been an autopilot function\\, and instead ofall that time to introduce Benecio del Toro\\, why not just make Rose the expert?? A few great shots with a lot of pointless story arcs.","true":true}
