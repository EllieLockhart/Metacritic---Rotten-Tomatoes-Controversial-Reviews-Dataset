Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everyone is going to go into this movie with different expectations. \\n\\nWithout putting any spoilers in\\, there were some parts of the movie that had plot holes and some characters did not develop as well as they should have. There are also parts of the movie where characters take a turn that I was not expecting and\\, in my opinion\\, turned out well. There are many new ideas that develop in this movie that seem like they will be answered in episode IX.\\n\\nThere definitely could have been more improvements\\, but fairly solid film. I did not go in trying to compare it to any previous films.","true":true}
