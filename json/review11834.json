Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How to know if you will like this film.\\n\\nIf you hated episode 7\\, you will hate this movie.\\nIf you liked episode 7\\, there is 50% chance you will hate this movie.\\nIf you love the trilogy and care about the characters\\, you will hate this movie.\\nIf you are a casual movie fan\\, you might like this movie.\\nIf you are a professional critic (bought by disney)\\, you will love this movie.","true":true}
