Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had its moments but overall the tone was too jokie\\, main plot was thin\\, and they didn\u2019t give you more information about ray and snoke. I realize that sometimes in life there isn\u2019t a reveal or a twist but it is Star Wars so in this case not having a middle movie reveal was very disappointing. Overall it works enough that it won\u2019t sink the trilogy but it certainly didn\u2019t leave me saying\\, hot damn\\, now that was a Star Wars movie. ","true":true}
