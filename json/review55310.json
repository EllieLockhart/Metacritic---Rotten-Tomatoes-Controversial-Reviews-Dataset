Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Light spoilers follow\\nA wild seesaw between brilliant highs and hard-to-watch lows\\, The Last Jedi was ultimately disappointing. This wasn't a Star Wars movie\\, part of a universe built on remarkably coherent foundation of rules and expectations. \\nThis was a Star Wars fanfiction\\, cherry-picking world-building components of previous films that could directly translate to an exciting scene and ignoring or blatantly contradicting components that did not. To those quick to assume I have problems with the movie adding a dose of originality\\, I assure you that I do not. However\\, the purpose of writing a story in an established universe is to expand and enrich that universe\\, not fracture it. Granted\\, these issues would appear to be the result of atrocious writing more than a conscious decision\\, given the number of contrived situations we find ourselves forced into to generate dramatic tension. Why\\, for example\\, did the imperial fleet\\, having completely decimated the rebel cruiser's offensive capabilities with a grand total of three fighters\\, not simply continue the fighter assault until the rebellion was destroyed?\\nAs for character arcs\\, one in particular has the dubious distinction of being completely and utterly unnecessary. Producing no worthwhile character development and failing to advance the plot in a meaningful fashion\\, Fin and Rose wasted a lot of time getting into position to setup Poe's own arc. Poe was served much better by the writers\\, however\\, as his arc is nicely nuanced and well executed (excepting the apparently mandatory instance of contrived conflict). I was and remain conflicted about Rey and Kylo's arc. Sections of it were very well done\\, with complex and interesting character development. Other sections came across as far too juvenile\\, with a number of questionable character decisions. \\nOpportunities opened by the previous film seemed largely wasted in this one. The best examples of this are (unfortunately) both Luke and Snoke\\, who feel like they were set up with much greater potential than the movie ultimately used them for. Snoke in particular had a decent scene that felt like it could have been a spectacular one if he had been given the appropriate characterization beforehand.  Luke seemed remarkably maladjusted for a man who spent years constantly communicating with ghost Yoda and Obi-wan.\\nThese problems don't mean that the movie is terrible\\, as it's not. It is a perfectly entertaining few hours of laser swords and telekinesis in space. It just isn't a good Star Wars movie.","true":true}
