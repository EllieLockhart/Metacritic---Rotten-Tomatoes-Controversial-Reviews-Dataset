Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The resistance forgot to fuel up at the last Marathon station. Movie fails to answer questions from previous movie. Poor taste\/forced comedy that would better fit in Spaceballs than Star Wars. A 30-45 side plot that adds nothing of benefit to the story. ","true":true}
