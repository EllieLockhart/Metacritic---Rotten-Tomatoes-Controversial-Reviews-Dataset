Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love this movie. Sometimes the humor may not work as expected but as a package\\, The Last Jedi it's a great movie.There are many unexpected turns and storylines that are really interesting and it expands the ways of the force in a great way. There are expeccional performances like Mark Hamill's and the direction is beautiful.Rian Johnson made an awesome movie","true":true}
