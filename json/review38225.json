Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The visuals and the performance of some of the actors are about the only positive things about the movie\\, which seems to try really really hard to subvert the audience expectations\\, to the point where it collapses under its unnecessary long screentime and illogical decisions.","true":true}
