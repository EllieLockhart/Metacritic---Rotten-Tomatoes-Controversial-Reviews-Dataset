Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Much better the second time around\\, had to sit with it for a while. When I first saw it\\, it had been a while since I watched episode 7. After learning about all the easter eggs and references\\, it was a much better viewing experience on the second viewing.","true":true}
