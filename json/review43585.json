Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not a good movie. I have usually felt pretty comfortable going to see 90%+ RT movies but I have serious questions how the score could be so high with the major issues this film had.","true":true}
