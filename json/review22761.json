Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Literally the very first thing you see on the screen in every Star Wars episode are the words \\\"A long time ago in a galaxy far\\, far away....\\\" So why is the film loaded with topical \\\"humor\\\" and infected with 21st century earth feminist\/social justice propaganda? This is supposed to be entertainment\\, isn't it? \\n\\nLeftists do not want any \\\"safe spaces\\\" from their propaganda. From Obama urging people to talk about his healthcare plan at the Thanksgiving dinner table to Starbucks attempting to make buying an overpriced coffee an \\\"opportunity to talk about race\\\"\\, to the NFL kneelers and Hollywood awards shows becoming unapologetic Democrat Party tent revivals\\, there is no rest from their propagandizing. It's incessant. It's what leftists all over the world do - bathe the public in propaganda 24\/7\/365 to sell their revolutions.\\n\\nI RESIST.","true":true}
