Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am just so disappointed in the lack of Disney not trying to meet their fans expectations. The movie does not answer hardly any questions at all the one question it does answer did not fulfill my Star Wars needs. I hate this movie is now cannon. ","true":true}
