Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Story is not original. Johnson just mixed Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi. I found it predictable and drags with its side stories.\\nBenicio del Toro and Gwendoline Christie were under used.\\nThe light sabre fights were horrible. The Prequels stand as the best light sabre choreography and best original stories compared to these last 2 SW entries in to the space saga.","true":true}
