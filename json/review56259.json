Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi is the longest Star Wars film and is extremely different! Well done by director Rian Johnson! Fans are overreacting to the change and you should definitely take the time to go see this film. However\\, there is a specific moment in the film where you follow the new character \\\"Rose\\\" with Finn to save their friends; the entire segment we spend with Rose and know more about her\\, you end up not caring\\, however. She was amongst one of the most annoying characters next to Ewoks and Jar Jar. As well with the other new characters we're introduced\\, they're flat out terrible; except for this hacker guy who had potential\\, but is thrown away. I personally HATED the two rebel admiral characters (specifically the purple hair one)\\, they are easily forgettable and you don't care for them in the end\\, easily replaceable by anyone. The moments you spend with Luke and Rey are the best moments about this film along with the twists\\, action scenes and humor. The overall story itself is a bit of a drag at times and lacks a continuous flow\\, because you have to deal with so many areas at once and not to mention this takes place RIGHT AFTER episode 7. A lot of things could've been changed\\, but this film is given WAY TOO MUCH HATE for being bold and different in the wrong ways. The issue with all of these Star Wars Movies is the political agenda that should end.","true":true}
