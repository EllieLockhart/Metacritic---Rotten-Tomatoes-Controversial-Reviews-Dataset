Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unfortunately the saga is heading in the wrong direction. Star Wars has never been known for its acting but the story has always been solid. The character development is terrible and predictable. I understand the need to usher in a new and younger cast\\, but why completely destroy the old\\, it seems they could have been a good supporting presence. Not enough darkness and too many cheesy scenes. The rebel series on Disney channel has better dialogue and back story. IMO. ","true":true}
