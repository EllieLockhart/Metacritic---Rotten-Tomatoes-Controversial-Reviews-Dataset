Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It started looking like the same old story of the apprentice\\nlooking for the master\\, but then Rian Johnson  starts a grass fire and\\, as it finds fuel\\, everything starts to burn. \\n\\nGood\\, it needed to happen. In 3 minutes the mydochlorian  bs is refuted. Like shows the flaws in the understanding of the Jedi religion and here in the real world the crap writing in the prequels suddenly gains a purpose. \\n\\nComplete with Jungian\/Campbell archetypes and symbolism. Rian Johnson destroyed Star Wars and rebuilt it from the ashes.","true":true}
