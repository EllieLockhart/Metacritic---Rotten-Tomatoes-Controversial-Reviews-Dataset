Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to enjoy this movie. This movie was a parody of a star wars movie. The director movie tryed so hard to swerve every fans expectations that i literally asked my friend multiple times \\\"are they trying to troll us? What is this?\\\" I get the director wanted to make the movie his own \\, but i feel he purposely subverted the expectations of die hard fans. Which is the reason so many people are upset and will not pay money to see episode 9. Why should anyone care about episode 9\\, personally i have no investment into any of the characters. All the characters \\,except kylo\\, with(wasted)potential have been killed. The questions that i had after watching the force awakens  are still completely unanswered and it irks the shit outta me.\\n*  How did the most optimistic and fearless kid in the universe turn into a old\\, scared\\, shell of himself coward?\\n*  Who is snoke and where did he come from? how is he so strong?\\n*  Why does it seem that the events of the OT were pointless?\\n* Why did Phasma get so much hype?\\nThese are just a few of the questions\\, but there are many more. I have no respect for a franchise that now cares more about trolling its diehard fans than it does making its films a cohesive saga.  I hope if you havent seen the movie yet you dont have to pay to see it. Watch it for free or not at all. I will not be paying to watch episode 9  and i hope you dont either.","true":true}
