Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As soon as Luke tossed the Light Sabre over his shoulder I had had enough. The plot seemed to hinge around a really important rebel ship running out of fuel - but by the end I didn't care what it was about. It's like they've jumped to the bloated third film (e.g. Return of the Jedi) and missed out the great sequel (e.g. Empire Strikes Back). It's too long by 150 minutes (the Star Wars title sequence saved it). Most of it makes no sense\\, the \\\"jokes\\\" are too many and too often and don't work\\, and the Las Vegas in space sequence was a total waste. Rey spent way too long on the island nothing in particular and that cheesy kiss at the end - doh.","true":true}
