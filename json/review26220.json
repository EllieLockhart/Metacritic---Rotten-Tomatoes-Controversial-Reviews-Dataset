Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure why all the critics liked this movie. Battle scenes horrible. Unmemorable characters. Plot horrible. Rogue one was the best movie by far. This was by far the worst. Wow\\, still could not believe how bad this movie was. So disappointed. ","true":true}
