Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best movie since The Force Awakens.  I love how we get to watch Kylo Ren evolve into a villain. It doesn't come natural to him.  He's a 1\/4 of who his grandfather was. I love his internal conflict\\, Rey's too as she is tempted by the dark side. If K.Ren is right about who her parents are then this could mean that anyone can have the force\\, not necessarily genetic\\, just like the Oliver Twist-esque child in the last scene (unless we find out Rey gave up her baby).  Yes the yoda scence is  terrible. Like and Princess L seem to have more than the force in this stories-super hero powers-that is bad but can be over looked.  They made Rose look like an Ewok and is a terrible character .  I'd write more but the mobile app isn't easy to type in.  In short\\, watch it and develop your own opinions.","true":true}
