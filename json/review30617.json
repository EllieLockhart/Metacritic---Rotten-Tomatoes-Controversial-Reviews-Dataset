Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply bad writing. Plot and characters arcs were an absolute mess. Individual action sequences were good\\, but there was so many plot holes it was hard to not laugh. Meanwhile their attempts at humour fell flat\\, story had no depth and seemed out of kilter with star wars universe. He's a decent director\\, but think his ego got in the way of this one. Script should have been written by a real writer that knew what he was doing. ","true":true}
