Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s amazing\\, I love this movie and no one can tell me otherwise\\, I can see some of the mistakes made and why people complain! But it still is so awesome and has some of the best scenes in all the saga\\, don\u2019t listen to the negative reviews!","true":true}
