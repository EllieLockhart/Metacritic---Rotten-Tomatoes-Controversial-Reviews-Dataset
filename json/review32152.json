Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER WARNING:\\nMark Hamill said it best\\, \\\"Remember kids it's not important if it's of high quality\\, only if it makes money.\\\"\\nNow the film is certainly of high visual quality.  The direction  and acting are also well done.  My problems are with the story.  I guess that destroying Star Killer base did little to damage the First Order because they are still able to nearly wipeout the Resistance\/Rebels.  Most of the film is a slow race to test the fuel economy of Resistance spaceships.  Finn and Rose going looking for a guy that has a skill that is evidently so common that any random prisoner can accomplish it.  Rey's parents?  Don't ask.  Captain Phasma\/Asthma runs out of breath before a real fight can begin.  Poe is intentionally kept in dark about escape plans so he can get many Resistance\/Rebel fighters killed.   The very end of the movie would have been so epic IF one of the greatest cinematic heroes of the last 30 years were actually physically THERE!\\nI hate the thought of Luke dying alone on that island.  This new trilogy has painted Han Solo as a dead beat and Luke Skywalker as a failure right before taking them out.  \\nI feel as if I lost an old friend without having the chance to say goodbye and even the warmth of the twin suns won't help.","true":true}
