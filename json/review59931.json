The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Absolutely hated it\\, unfortunately. For the amount of time they had\\, they could have come up with a better story. I wanted to give a good review\\, but I just can\u2019t. When I was playing Abby I just wanted to kill myself\\, and eventhough the graphics were really cool with some new addictions gameplay-wise\\, I just\\, for the life of me\\, couldn\u2019t enjoy playing. The only part I did enjoy was fighting off the seraphites\\, they were challenging and they were interesting. Everything else did not make sense. I have a lot of examples but these are just some that pissed me off:\r1. What\u2019s the deal with this game and pregnancy? First there\u2019s Dina but then\\, there\u2019s this other pregnant  lady.... You have a camp full of strong people\\, eager to fight and ready to do it. In what world would you let (and want btw) a pregnant woman\\, that is almost giving birth judging by the size of her belly\\, to go in search of supplies when you know you have enemies nearby also ready to fight? You\u2019re not just putting yourself and your baby in danger\\, but also your entire crew. It\u2019s just one very unnecessary responsibility.\r2. Why were there flashbacks within flashbacks? That\u2019s just poor storytelling. You could have told the same story without all those in between.\r3. I felt manipulated into liking Abby\\, which did not work for me. Yes\\, she likes dogs. Yes\\, she likes children and she feels bad for dead pregnant women. So what? I do too\\, but that does not necessarily  make me a good person. Nor a likable one.\r4. Ellie. She feels so different. I know she is all grown up now\\, but she lost all the witiness from the first game. She was so fun to play with and she felt very one dimensional\\, and angsty (not in a good fun way) in this game.\r5. I knew Joel was going to die. I don\u2019t mind his death being very painful to watch because I knew it would be. I honestly just don\u2019t understand how the events worked out. In the first game\\, you have a scene where Joel sees a man pretending to be injured. He is in a car with Ellie and without talking to the man or leaving the car\\, he KNOWS that it is an ambush. How can the same man be so reckless in a house full of armed strangers? I just can\u2019t deal with the illogical character developments. It\u2019s only been 5 years and you\u2019re telling me that he changed so much to start giving out his name to random people knowing full well what he did to the fireflies? It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\rHonestly\\, I could spend more time ranting about this game but I am tired. This game made me feel tired and frustrated. I play to enjoy myself and that didnt happen at all. If you wanted a gut wrenching game\\, then you should have done it correctly. I am sorry but the graphics did not do it for me. Yes they\u2019re gorgeous but when everything is so bleak and so badly told I just can\u2019t bring myself to enjoy it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
