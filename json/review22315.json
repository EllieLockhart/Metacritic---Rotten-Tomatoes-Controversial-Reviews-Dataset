Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi is just a bad movie\\, there are so many things wrong with this movie \\, the best way to describe it is .....think of Indians Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull ! Wow what a huge disappointment for a great franchise. ","true":true}
