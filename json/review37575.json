{"101487":178380,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-22","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is a significant difference between inventive story telling\\, an straight up getting a character to do something integrally against their character for the sake of a plot\\, only the least informed fans would tolerate.\\n\\nI honestly have to wonder if Rian Johnson has ever watched the original trilogy or experienced any of now non-cannon expanded universe. We should have latched onto Mark Hammil's early concerns when he voiced them. You can't blame the man\\, if everything behind the scenes was flowing one way and there was no fan support. We should have listened.\\n\\nI've seen people call the fan reaction childish etc. But lets get one thing straight. I feel sorry for these people that their empathy is so limited\\, that they cant comprehend how important this is to some people. People have their lives impacted significantly by a book\\, an album\\, maybe a sport\\, for millions it was star wars. An yeah there may be other factors. But with billions leading their lives by a book written 100's of years after an event 2000 years ago\\, I think we can stretch to imagine how the original characters may be important to people.\\n\\nAn lets look at it in context. This is not George Lucas finishing his long held vision. Disney decided to throw that out. We may never know. This is a dude who was 4 when the movie was released effectively retconning a 40 year established franchise with 8 movies\\, countless games and books\\, purely because he can.\\n\\nThis is a man\\, who didn't think it was believable that Lando would turn up to see what the craic was after Han Solo's son murdered him\\, so left him out. \\n\\nSpoilers ahead:\\nTo again place this in context\\, rian gives no explanation as to where the hell Mon Mothma is\\, or Lando\\, or Wedge\\, or why the republic seems to have no military force while the first order has equipment more advanced than the empire.\\n\\nBut did think it was appropriate and conducive to the plot yo have beloved Admiral Ahkbar turn up\\, not have explained as to why Leia is now a higher rank than him and then be unceremoniously sucked out into space to die. The icing on the cake\\, no one even mentions specifically his death. The main man from a race of aliens that the rebellion could not have happened without\\, while they are in a space ship built by his people\\, an no one even laments his death.\\n\\nIts a shame\\, as they do a 10\/10 job of bringing us back into Star Wars. But the story and character interactions are trash. \\n\\nA new Character called Rose\\, i believe plot wise inserted during this second film to try ensure reliable ticket sales in the asian market\\, is placed in from nowhere\\, stops finn saving the rebellion himself\\, and is saved by rose in a rescue so dangerous\\, in real life\\, that they would both be dead. Yet Finn\\, despite having been moments ago convinced he must sacrifice himself for the greater good. Is not even upset about this and immediately falls in love with the young rose\\, seemingly forgetting any romantic feelings he had for Rey. Hey Disney\\, I know you are used to writing fairy tales\\, but even in star wars\\, this isn't how feelings work.\\n\\nI could go on. Visually\\, and creating the world of star wars. This is amazing\\, we are right back there. But in the context of the star wars saga story\\, total trash and disservice\\, more damaging to the star wars narrative than the phantom menace. An immense disappointment compared to last years rogue one.   \\n\\nIf like me\\, you were either there when it started or you are young enough that star wars has always been\\, an you've always been a fan. You are going to hate this film. Considering we had films with ewoks & gungans\\, its incredible to actually be able to call this pop star wars\\, this is star wars for those who don't really care about star wars.\\n\\nOw yeah\\, shove your Porgs.","true":true}
