Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Note to Kathleen Kennedy:  This film is a disgrace. To turn something as precious and pure as Star Wars into a platform for your personal ideology and a middle finger to diehard fans is execrable. \\n\\nYou've slandered a childhood hero of mine who least deserved it\\, squandered the abundant narrative potential of TFA\\, and turned me off to Star Wars forever. \\n\\nIt isn't necessary to devalue and marginalize men in order to elevate women. Yet this film does so again and again\\, along with purposely destroying a legitimate (male) hero\\, Luke Skywalker. \\n\\nYou and your cronies at LucasFilm make me embarrassed to be a woman. Disney and LucasFilm won't be getting another dime from my family as long as you're in residence there.","true":true}
