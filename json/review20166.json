Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was OK at best. This new trilogy has a major villain problem. All of the rebels feel more skilled\/powerful than their imperial counterparts. None of the villains are particularly threatening and that diminishes the feeling of the stakes being high.","true":true}
