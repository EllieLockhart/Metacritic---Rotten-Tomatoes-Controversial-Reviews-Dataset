Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was horrible. Star Wars turned from sci-fi to comedy. Also the plot is meaningless. There isn't a single thing of the movie that I liked. It's clear that Disney is trying to sell the movie to the kids\\, and to sell toys with the new fluffy animal. \\nPoe and Finn are completely useless in regards of the plot. If they have 't been in the movie it wouldn't have changed a thing for the overall plot\\, they have been just an annoying filler for Rey's training.\\nThere would be so much to say but I don't want to do spoilers for who didn't saw the movie.","true":true}
