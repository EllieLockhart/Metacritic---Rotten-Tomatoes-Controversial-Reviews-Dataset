{"101487":129314,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a die-hard Star Wars fan and have been since I was a kid in 1977. I was a wide-eyed six year old child who was swept away seeing the original Star Wars (A New Hope) and 40 years later\\, I was a wide-eyed 46 year old child who was swept away by The Last Jedi. While I really liked this film\\, save for one scene of which we\u2019ll get to\\, I understand the fan backlash. Nobody likes change and The Last Jedi is all about change. That and the internet is flush with gut reacting authorities on everything these days. I think that this film will be looked upon in later years as one of the more important Star Wars chapters. Everyone has said that Rian Johnson has killed Star Wars. Well\\, the same thing was said about the Star Wars creator himself when the prequels came out. Granted\\, The Phantom Menace is the worst of the bunch but it still plays an integral part of the Star Wars lore. Nothing has been killed nor destroyed. If anything\\, it has grown to incorporate new worlds. The galaxy is not just Tattoine and Degobah. It\u2019s vast and we are just now discovering it. The Last Jedi\\, to me\\, is the official changing of the character guard. The iconic characters that we all grew up with are now gone and there is a new group of hero\u2019s on the way. Again\\, people don\u2019t like change and as a result\\, don\u2019t like this film. That\u2019s not to speak for everyone but that is a big part of it. Rian Johnson has taken us to a new part of the galaxy and introduced us to new hero\u2019s\\, new villain\u2019s\\, new creatures\\, new landscapes and new adventures. I believe that the last two years have allowed so many Star Wars theories to take over and when answers were given i.e. Snoke and Rey\u2019s lineage\\, said theorists didn\u2019t take too kindly to the result. Oh well. They are just characters who have their own stories for us to discover. For the Jedi and the Sith to essentially hog the ways of the Force only to themselves in a galaxy filled with millions of creatures to show utter arrogance over one power that is available to all. This film says\\, hey anyone can be Force sensitive. The one flaw I did find in this film was the Leia flying through space scene. It felt and looked very Guardians of the Galaxy-esque to me. I understand that the theme is she is extremely strong with the Force and can do many things but this just felt\\, rushed and overplayed. We all loved Star Wars as kids and will always look to the original trilogy as part of our childhood. And when our childhood heroes are shaken up\\, we tend to get defensive. Look at it like this. When we were kids\\, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were the best! The best! As we grew older and our pallets changed\\, we still longed for that original peanut butter and jelly. Well\\, The Last Jedi\\, changed the jelly a little bit and a lot of people don\u2019t like the taste but in the end\\, it\u2019s still peanut butter and jelly. Bottom line\\, this is a great film and I can\u2019t wait to see how J.J. Abrams completes this triology\u2026\u2026..","true":true}
