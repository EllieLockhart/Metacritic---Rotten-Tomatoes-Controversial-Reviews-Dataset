Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing film!!! Fantastic acting from the entire cast. I love Kylo Ren\\, he is a suberb actor. Wonderful scenes\\, and unexpected surprises. I didn't like Master Yoda... He looked shorter\\, skinner and moved weird. I enjoy the Yoda from the newer Anakin & Padme movies. I also didn't like the fact that I waited 2 years to find out who's Rey parents are\\, and for nothing because they still don't tell you ??. I thought Luke Skywalker was her father...... That would have been awesome.... To continue the legacy..... The ending throws all this legacy in the garbage\\, when more little children are Jedi's. What Jedi is impregnating women???? However these bad points are not enough to destroy the movie. The movie is well deserved of its 5 stars! I wish if they gave more lines to C3PO & R2D2..... They focused too much on BB8..... The older bots are wayyyyyyy better........ My ultimate favorite parts was when Rey was fighting next to Kylo Ren - if they are not related\\, then hopefully they can fall in love..... And my other favorite part was when Chewy was cooking the birds and trying to eat.... Chewy is so adorable. Over all it was a fantastic film.","true":true}
