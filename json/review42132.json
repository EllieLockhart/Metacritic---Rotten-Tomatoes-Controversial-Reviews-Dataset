Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie ruined my childhood and the entire Star Wars series. 2.5 hours of boredom. Nameless\\, faceless side characters who don't belong on a television screen\\, much less in a movie\\, much less a Star Wars movie\\, take leadership over  suspineless and seemingly powerless leadership. The plot \\nheld together about as well as a grilled cheese sandwich. \\nI never thought I would say this but\\, I miss George Lucas.","true":true}
