Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loaded with badly placed humor and lack luster story telling. Most major scenes are trivialized by snarky comments and quips and the character development arks are ridiculous.","true":true}
