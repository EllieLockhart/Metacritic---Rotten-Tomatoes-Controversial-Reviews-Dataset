Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was really anxious to see it and get some answers from questions I left TFA with and was disappointed with what was answered or what was completely skipped. There was so much that could of been done to freshen up the saga\\, but instead they spent time with jokes and plot holes (i.e.If jumping to lighspeed does so much damage to ships\\, why wouldn't they just kamikaze X-wings??? Does every Stormtrooper\/janitor know the weakness of the top secret ships and weapons??? ). \\n\\nMaybe things will be explained in the next movie\\, but honestly it'll be too late by then. They killed off great characters and left boring ones. Spent a lot of time with story arcs that really didn't add too much to the story(casino scenes). \\n\\nWhen I first left the theater I thought that the movie was good\\, but didn't like where the story was going. Now the more I think of it\\, the more I find it wasn't.","true":true}
