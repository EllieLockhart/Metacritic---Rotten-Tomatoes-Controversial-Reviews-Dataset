Music is great overall\\, but some of the songs are lacking a little bit of strength and personality\\, that's not to say that the sound package is not impressive... in fact\\, i think this is one of the best sound designs of the year without a doubt.\r\rGameplay 8.5: All the systems works wonderfully\\, melee combat is very brutal and engaging\\, the interactions with the environment while fighting are breath taking. The shooting system feels great overall and the fact that bullets are so rare makes it it feel like a luxury to shoot one. Stealth is very satisfactory because level design makes every combat feel like a sandbox where you can get creative. The only problem for me is that sometimes\\, the repetitiveness of the game loop can be a little too pronounced\\, i wish there were more set pieces or moments where gameplay changes a little bit... in a 12 hour adventure (like the first game) this is not a problem\\, but in a 24 hour one\\, it can get a little too repetitive at times.\r\rStory 8.0: I can see why a lot of people don't like the story\\, a lot of parts in the game are hard to watch and play... but i just can't stop thinking this: At last! we have a good true tragedy video game! this is a step forward to the industry\\, i'm very happy to see video game studios trying to expand narrative to new horizons.\rWith that said\\, the execution has it's flaws\\, the structure of the story can get a little confusing and negatively affect the pacing at times\\, and there are one or two things that failed to be completely believable to me because some characters are\\, well... a little out of character.\r\rThis game is fantastic in every sense\\, i respect so much the approximation of the story and the message\\, it was risky but for me it paid off entirely.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
