Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For Disney\\, Star Wars is a usefull toy to play with. Star Wars was a story\\, now is a commodity.  There is no balance between the characters\\, the force \\\"is a energy that runs trough everything\\\"\\, and also a funny statement to repeat until your ears bleed. \\nHow to destroy a beautiful story about justice\\, fear and power? Let the kids play with it\\, let them repeat the most memorable images and phrases\\, let them introduce funny characters they could later sell as adorable puppets\\,  let them kill one by one all your heroes.","true":true}
