{"101487":169590,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-20","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILER WARNING\\n\\nResistance Escape from D'Qar: Great exciting opening scene showing that Poe has a tendency to shoot first without thinking of the consequences. This laid the groundwork for some character evolution to a leadership position. It also really have the feeling of desperation as it shown the overwhelming odds with a small Resistance Fleet versus the large might of the First Order. \\nWe saw first-hand the conflict within Ben Solo when he sensed his mother on the bridge of the Raddus and refused to fire upon it. I totally thought the destruction of the bridge and the command staff were going to be how the explained away the death of Carrie Fisher. I am seeing a lot of people complaining about Space Leia though. Many people don't know that in the vacuum of space a person can survive for several minutes. After about 15 seconds one would lose consciousness due to the lack of oxygen\\, however you could survive for a few minutes before actually dying from asphyxiation or the effects of the pressure reduction. This does not take into account two important factors; Leia is Force-senstive and we do not know the extent of her powers\/strength (she is a Skywalker after all) and also... it's a movie. Death of Ackbar though\\, ouch.\\nThat emo kid Luke Skywalker: So the entire time that Luke was refusing to train Rey bitching about the Jedi all I could think was \\\"GREY GREY GREY\\\" and he kind of alluded to the existence of eventual \\\"Grey Jedi.\\\" It case you are unaware\\, in the Expanded Universe they were a group of Force-users who walked the line between the light and dark sides of the Force. They used both sides without being corrupted by either. Luke further addressed this when he explains the failure of the Jedi (i.e. the rise of the Empire) and explains that the light and the dark both exist in a balance. Luke also explains the importance of not glorifying the past and holding up legends as they are never as perfect as we think them to be. On another note\\, I am curious to how Ben would have turned out if Luke had not failed. Also\\, I want to see the Knights of Ren\\, who we learn were other Jedi students Ben took with him after destroying the Temple. The Force is life and not the Jedi nor the Sith. Light cannot exist without dark\\, and without dark there is no light. Light and dark as good and evil is ideological. \\nAnd Yoda... HECK YES! (P.S. He was a freaking puppet!!!! How awesome was that!?) In all honestly\\, I think this was my favorite part of the movie\\, and not because of nostalgia. Yoda played more into the thought the sometimes old things must die and we can not hold on to old ideals just because they are there and must challenge our beliefs and learn from our failures.\\nVice Admiral Ellie Sattler:  I really liked her character\\, and damn did she look good too. We\\, as viewers\\, are used to having the plans of the good guys explained to us\\, as apparently Poe is used to also. I didn't like her at first because I thought\\, as did Poe\\, that she had no plan. We are not always privy to all the information. This paid off when Poe learned she did this to allow the Resistance escape to fight another day. This showed him sometimes you can't just fight\\, but have to run. However\\, that being said\\, think about how it was the fault of Poe\\, Finn\\, and Rose that ruined that plan and brought the First Order to their doorstep. This film is sprinkled with failure everywhere; Luke's failure of Ben\\, Poe's failure to take command\\, Finn & Rose's failure to shut off the tracking system\\, and Rey's failure to turn Ben back to the light.\\nThe escape of the smaller transports reminded me a little of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica with the small weaker fleet running from the larger more powerful one\\, however there was far more tension in BSG than here.\\nFinn\\, Rose\\, and DJ: Where I really liked Finn in The Force Awakens I was a little indifferent to him here. His entire character development from TFA where he was a stormtrooper only wanting to run to the man who stood up to Kylo Ren with a lightsaber seemed to be thrown away at first with him just wanting to run again. Add that with his \\\"Chrome Dome\\\" remark\\, I found him underwhelming this time around. Also... Chrome Dome?! Really?? I cringed at that part.\\nAlso\\, can we talk about how useless Phasma has been between these two movies? I'm going to say it\\, more useless than Jar Jar Binks. I'm sure they had great plans for her\\, but her character could have been any number of people. A random Imperial Officer\\, a random Stormtrooper with an orange pauldron\\, literally anyone. Nope\\, we can sell more toys with a shiny stormtrooper with a cape... NO CAPES! In the Force Awakens her only role was to deactivate the shield on Starkiller Base. Any brainwashed loyal soldier would have said \\\"nope\\, you can kill me\\, but I will never betray...\\\" but nope\\, not Phasma. Here uselessness continues here where her roll could have been filled by anyone else. Also\\, I don't think she died in that fiery explosion. The odds of her return are directly proportional to how many toys they think they can sell. \\nRose was awesome. I loved her character and minus her stopping Finn from destroying the Battering Ram Cannon\\, I thought she rocked. I understand she wanted to save him\\, but sometimes the needs of the many outweigh... what? wrong franchise? whatever\\, it applies here. However it does lay the groundwork of the message that it's not just the bad guys who do all the killing\\, but it's the good guys too. Which brings us to DJ who sums up the films as well as real life with two thoughts; \\\"Good guys\\, bad guys... made up words. They blow you up today\\, you blow them up tomorrow.\\\" This is something that is never really addressed.\\nIs Snoke really Darth Maul? They're both the same height after a lightsaber: The scene with Ben presenting Rey to Snoke mirrored Return of the Jedi where Vader was presenting Luke to Palpatine. I really liked how Snoke was watching Ben's mind as he turned his own lightsaber to disguise him turning Anakin's as well. Then Snoke was dead\\, I really expected that for the third film. After the fight scene with the guards I really thought Ben was turning back to the light and didn't really expect him to go at odds with Rey\\, and there was a sliver of me that thought she might go bad (at least until the next film). I think that before this there was hope for Ben\\, but now he is completely lose to the dark side.\\nOn another note\\, something unresolved that is still really bugging me... who the hell was Snoke. We know he was a being who witnessed the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire. And in this film we learn he is a power dark side user\\, however after that we still know nothing.\\nOverheard Projection Luke: I enjoyed the Battle of Crait. The destruction of the First Order fleet by Holdo was amazing. Once you see the Resistance get to the planet you really get a sense of their desperation at this point\\, especially after their distress call goes out and you learn no one cares. I really wasn't expecting Luke to be a Force projection. I thought he just cut his hair and got a change of clothes (I really like that costume too) and thought that when the walkers opened fire on him he used the Force to deflect the blasts. The first thing I did notice was he had Anakin's lightsaber\\, but at first I thought it was a mistake\\, however on the second viewing I noticed that where everyone else left footprints of red when they walked\\, he left nothing further showing he wasn't really there. As for the death of Luke\\, I was content with it. I assume it was simply that the projection took a lot out of him and he was now finally content and at peace with the force. I really liked the bookending of his story where you open on Luke in A New Hope staring off into the twin suns on Tatooine and end here in The Last Jedi staring off into the twin suns of Ahch-To.\\nOverall I really enjoyed The Last Jedi and can't wait for the next one... the next one being Episode IX\\, I really don't care about Solo (however I will see it opening weekend).","true":true}
