Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thank You Disney you some how managed to ruin Star Wars one of the worst ones yet where nothing makes sense. More questions than answers and shitting all over the original trilogy and it's characters. Some things should not be messed with to begin with. Lucas Should of never sold the rights. Once again Disney proves they are only after one thing and that is money. Way to screw the fans 2 years for this crap. You should be ashamed Disney. #TheLastJedi #DisneySucks","true":true}
