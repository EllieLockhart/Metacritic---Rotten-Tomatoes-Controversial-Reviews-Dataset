Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My review was too in-depth so RT won't post it. I worked for like an hour an a half too. I'll shorten it up. Far too bloated with unnecessary characters\\, characters aren't that interesting\\, lack of drama\\, manufactured stakes\\, no love or emotion\\, terrible pacing\\, Luke is wishy-washy and grumpy. I'm not gonna write all this out again. some day ill post my full review and link it here or something like that","true":true}
