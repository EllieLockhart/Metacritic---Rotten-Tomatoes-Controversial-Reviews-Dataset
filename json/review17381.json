Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw it in an 2nd run theatre for $4 - still wasn't worth the money!  Rave reviews remind me of \\\"the Force Awakens\\\" - J.J. Abrams was a genius who made the movie...he's brilliant\\, yada-yada-yada.  Yeah? Then why didn't he direct the sequel?  The real answer is both movies SUCKED!!! Since Disney took over\\, they completely destroyed what lucas had built.   I gave it a half star\\, but that was only because it wouldn't let me rate it any lower","true":true}
