Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was excellent and I do not understand all the hate it receives.  It Honored the original Trilogy but also brought fresh twists.  This movie had me from start to finish.  Everything about it was great.  I cannot praise this movie enough.  If you havnt seen it yet\\, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?! Go see it.","true":true}
