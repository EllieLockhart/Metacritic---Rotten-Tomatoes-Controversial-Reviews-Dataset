Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was different than every other Star Wars movie I\u00e2(TM)ve seen. It was so hyped up but in the end I felt the director really just wanted to throw off all the viewers. It makes me wonder where this is going. Is it just the rebels vs. the bad guys again but killing off all the classic characters? Is Kylo even bad? Why is Rey so strong with the force? Hoping all is resolved in the last movie.","true":true}
