{"101487":142598,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-04-12","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's been two years since Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released in theaters to enormous fan hype and one of the highest box office revenues in history. It set up a promising future for the Star Wars of a new generation. Enter its follow-up\\, The Last Jedi\\, directed by Looper's Rian Johnson and starring The Force Awakens' ensemble cast. It is another exciting ride through the galaxy far\\, far away\\, one that is just as satisfying as its predecessor but not executed quite as smoothly.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi picks up right where The Force Awakens left off\\, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) meeting Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) for the first time and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) leading the rebellion in a retreat from the First Order\\, which is led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). All of the characters from the previous film make their return to the Star Wars universe\\, including the four I previously mentioned\\, as well as Poe (Oscar Isaac)\\, Finn (John Boyega)\\, Chewbacca\\, BB-8\\, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels)\\, R2-D2\\, and\\, of course Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Now\\, several of these characters are given interesting story arcs\\, and I'll briefly talk about a few of them. The first most obvious one is Rey's arc\\, in which she travels to the isolated island to train with Luke and the audience learns more about Luke's backstory and finds out why he is a broken man who has lost faith in the Jedi. I thought Hamill did a good job in the film (though maybe not in the way people would expect) and Luke as a character was explored more deeply and complexly than before. The film also features a new dynamic with Kylo Ren and Rey\\, one that I won't delve into much detail about. Adam Driver once again does a great job portraying the young apprentice of the Dark Side\\, perhaps even better than he did in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThere are a couple more important story arcs in the film. First is Poe Dameron's\\, one that allows us to see the more hot-headed and fiery side of his personality. I thought they took his character in great directions and gave him some really great moments in the film. The second one is the last character arc I'll mention\\, and that is Finn's. In The Force Awakens\\, this character was an integral part of the film's central plot\\, proving himself to be both a compelling and likeable new character. In The Last Jedi\\, he is given a subplot that\\, when removed from the film\\, detracts NOTHING\\, yes nothing\\, from the film\\, aside from an action sequence featuring Captain Phasma\\, who proves herself to be just as useless of a character as she was in the film's predecessor. I won't say much about this subplot since the trailers did not give much information about it\\, but it revolves around a story that added little to the film and featured a character\\, Rose\\, who was not compelling and who was poorly acted. I feel that removing this arc from the film would have improved the pacing of the first act and shortened the film's runtime for the better.\\n\\nI have a few more small issues with the film that I'll mention briefly. To start\\, the writing uses a lot of humor that usually works. However\\, there are moments in which it feels forced or where it detracts from otherwise serious moments (an issue I recently noticed in Thor: Ragnarok). It also sometimes relies on some strange CGI characters\\, which brings up another thing that bothered me. There were moments in the film that reminded me of A Phantom Menace because of its heavily inclusion of CGI animals and creatures in certain scenes. These play off as cheap appeal to younger audiences and nothing else. Finally\\, there are more than a few instances of \\\"cheese\\\" in both the dialogue and in the story elements\\, which are largely unnoticeable but sometimes caused me to raise an eyebrow.\\n\\nSo\\, the film does have more noticeable problems than The Force Awakens. And while these are noticeable\\, they also did not detract from the film much. By the time the second half of the film kicks in to gear and The Last Jedi showers the audience with emotional moments and incredible action scenes\\, I was more than ready to fasten my seatbelt and forget about the nitpicks I had with the film's first half. Obviously\\, talking about these would mean talking about the film's major spoilers\\, so I won't do that. But rest assured that these moments are as satisfying as any Star Wars fan would expect. They boast some incredible visuals\\, beautiful direction\\, excellent fight choreography\\, and all of the things associated with a well-handled blockbuster film. In short: don't worry\\, you'll get plenty of satisfaction from The Last Jedi. And you'll probably want to watch it many times again.\\n\\nStar Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is far from the best Star Wars film to date. However\\, this doesn't mean it did not meet my expectations and blow me away. It is not without its flaws\\, which are abundant in the film's first half\\, but these are easy to forgive by the time it finally sorts out its pacing and delivers what its fans want. The Last Jedi is another solid entry in the Star Wars saga\\, and it gets 4 out of 5 stars.","true":true}
