Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Least fun star wars movie. This is strike three\\, Disney\/Lucasfilm can't make a decent one. They can dress it up like star wars better than the prequels but that's it. Nothing has a reason for being or happening. You still don't care about the new characters\\, yet they kill the old characters in the dummest way possible. Pointless deaths for character you are using to bring in audiences isn't good. I laughed almost all the way through this film at how bad it was. I had more fun laughing at the prequels than this.","true":true}
