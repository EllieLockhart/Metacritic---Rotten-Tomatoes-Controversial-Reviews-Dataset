Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the most disappointing Star Wars movie to date.\\nHow could you have such awesome build up to this movie and blow it so bad. So many plot holes and pointless characters\\, some of the weakest deaths for some of the strongest characters in the Saga. It was so bad I cant stop complaining. I love Star Wars and this director just ruined it for me and so many real fans. Save your money!!!!!!","true":true}
