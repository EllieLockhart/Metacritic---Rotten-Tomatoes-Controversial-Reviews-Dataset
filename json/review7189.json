Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Enough has been said. The people behind this movie has no respect for the franchise. Even Mark Hamill hates it. They should apologize and declare it non-canon then do it again\\, with Leia dying in that attack to the bridge\\, because that is the only way to pay due homage to Carrie Fisher. With this\\, Disney has shown that it only cares about money. Walt must revolving in his tomb.","true":true}
