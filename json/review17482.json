Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I see a lot of people accusing the negative critiques of being bots\\, but they seriously underestimate how many people disliked this movie. Nonetheless\\, here's a general spoiler-free review. For those demanding specifics\\, there are plenty of youtube videos highlighting points here.\\nThe story is painfully slow. The logic is appalling even compared to the absurdity of the (Expanded universe\\, Original Trilogy\\, Prequels) and I think the humour was worse than the new Ghostbusters movie. Wasteful story arcs that would have been useful elsewhere. The main character's build up\\, while interesting\\, was rushed\\, making her seem overpowered\\, over-accomplishing and overbearing. \\n\\n Don't get me started about the bombers or the military strategy. Or Admiral Ackbar's heavily underplayed death. \\n It's not a terrible movie to watch if you're not a devoted Star Wars fan\\, comic reader etc. It is just\\, as everyone will tell you\\, a bad Star Wars movie\\, especially for Star Wars fans.","true":true}
