Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tratando de apartarse de los reciclajes\\, esta cinta va por su propio camino en especial en la \u00f9ltima hora con la direcci\u00f2n impecable de Johnson\\, los puntos en su contra su duraci\u00f2n de m\u00e0s de 2 horas y algunos gui\u00f1os de humor innecesarios.","true":false}
