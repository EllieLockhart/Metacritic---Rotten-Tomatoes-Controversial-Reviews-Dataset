Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst character assassination I've ever seen. We get it\\, Rian has a hard on for Kylo. Every character suffers to make him look good. Dunno who that Luke Skywalker was but he wasn't the gentle\\, good hearted man who only saw the good in others in the OT. We should have been more afraid when Mark said he hated the script and the choices for Luke.","true":true}
