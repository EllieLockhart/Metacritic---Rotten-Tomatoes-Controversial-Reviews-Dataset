Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were several fun aspects of the movie (spoilers)  including Luke's personality\\, Lea using the force\\, the connection between Rey and Kylo\\, and the scenes with Snoke. Beyond that\\, this simply wasn't a well crafted movie. \\n\\nThe first 20-30 minutes didn't really contribute to the story and basically centers around a parlor trick where 20th century telephone humor allows an X-Wing to disable a Dreadnaught. A lot of the battle made no sense include the X-Wing's super speed advantage then 180 turn around on a dime. All to establish a sister's character who dies after her own pointless journey. The side mission with Fin also contributed little to nothing to the overall story. The final climax does finally include Luke but only a vision. It was a fun little predictable twist although it ends with the movie killing off Luke. I think it's really unfortunate to have Luke go in a movie this poorly written.\\n\\nForce Awakens opened a lot of questions. The Last Jedi made the answer mostly irrelevant.","true":true}
