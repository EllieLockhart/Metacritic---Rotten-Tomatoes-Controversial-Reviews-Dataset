Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved it! It was fresh\\, emotional\\, surprising\\, exciting and still so very clearly Star Wars. I was positively surprised by some of the new characters in the episode but Adam Driver as Kylo Ren\/Ben Solo definitely stole the whole show. He was amazing! Special mention to Daisy Ridley as well! The movie might require some people to see it a few times to process everything..and be open minded! I think there are now many interesting directions where they can take the saga in the next movie.","true":true}
