Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie. Completely broke with previous movie. Terrible writing. Terrible direction. Terrible character stories and arcs. Didn't follow how the SW universe worked. Tries to be funny but comes off as awkward. The movie is a joke and there is no passion in the storytelling\\, and you can tell the creators of this mess didn't care about the film with the Terrible attention to detail and huge plot holes that couldn't be ignored because the overall story just sucked. On a positive note it was a movie that had a remnant of the stuff the audience could enjoy\\, space conflict with some force powers and space ships.","true":true}
