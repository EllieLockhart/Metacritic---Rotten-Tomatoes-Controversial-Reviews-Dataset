Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never before has so much money and time wasted on making a movie which fails to connect with the previous three decades of works. I submit only the following evidence as proof of the intent of the producers\\, Kathy Kennedy said This Star Wars is not the same Universe\\, it is an Alternate Universe of Star Wars story.\\n\\nThis alone proves that this story as well as Force Awakens\\, is an attempt to leave behind the original story so that personal vendettas could be resolved through the big screen.\\n\\nIf this movie was a different name\\, with out Star Wars in the title\\, then it could stand alone as a story.","true":true}
