Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did I miss something?  Am I losing the joy out of life?  Did I just watch a Star Wars film that was like\\, yeah I could take it or leave it?  First let's talk about what Star Wars 8 isn't.  It isn't a rehash of the #5 like #7 was to #4.  I thought director and writer Rian Johnson did a good job and making this a movie that stands on it's own merits.  I mean you can nitpick it and say there are a bunch of similarities\\, but when you have made eight of these things\\, there is bound to be that.  This movie also isn't one that gives interesting answers to many questions raised in #7.  I don't want to spoil things\\, but when it comes to Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, Luke Skywalker\\, it is if after criticism about #7\\, they did a rewrite to #8.  Let's talk about what this movie is.  It is about 30 minutes too long\\, with total side stories that could be completely cut out\\, and you wouldn't notice any difference.  I don't think this movie is as dark as many were saying it would be\\, as there were many differences in this one compared to the other seven\\, especially in regards to The Force.  The first half of the film is tedious\\, while it finally gets going in the second half.  It's more of a four act movie to me then a three act\\, and one could've been cut.  Visually\\, this thing is excellent\\, but I thought the makers were way too safe in the direction they went with this thing.  I mean is it worth seeing?  Sure\\, because it is Star Wars.  If you don't see it\\, are you missing anything?  Well\\, not really.","true":true}
