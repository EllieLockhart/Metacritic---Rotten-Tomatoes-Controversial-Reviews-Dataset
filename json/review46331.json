Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was insanely good. Emotionally beautiful\\, action wise perfect and cinematography unbeatable. Characters were written and developed well\\, constant moments of questioning and leaving you on the edge of your seat\\, it was almost perfect.\\n\\nOnly criticism I can give is the lack of a strong melody in the movie and the lack of information about Snoke before his death. Otherwise\\, it was almost perfect. Best Star Wars movie for sure\\, and if not\\, definitely top 3 easily.","true":true}
