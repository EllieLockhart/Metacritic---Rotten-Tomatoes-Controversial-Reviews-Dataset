Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Una historia llena de giros inesperados\\, bien llevada. Las escenas de batallas espaciales y luchas con lightsabers son dignas de otras de la saga. Finalmente\\, TLJ abre el universo de Star Wars a nuevas historias con nuevos protagonistas\\, sin repetir los cl\u00e1sicos esquemas de las trilog\u00edas anteriores.","true":false}
