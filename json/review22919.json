Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Looks great and sounds great\\, but that is where it stops being great for me.  \\n  What happened to Luke???  Did anyone one involved with this movie see the OT???  They took existing character arcs and thrown them in the sewer.  He deserved better than this.\\n  Why is Rey able to do the things she does with little or no training???\\nWhy didn't the First Order just jump a couple Star Destroyers ahead of the rebel fleet???  Was there fuel supply low also???  \\n  I can suspend a certain amount of belief when I go to a fantasy movie\\, but when it has such large plot\/story problems I cant help but feel pulled out of the world.\\n  Really lost all excitement for the upcoming films.","true":true}
