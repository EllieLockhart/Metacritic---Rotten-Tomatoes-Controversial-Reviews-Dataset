Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As good as advertised... Fully entertaining- action scenes were great\\, drama\/story scenes nicely advanced the story and had the right intensity\\, and characters developed nicely.  The pacing was quite good and didn't make the 2h40 seem too long.  Only stumble in my mind was the campy buddy type moments that seemed to be cuing up a Disney adventure ride.","true":true}
