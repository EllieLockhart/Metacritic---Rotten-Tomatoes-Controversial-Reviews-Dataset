Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not enough energy after wasting 3 hours of my life to offer any studied critique.  But it only needs two words.  Just terrible. Two redeeming features. The music score is still wonderful...and Skellig Michael looks wonderful! A total money making venture which has killed the' brand'.","true":true}
