Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best SW movies are A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. And now The Last Jedi. \\n\\nSince Empire ended\\, it was a downhill ride (RoJ was bad\\, the prequels were bad.) The new movies are better than anything that came out after Empire ended.  While The Force Awakens was ok it was derivative\\, and aimed at a new generation of viewers rather than people who saw the first SW in theaters. Rogue One was ok\\, well acted\\, but had some glaring flaws. \\n\\nNow this one - The Last Jedi is the first worthy successor to Episode IV and V. It is familiar yet new. The characters are well constructed and the story is well written. It has charm. The silliness is there\\, but it was always there in each and every SW movie ever.\\n\\nLoved it.","true":true}
