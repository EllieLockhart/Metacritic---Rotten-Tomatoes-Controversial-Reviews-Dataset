Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything JJ Abrams set up this director disregarded and literally threw away. He knew what the audience wanted but didn't want them telling him what kind of movie to make. Then he tried to tell the audience how we should feel and think. The force awakens brought everything great about star wars back\\, then this d-bag shit on it. BTW  leia flying in space was shit\\, finn was pointless and I will not be going to see the Han Solo movie.","true":true}
