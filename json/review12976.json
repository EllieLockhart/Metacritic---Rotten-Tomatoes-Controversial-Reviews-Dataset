Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t believe Luke\\, who wouldn\u2019t kill his father- the worst sith in the lore\\, would even attempt to kill his nephew; using hyperspace as a weapon creates conflict with past episodes (why not all ships use droids to hyperspace into the enemy?); comedy not on par with previous installments- this was borderline slapstick; Fin\u2019s side plot was a waste of time\\, boring and literally makes him a cancer to the rebels- his negligence gets hundreds killed; Fin\u2019s entire motivation in both films was Rey- then soon as he gets kissed by another girl\\, he\u2019s diverted? Is he a flake? ... Beautiful film. Good director. Great cinematography. Just felt Ryan Johnson trolled ALL the previous film\u2019s story arcs. ","true":true}
