Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did not like the movie.  Disney is destroying the star wars franchise.  There were so many great oppurtunities they could have went with like ray being lukes kid but now it looks like their going to make her hons kid and half sister to ren.  Oh wait a repeat again of the original.  Then they killed off the villan and put ren in as a brat who is now the leader.  Lets not forget the cowad and looser they turned luke into who is suppose to be the most powerful jedi of all time.  Yoda was a joke.  Its like they are trying to kill off star wars and push their agenda.  Loved lucas movies.  The spin off movies are the better then the main story line movies.  Oh and how did luke or anakin make peace for a 1000 years if they kill them off.  Cgi carry Fisher  in the next movie i guess.  Terrible movie.  Was not looking forward to this movie nor will i be looking forward to the next movie.  Did not watch hons in theatre and prob wont care to watch anymore disney starwars in theatre.  Cant remember since i was a kid when i didnt want to see star wars in theatre or was disinterested in it.  Star wars has now followed star trek in loosing a childhood life long fan. Thanks disney.","true":true}
