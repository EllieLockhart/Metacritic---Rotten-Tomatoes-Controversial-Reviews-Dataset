Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"saw\\, this film last night finally and i really enjoyed the last Jedi little bit more then force awaken and better then Rise of skywalker. . need to catch up on the other films from the beginning but the Disney trilogy was pretty great loved it so exciting to watch. and ready to see the other films.","true":true}
