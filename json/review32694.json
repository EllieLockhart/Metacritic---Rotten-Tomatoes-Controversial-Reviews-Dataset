Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi takes every previous film in the series\\, going back to the beloved original trilogy and flushes them right down the toilet.\\n\\nThe entire film\\, to borrow another's analogy\\, was like \\\"watching two turtles chase each other.\\\" Has the Empire ever heard of a TIE Fighter? Has Rian Johnson ever heard of gravity (or the lack thereof in outerspace)? From the opening crawl to the absurd end\\, this film was an utter waste\\, save for the two-minute interaction between Luke and R2-D2.\\n\\nYes it was visually stunning -- not including the Prequel-esque look of the gambling planet. But just because the throne room duel was fun to watch does not excuse the total lack of respect for everything Star Wars has meant for millons\\, if not billions of fans of the original trilogy.\\n\\nLeia was and still is a 'strong' female character. She was the leader of the rebellion as we understood it in both IV and V\\, until apparently replaced by -- you guessed it -- a woman in VI. So what's with all the political posturing about 'strong female leads' being absent from previous Star Wars? Poor writing in this film has absolutely doomed talented actors such as Laura Dern (Holdo) and Kelly Marie Tran (Rose) to most-hated character bin\\, right up there with Jar Jar and any non-animated version of Anakin Skywalker.\\n\\nNote to Kathleen Kennedy -- you don't have to portray men as idiots in order for women to appear smart. Clarice Starling is a great character because of matching wits with Hannibal Lecter -- she doesn't outsmart him but she manages to hold her own and save the day in the end. We don't need Mary Sues in Star Wars\\, we want living\\, breathing\\, emotional characters who aren't always going to be right and aren't always going to win -- they need to suffer in order to grow as characters\\, and the movies always end up better for it. The best written characters are not godlike beings or smarter than computers. They make mistakes\\, but find a way to pick themselves up off the ground and battle back.\\n\\nTime to move on from Kennedy and reboot this before EP IX further destroys what was once the most respected brand in film.","true":true}
