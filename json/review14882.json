Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly think that \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is the BEST Star Wars film I've saw! The scenes I mostly enjoyed was Rey and Kylo Ren's Force Bond scene\\, and the time when they temporarily worked together\\, destroying all of the Elite Guards. And about Rose Tico? I don't mind about her at all. Rose and Finn's subplot was a bit confusing\\, but okay. I would recommend watching the movie\\, since it's SO emotional!\\n\\nAnd for those hater who dislike the \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"\\, SHAME ON YOU.\\n\\nOverall: 10\/10.","true":true}
