Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Supremely disappointing.  A few enjoyable high points were completely destroyed by the inappropriate slap stick comedy & completely confused & thin dead end plot.  The clear attempt by RJ & Lucasfilm to prostitute & ultimately sacrifice SW canon & lore for a meta-version that they could congratulate themselves & proclaim that they succeeded in killing SW to create a Newer-Age version more to their liking.  The joyful willingness in dragging Luke's legacy down to a paranoid coward attempting to kill his nephew in his sleep only to whimper away into the Force void is tantamount to a High Crime.  This is the fatal flaw w\/ Kathy Kennedy\/Lucasfilm's (et al) attempt to remake SW in their own Leftist Regressive image that they have so many spinning plates advancing their agenda that they have completely lost sight of & destroyed the Myth & lore that made SW magical.","true":true}
