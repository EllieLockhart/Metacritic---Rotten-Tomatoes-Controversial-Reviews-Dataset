Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie does have its faults (unnecessary sub-plots\\, long runtime\\, cringeworthy jokes bordering on parody)\\, it expands the universe\\, has some really fantastic character interactions (specifically between Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke)\\, and raises interesting questions for long-time fans while doing justice to and developing returning characters\\, both from the new and original trilogies. I think it delivered on the hype in a way The Force Awakens never did. R\u00edan Johnson didn\u2019t play it safe and successfully took the Star Wars universe into uncharted territory. The Last Jedi will be a hard act to follow. ","true":true}
