This is a good techno-demo of PS4 and probably PS5 capabilities\\, but you can only call it a game when I'm drunk. \u201cThe Last of Us 2\u201d is a game as much as \u201cTommy Wiseau's Room\u201d is a film. The gameplay at the level of the first part\\, not some revelations or conceptually new ideas in it. The plot is not so simple. As it was written earlier\\, the plot of the first part is a mishmash of cliches\\, stamps and \u201cstolen\u201d ideas\\, and it would be better if the plot of the second part was the same. What the plot turned into is hard to say without the use of obscene curses. And we are not talking about those things on which the Internet raged for at least half a year. My entryway neighbor is a representative of the LGBT community\\, by the way I played the second part in her apartment\\, because I don\u2019t have a PS4\\, but she has one. And even she\\, watching my play\\, during the cut-scenes\\, sat with the expression of Jackie Chan from that meme. As a result\\, for me personally\\, the process of the game \u201cThe Last of Us part 2\u201d was similar to the process of eating a lean sandwich. Outwardly\\, it looks beautiful (graphics)\\, it tastes tasteless (gameplay) and at the same time\\, in between biting off another piece\\, they poke a sharp stick in your stomach (plot). You can eat\\, but diarrhea is guaranteed in 75% of cases. 3\/10!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
