Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't understand the hatred for this movie.  Mark Hamil gives the performance of a lifetime and has probably the best performance in the saga. This and Carrie Fisher caused me to grow close to tears on three sepreate occasions in the movie.  Poe and Rey also both grew on me this movie after leaving 7 being bored with both. Kylo Ren I was intrested in 7\\, but with 8 I definetly like him a lot more. That being said\\, there is certinaly some deus ex machina at some parts that I will not go into.  But they did a couple of things I wanted them to do after 7 that I did not think they had the guts to do and ended up doing them anyway.","true":true}
