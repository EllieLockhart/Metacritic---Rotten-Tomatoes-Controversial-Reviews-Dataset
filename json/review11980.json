Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely am going to see this and have my tickets!  I just don?t want them to take Luke and make him a scared old man!  He deserves more than that!   Ok just saw it had to lower my score 3 stars.  Liked the movie but disappointed in how characters were portrayed and other story plots that left gaping holes.   Had fun with 75 percent of the movie but I can't say it enough GAPING holes in story!","true":true}
