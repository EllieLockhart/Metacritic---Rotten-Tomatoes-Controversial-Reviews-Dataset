Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At this point every Stsr Wars director is damned if they do and damned if they don't.  Make it original\\, add some humor from unexpected people and fanboys rate it low. Give fanboys what they want and critics rate it low. \\nAction was phenomenal\\, Hamill was brilliant\\, Driver was perfect and the story gave several good bump moments.","true":true}
