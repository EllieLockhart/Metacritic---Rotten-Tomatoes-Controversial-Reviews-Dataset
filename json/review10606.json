Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Grew up with Star Wars and always loved the story\\, and i will for sure watch the 9th movie\\, but this one was the low point for me (yes\\, that even includes the prequels)","true":true}
