Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great addition to the ongoing Star Wars saga. While this movie leaves various questions unanswered\\, but I don't think this movie breaks the characters from both the original and new trilogies. The huge action set-pieces are so fun. A good and heartfelt Star Wars sequel.","true":true}
