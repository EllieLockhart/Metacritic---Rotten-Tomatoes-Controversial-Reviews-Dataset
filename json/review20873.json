Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was a die-hard Star Wars fan before watching this movie (prequels and all). Also\\, I loved all of the characters introduced in The Force Awakens. In my opinion\\, TFA was thrown out the window completely and the audience was left with this messy\\, childish\\, somewhat boring\\, and overhyped follow-up. It honestly felt like a slap in the face and I am now very critical of Star Wars. I still plan on watching future movies\\, but if the next few follow the same path as The Last Jedi\\, then I\u2019ll be very disappointed.","true":true}
