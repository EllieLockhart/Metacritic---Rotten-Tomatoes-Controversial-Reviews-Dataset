Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The more I think I about it the more I\u2019m disappointed in the lack of single story writer telling the trilogy. It\u2019s full of disappointments and odd decisions. Overall it some moments\\, but it\u2019s not like Force awakens and feels like to many poor decisions where made based on you needing to read other books and stuff to get the full story... (why wasn\u2019t it Akbar who did the suicide light speed thing? It would have been so much more impactful) Ryan just dumped so much JJ set up in 7... Hope JJ can redeem the story in 9. Force awakens and Rogue One are infinitely rewatchable\\, we will see about this one\\, once we can get it for home... \u2014- update Got the blu-ray Nope it gets worse. Hard to watch again...","true":true}
