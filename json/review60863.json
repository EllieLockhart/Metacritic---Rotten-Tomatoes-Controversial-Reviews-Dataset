The gameplay is beautiful\\, there's so much attention to the detail\\, the graphic (for PS4) is impressive\\, i can't even imagine on a version for PC. The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game is just a train wreck of a game. The story is terrible and poorly written. I was expecting much more because it was mainly coming from Naughty Dog\\, one of the best story tellers. But\\, i can clearly see i was wrong because of this game. I'm fine with playing as Abby\\, but they make her so bad. She kills Joel\\, one of the most beloved character in gaming history\\, and then they make you play as her. The thing that makes me so angry is because of the way Joel died and what he did before he died. He saves Abby and then acts dumb. In the first game\\, he was smarter than in this game. He tells them his name\\, which ends up getting him killed. And the way they killed him is terrible. He should have had a better death maybe like Arthur Morgan. The last thing that i will complain about this game is that the ending was horrible. Ellie killed all of Abby's friends and when she finally gets to Abby\\, she lets her go. All this hatred towards Abby and killing all of her friends to find out where she is\\, to end up not killing her. One of the most terrible endings to a highly anticipated game. I will say though\\, the game looks stunning and beautiful. The voice actors did a great job\\, but the game is mainly the same as the first one\\, but 3 buttons change. Its just the same game play. I will say\\, I love the flashbacks with Joel and Ellie. They were so much fun and I would just play those segments rather than the whole game. You can tell that the developers put much love into the game\\, but its ruined by the story. . I also like how there are options for people that have problems with hearing or seeing and such. That makes it so that the game is for everyone. I don't recommend this game to anyone and you could spend your 60 dollars on something that is worth your time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
