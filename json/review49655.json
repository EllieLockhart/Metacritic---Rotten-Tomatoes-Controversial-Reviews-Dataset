Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow unless the goal was to make the prequels seem better by comparison\\, this movie failed at all goals. It had pointless characters\\, silly storylines with no impact\\, wiped away old characters pointlessly after stripping them of any of their former glory\\, tried too many one-liners\\, and sought a laugh over any sort of attachment to any character. It's sad to see a franchise I loved fall so far. The writing for this atrocious and while Rogue One managed to find a good tone\\, this movie was completely tone deaf.","true":true}
