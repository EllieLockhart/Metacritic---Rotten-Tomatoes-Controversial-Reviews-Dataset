Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly just the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema. Highlights everything wrong with Disney's corporate takeover of the Star Wars Franchise. This movie doesn't exist to entertain; it exists to make money. Never watching this abysmal pile of dung again.","true":true}
