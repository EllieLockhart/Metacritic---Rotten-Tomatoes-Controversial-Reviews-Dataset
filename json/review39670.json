Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a breath of fresh air in the star wars franchise in the 21st century even though it can do without a certain storyline that wasn't completely necessary or as interesting as the main one.","true":true}
