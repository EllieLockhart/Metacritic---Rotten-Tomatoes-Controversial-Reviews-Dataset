Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"when i first came out of this movie\\, i was high on star wars hype thinking \\\"that wasn't so bad!\\\" but after some thought\\, i have come to the conclusion that the last jedi may well be the most useless star wars movie.\\nthere was ZERO tension. the plot was dull. all of the pre-established characters were either out of character or ignored\\, and the new ones (with the exception of rose who was the only tolerable new character) were complete wastes of time and writing. \\nthe tug of war between rey and kylo was useless. luke's 2 hour 32 minute long cymbalta commercial was an insult to the skywalker legacy and a waste of mark hammil's time. \\nand while the movie ends on an uplifting note with everyone's fave protagonist making it out alive\\, there is no set up for episode nine in way\\, shape\\, or form. the only lesson learned at the end of the last jedi is \\\"kylo is still bad\\\" and \\\"we have to make toys one way or another\\\" with those g-d forsaken porgs still aboard the millennium falcon.\\nthis movie wasn't worth the two years of anticipation\\, and it sure as hell wasn't worth the two and a half hour runtime. \\nsave your money and bootleg it (yes bootleg it. it's not even worth the price of blu-ray). i wish i had.","true":true}
