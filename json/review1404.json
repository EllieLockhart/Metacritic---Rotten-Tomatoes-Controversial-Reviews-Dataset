Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a die hard fan\\, I am extremely disappointed. Disney\\, you are ruining my life. I hate you. This is Star Wars not mickey mouse clubhouse. So quit it with the fart jokes and pointless dialogue and make a decent freaking star wars movie.","true":true}
