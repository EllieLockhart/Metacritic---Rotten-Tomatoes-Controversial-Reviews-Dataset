Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this is the worst star wars film in my opinion. Too many plot holes. Too many missed opportunities. And for all those people saying \\\"Oh man it was a good time\\, don't overthink it\\\" you can go and throw your mediocricy somewhere else. This franchise is being turned into a kid's franchise.","true":true}
