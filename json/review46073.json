Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually stunning\\, great action\\, wonderful surprises\\, and character development of Luke\\, Liah\\, Reye & Kylo that's amazing and makes them feel so human. I loved the risks they took and the future of this franchise. It's great and I recommend everyone see this movie to at least join in the debate.","true":true}
