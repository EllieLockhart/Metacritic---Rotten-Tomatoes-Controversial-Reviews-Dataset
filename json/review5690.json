Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Did the world need one more opinion on this movie ? Well\\, here it is:\\n\\nWe're not supposed to complain that Star Wars scenarists \\\"ruin our childhood\\\" because it's our problem\\, not theirs. Maybe\\, but on the other hand they capitalise on our childhood to make us dole out dozens of dollars to see their movie by selling it as a sequel.\\nSo - spoilers - to see Luke Skywalker as a bitter old looser\\, to watch Princess Leia send herself through space through fart propulsion\\, and have a sickeningly unconvincing love story between two ethnic-excuse characters shoved down our throat\\, is indeed tainted the memory of 1977's wonder a bit.","true":true}
