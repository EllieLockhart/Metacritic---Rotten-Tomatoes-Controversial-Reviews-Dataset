Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This will probably be the first and hopefully the last time I write something that disparages a Star Wars movie. I can not believe this movie was that bad. I feel like I was catfished... What I thought I was getting was not at all what I got. I want a refund of my time and money.","true":true}
