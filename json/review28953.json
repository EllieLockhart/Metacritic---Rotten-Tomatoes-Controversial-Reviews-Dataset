Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disliked the direction the movie was going to. Still dislike every character in the movie. I really have no Idea how you even feel one thing for Rey. Kylo is not even close to being a villain\\, he is just a big crybaby. I can't even take him anywhere close seriously.","true":true}
