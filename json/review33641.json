Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, just terrible. The pacing was bad\\, the movie didn't answer any of the questions set up in TFA like Snoke's identity. Rey's parents reveal was basically forgettable. The mission Finn went on was stupid and pointless. Their interpretation of Luke Skywalker was fucking weak. Even with out the Star Wars plot holes if you judge this movie as a stand alone movie\\, then there's only a few good scenes. The opening was good\\, some of the scenery is nice\\, but otherwise the story is a lameduck mess. The whole premise of them running from the first order the entire time while Rey is training harkens back to The Empire Strikes Back where Leia and Han spent most of the movie running from the Empire on the Falcon. Funny\\, people wanna praise this for being original or different but it's not even that\\, it's just terrible. You guys can say I'm hating all you want be it actually hurts me to do this. I love Star Wars\\, I've loved it since I was 5 years old so for them to do such a terrible job with this one hurts me cuz in my mind it tarnishes the legacy of the Saga. I don't like having to give this a bad review\\, but I can't bring myself to like this no matter how hard I try. The disappointment is just too real.","true":true}
