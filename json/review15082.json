Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left the theater thinking\\, but the longer I've thought about the movie\\, I've loved it more. It may be my favorite Star Wars movie of all time. It is strange\\, it feels weird\\, and it is not at all what you expect. But it has incredible\\, emotional moments and it feels as if this is the full potential of Star Wars. Unlike so many blockbusters this movie has a story\\, not just a plot. It has a message and it has depth. It's wonderful.","true":true}
