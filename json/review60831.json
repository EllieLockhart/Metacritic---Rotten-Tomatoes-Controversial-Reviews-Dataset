Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Looking at the many individual aspects\\, the game is great! But\\, over all (considering that the story is the most important thing)\\, is terrible !\r\rGetting us to play with Abby\\, after she killed Joel\\, is the biggest mistake. Obviously I didn't create any empathy. No matter the time spended with her\\, all I wanted was revenge !\rI understand that the whole construction of the story depends on demonstrating Ellie and Abby's revenge motivations and his affects\\, but play with Abby ? After she killed Joel !? Not for me.\rWe have a lot of life history with Joel and Ellie\\, a few hours playing with Abby will never hit the same felling. Considering too that Joel's choices have always been fair\\, makes Abby's revenge pointless and hard to deal.\r\rAnd this guides to the second big mistake: Joel's death. It would never happen from that way.\rTommy and Joel have been pass for a lot of problems\\, problems enough to comes to a point that they would never say their real names to strangers\\, especially in the circumstance that they said\\, surrounded only by strangers. I think Joel wouldn't say his name in that situation even if Abby had saved him instead of him saved her previously. I am okay if joel have died\\, but the way he died disregards who joel is.\r\rThe Last of Us didn't need a sequel and the second part was everything we didn't want. Doing what they did was disrespectful to the story itself and the fans.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
