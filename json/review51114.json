Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely good film. Complete story arcs and takes the story where it needs to grow. Most of the people that don't like it barely even remember what happens in it. They think Rey is is some sort of Mary Sue .  Luke and Anakin are more marysue than she is","true":true}
