Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was pure ideological propaganda that completely obliterated the Star Wars legacy like a wombrat in Beggar's Canyon.\\n\\nI've seen less feminist\/SJW propaganda in a Gender Studies class and that garbage is far more entertaining to watch than this nearly incoherent commercial for merchandise.\\n\\nIt looks like adding in more token characters did save this film in China as moviegoers there aren't buying the baizuo BS Disney is selling.\\n\\nDisney's Star Wars have successfully finished off a wounded franchise caused by those prequels. Star Wars is no more. It's Mass Effect: Andromeda in film form.\\n\\nSJWs poison everything. Enjoy your ideological conquest as you can\\, SJWs\\, because this franchise husk won't be a suitable host to you parasites for much longer - it's dead.","true":true}
