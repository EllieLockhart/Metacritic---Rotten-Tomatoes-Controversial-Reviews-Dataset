Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Abandons lots of build-up from Episode VII\\, contains innumerable inexcusable plot holes\\, and undermines audience interests\\, expectations\\, and desires so completely that it feels more like it is obnoxiously taunting the viewer than \\\"taking the franchise in a new direction.\\\" Entertaining as you watch it\\, but leaves you with an awful aftertaste.","true":true}
