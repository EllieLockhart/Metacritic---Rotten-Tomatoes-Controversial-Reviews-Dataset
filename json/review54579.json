Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm Not a star wars fan but i enjoy a good movie and story same as everyone else and for the amount of backing and budget this had it was one of the worst films i have ever seen. Besides the huge plot holes\\, bad directing and boring pointless parts\\, the whole message of \\\"let the past die\\\" is completely forgotten by end of the movie. The film states\\, that the stronger the dark then stronger the light\\, the universe will always balance itself out\\, the arms dealer selling to both sides\\, the jedi just being BS\\, the more you try to repress yourself the worse it is\\, the good and evil are just concepts then it completely throws that out of the window. Ren offers rey a way to change the universe a way to follow the film's earlier message to do away with light and dark and SHE REJECTS IT\\, the whole message of the film completely erased\\, he destroys his helmet to show he's following the message of the film THE HE REBUILDS IT AND PUT IT BACK ON\\, the only \\\"let the past die\\\" they really did was erase the old characters so they can sell and merchandise new ones\\, because its established that the universe WILL balance itself out once \\\"good\\\" wins with a powerful darkness and when offered another path film goes lololol nope. \\\"love will save us\\\" lol nope  the luke aka \\\"the past\\\" saved you. oh rey is super powerful now? guess what\\, so is ren then and when she able to win\\, guess what the dark side will rise and the only person who was like yeah we should just reject all that was rejected and just goes back to darth vader 2.0. Also suicide bomber light drive ships are now a thing and the most powerful weapon in the universe. This film is awful and for being such a huge powerhouse of a franchise it's really unforgivable to be this bad. \\\"let the past die\\\" nah\\, just put a new coat of paint on it and charge twice as much","true":true}
