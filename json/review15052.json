Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left my first viewing of TLJ feeling extremely conflicted. I let the film settle for a few days and was leaning more towards the negative side of the spectrum. But then I took my wife to see it the following Sunday and wow\\, I was blown away. The issues I had seen before melted away\\, I understood narrative decisions better\\, and I came to terms with some of the conclusions of the film. I even got teary at one point\\, and completely lost it at another point. Bravo\\, Rian. Thanks for taking Star Wars in a brave new direction.","true":true}
