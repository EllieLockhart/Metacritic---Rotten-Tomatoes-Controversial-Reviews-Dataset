Games like this once again show why some stories can only be effectively told through this medium. There are some pacing issues that drag down the story towards the second half\\, but after another hour or so it gets back on track and is incredibly engaging. I would say hard mode is the best way to play the game\\, survivor has the best enemy A.I. but requires a bit of trial and error\\, at least in my experience. It\u2019s very hard to talk about the story without getting into spoilers but most of the critiques levied against this game\u2019s story are easily explained\\, besides pacing issues which I previously mentioned. Don\u2019t let this game pass you by because of outrage culture and play it for yourself; it is a fantastic experience that I\u2019ve been thinking about and digesting nonstop since I reached the ending.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
