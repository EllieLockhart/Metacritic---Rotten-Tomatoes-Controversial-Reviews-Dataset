Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a family of Star Wars fans\\, I must say the movie stunk.! I realize they are shooting for a younger market and a female market. But they missed the mark. My 12 yr old fan girl left saying she will not go to the movies and watch another new Star Wars film. She said there was too many jokes. And not enough suspense to the plot line to keep you wondering what will happen next. I went because I wanted to see Luke. I wanted to find out who Rey was. And then just killed the whole movie. What a waste..","true":true}
