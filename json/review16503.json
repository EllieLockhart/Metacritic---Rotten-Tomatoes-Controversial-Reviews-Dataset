Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I must be getting old\\, I think Star Wars needs to retire\\, they way I experienced it. Tonight they did exactly that\\, with a transfer to the next generation. Several times during the film\\, it made fun of itself. The old fans understand that the whole concept was absurd\\, but we enjoyed it just the same. The new generation mocked it for the sake of it. The death of Luke was the death of people that understood that the film was an Opera in space. I was reminded of this when I heard the amazing score by John Williams. I was with my son and he was making fun of all the laser sounds\\, with his generation of 2 minute YouTube videos\\, it just was to much. He simply couldn't sit there through 2 1\/2 hours of Lazer fights and pandering to the base. With the real death of old characters and Kylo\u2019s request for Rey to go away from the old generation. I\u2019m definitely ready to join Luke and disappear into my Jedi robe. ","true":true}
