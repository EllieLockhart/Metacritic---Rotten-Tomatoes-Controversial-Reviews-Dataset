Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I just saw Star Wars The Last Jedi and Yeah Luke Skywalker was not kidding when he said this is not going to go the way you think\\, so many twists and turns I was on the edge of my seat during the entire movie\\, I love this movie I love it more than Force Awakens\\, definitely more than the Prequels *obviously* and I love it more than Rogue One and I have to see it again to know how it stands against the original trilogy but all in all Star Wars The Last Jedi is worth seeing more than once and you'll love it every time \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude0a \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ud83d\udc96 ","true":true}
