Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible. I can't believe critics gave this 8 out of 10. Who is paying them? This was a Michael Bay Transformers like jumble of garbage that abused the stories and childhood characters that we loved. It is not artistic\\, well thought out. There is no journey of the protagonist where she learns and grows\\, she is somehow just already perfect at everything. Meanwhile they destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker\\, making him a whiney\\, weak old man. This was far more interested in pushing social messages then telling a good story. Total garbage\\, extremely disappointed in the new management of the franchise.","true":true}
