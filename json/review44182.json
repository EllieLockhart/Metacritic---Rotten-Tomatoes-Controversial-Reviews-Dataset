Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To me Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi script it the best Star Wars script ever. I've probably seen the movie now 20+ times and it's not perfect\\, but for a Star Wars film is about as good as it gets. I do have issues with this trilogy\\, but most of those issues are primarily laid on whomever came up with the original concepts of the trilogy. The first film sets up Luke not helping his friends and becoming a hermit. People don't like RJ for going down that route\\, but that was the hand he was dealt. At the end of TFA we care about Luke\\, but it obviously Luke has quit caring about the rest of the galaxy. \\n\\nThe Luke question was always going to be divisive. Which is why JJ simply punts it to the middle film. There are so many little things in Rian Johnson's script that make the film worth watching over and over.","true":true}
