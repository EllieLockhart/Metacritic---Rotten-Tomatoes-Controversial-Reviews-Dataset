Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is by far the worst Star Wars film that has ever been made. Bad acting\\, poor sub plot. The jokes were forced\\, overused\\, and shouldnt have been in the serious parts of the movie. The only reason the Porgs were in the movie was for quick marketing money grab.The only good actors in the movie fell flat\\, and the only good characters that were in the movie were wasted completely. This film was a travesty. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of what he single-handedly did to ruin this franchise. If this is any indication of where this Star Wars franchise is heading\\, I for one will never watch another\\, and I have been a life long fan. Boo\\, Disney\\, boo.","true":true}
