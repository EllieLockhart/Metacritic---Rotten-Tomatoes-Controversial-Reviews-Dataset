Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force is just above average with this one! \\nSTAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI \\nMovies tend to become standardized under the same umbrella. That is why Disney buying out Fox scares me so\\, as many Fox properties may lose their distinctive voice in favour of the unity of content that Disney is driving towards. Before I had watched the film I was discussing that there was no way The Last Jedi was going to be awful\\, Disney wouldn't allow it. However\\, this standardization and control doesn't guarantee great films\\, it just guarantees above average ones. I\\, like pretty much 90% of the world\\, was anticipating The Last Jedi to a great length. However\\, disappointment sank in as I realized my greatest fear had materialized on screen: Rian Johnson does not have the chops to do a great direction. We've seen it Looper and in The Brothers Bloom. And we see it here when we desperatly want to ignore. What I loved about Rogue One is that\\, despite its flaws\\, it kept its sharp focus and clear storytelling\\, the same as in The Force Awakens. Here Rian involves himself on a double entendre of we as the audience come to expect vs what he wants to deliver and he gets muddy in his execution in the process. There are some great moments like the repetition of the reluctant hero this time in Luke and his last scene calling back to A New Hope; some stylistic references to Classic Hollywood which revealed a degree of untapped potential from Rian; and some references to the original trilogy. But I think the movie lacks scale\\, which is something that isn't easy to miss in space operas. The Force Awakens was such grand tour of a movie which was so well executed and well-handled in its scale but this one seems to be lost in a misshaped structure. Often the strength in intercutting between scenes comes from the power of a hard cut or a windows' movie maker transition and not a shot-reverse-shot of Kylo and Rey chatting\\, and not a fade in to highlight Leia and Kylo's bond. The strength in a lightsaber battle should be in sparse cuts and wide shots\\, not in overcutting (which overall plagues the movie). It's a very entertaining movie nonetheless with amazing visual effects and lovable characters. Also\\, Williams is again flawless with his musical callbacks to his early work. But there is an overall lack o sense of magnificence that came with a sturdy eye for camera that can't be ignored. And although I don't like to discuss plot\\, it does seem is insufficient to a grandiose hero's journey and it has subplots that annoyingly take away from the main thread. All in all\\, a movie that is amusing and good ride but it lacks any focus and that quietness of the original trilogy; it lacks the rhythmic saga of The Force Awakens or the twist on the genre of Rogue One It offers a lot to look at\\, but a lot to look away.","true":true}
