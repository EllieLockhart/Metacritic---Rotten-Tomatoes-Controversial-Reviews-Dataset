Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know why this turned out this way. Perhaps I had too high expectations? I thought The Force Awakens was solid\\, and carefully set up things to be answered in the next one. But this film totally negates those mysteries and overall craps on the franchise with a lot of its creative choices. Of all of them\\, three of them stand out the most: Leia flying in space like Superman then turned into a meme (thanks for making Carrie Fisher's last performance so laughably bad :( )\\, the bunny horses\\, and Kylo Ren tellings Rey\\, \\\"You're parents were nobody \\, you're nothing\\\"\\, WTF?!\\, and Snoke being totally pointless. Oh\\, and also a lot of the jokes were bad. Maybe not as bad as the prequels\\, but I felt beyond bored in most parts. But that light speed crash and Praertorian guard fight were really cool\\, but does not make up for the whole movie. Also a waste of Mark Hamill's character and spirit. Not really looking foreward to Episode IX. WHAT  A LETDOWN","true":true}
