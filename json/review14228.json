Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it one and a half stars for the cinematography which was great. However\\, the story was really poorly done and inconsistent with both the force awakens and the original trilogy. Too many plot lines\\, drama and random stuff to be considered a good movie. It plays more like a parody than a movie that takes itself seriously. I feel bad that so many people claim to like the movie as we will continue to get garbage like this from Disney due to fanboys loving anything with Star Wars in it... even if it\u2019s trash like this one. Lastly\\, what they did with Luke\u2019s character is just irresponsible. ","true":true}
