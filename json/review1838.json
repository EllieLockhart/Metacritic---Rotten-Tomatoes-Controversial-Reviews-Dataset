Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A series of pretty pictures with no substance behind. Less full of plot holes and more made of them. Characters were disposable\\, political views were laid on so overtly they take centre stage and the film actively works against internal consistency. What 'makes' heroes is established\\, then dismantled. This is a film written by committee to sell movie tickets and space-penguin toys.","true":true}
