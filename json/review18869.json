Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a poem\\, and it all worked for me very well. There were admittedly a couple of scenes that worked masterfully as artistic concepts but that did not play out well in execution\\, but the themes and morals and plot all coincide and support each other. The pacing is masterful.","true":true}
