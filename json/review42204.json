Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie should not have been released.  It lost all congruence with the prior film's plot lines and doesn't make sense.  Maybe it could have been saved in the edit room but I doubt it as the basic story was just so poorly written that it fails to be believable.  It's junk and it's the sole reason that SOLO failed at the box office.  That was fan backlash.  ","true":true}
