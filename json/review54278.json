Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ignore the Critic's score\\, their integrity has been compromised. Turns out\\, when the biggest entertainment corporation in the world invites you to events\\, screenings\\, and pays for ads in your publication\\, you'll do anything to not upset them. That's the only way I can see a professional movie critic giving this film a decent score.\\nIt's not lacking in budget\\, or badly shot\\, but the writing is pathetic. None of these characters are likeable or complex\\, every sentence is punctuated by SNL style one-liners that always fall flat\\, and none of the plot threads from the previous film are followed up on. The best chance JJ Abrams has of salvaging this trilogy is to excise this film from the Star Wars canon and make his own Episode VIII.","true":true}
