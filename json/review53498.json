Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Dreadful\\, I'm a huge fan of star wars and couldn't wait to see this film. It was set up to be so much more but this was simply awful. It was unbelievably childish\\, the writing was dreadful\\, the jokes were far too many and just didn't work. The characters weren't developed at all. I am a fan but not what you would call a fan boy. I lover the idea of star wars going in a different direction\\, doing something new but not this.. I will see the next episode\\, its star wars and JJ Abrams is back but I'm not confident after this mess.","true":true}
