Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's 3 hours of an elite battleship armada struggling to shoot down a rebel ship that just sort of ran out of gas. A bunch of other boring and forgettable things happen that just tear open plot holes and make the 3 hour grind even more tortuously bad.\\n\\nIf you don't care about literally anything else that has ever happened in the Star Wars universe\\, the movie might be kind of ok. Otherwise\\, this just serves to kill the franchise in the biggest whimper ever.","true":true}
