Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Another awesome story set in a galaxy far far away! This was a fun meaningful continuation of the saga. The film all together kept me engaged\\, but a lack of wonder was missing. Unanswered fan questions without anything to hope for in the next one. Would have gave 5 stars. Let the past die people\\, and enjoy the movies.","true":true}
