Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie by far. Ruined decades of character building for a mess of a movie. If you're a Star Wars fan i don't recommend seeing this. Read some of the EU and pretend this movie never happened.","true":true}
