Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t want to dislike this movie. There were moments I loved. But\\, there are swathes of bad writing\\, the whole thing is poorly structured\\, I was not invested in multiple story lines\\, about half of the dramatic payoff moments felt very forced\\, and there were several times I felt more like I was watching Space Balls than Star Wars. I don\u2019t dislike it for any stupid fan boy loyalty to source material or what\u2019s come before\\, it\u2019s just that I n spite of its moments of brilliance\\, this is a poorly made film. Hopefully I like it more on repeat viewing\\, I\u2019d love to come back and give it an extra star.","true":true}
