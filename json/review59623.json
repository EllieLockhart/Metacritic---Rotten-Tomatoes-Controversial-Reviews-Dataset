Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I wanna start by saying that it's important to remember that the first game was a game with a very heavy emphasis on story\\, and therefore I think this sequal is more for the fans of the original game\\, rather than newcomers to the franchise (since it's a continuation of an already developed story). I avoided all spoilers to give this game a fair chance. Sadly\\, it was immensely disappointing\\, ruining both main characters of the original game. The pacing of the game\\, with the flashbacks within flashbacks and such was really weird and badly executed. All of this is such a shame\\, since the visuals\\, gameplay and atmosphere is definitely \\\"game of the year\\\" worthy\\, but the bad story\\, bad character development (of most of the characters)\\, and inclusion of a horribly dull and uninteresting main \\\"villain\\\" just made this game uninteresting and boring for more than half of my playtime\\, and why would I give a boring game a high rating? Either way\\, I had such high hopes for this game\\, and it's just really sad that naughty dog couldn't live up to their previous standards.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
