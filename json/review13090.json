Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't know what movie the people who wrote horrible reviews watched\\, but it wasn't this one. The best acting in any Star Wars movie\\, with the possible exception of Rogue One. Every scene was unpredictable\\,  well written and nearly perfect. Yes\\, there were corny  jokes... It's Star Wars! Yes\\, it took the series in new directions. I enjoyed them all! What is wrong with you people?","true":true}
