Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I keep seeing articles referring to a \\\"small\\, vocal group\\\" of fans who were displeased with The Last Jedi. As a non-vocal fan of both the original series\\, and many of the new films as well\\, I feel compelled to have my voice heard as well. \\n\\nUnlike\\, many older fans\\, I enjoyed TFA. It was great to see my childhood heros again\\, and I was very happy with the new cast. J.J.'s film left me wanting more\\, quite excited to see what adventures will follow in what SHOULD have been an amazing middle film. TLJ dropped the ball on that in every possible way. Ryan Johnson decided to make his own kind of movie\\, with meandering plot lines that were wholly unnecessary and made the movie drag\\, Hollywood cameos that took away time and storylines for already established characters that were already working well\\, sophomoric humor that was out of place and frankly eye-rolling\\, agendas that felt arrogant and pandering. He disregarded everything that had been established in the previous film\\, and for decades before him. The script did nothing to move the story forward\\, except to abruptly end the Skywalker saga with nowhere to go next and for no good reason.  \\n\\nI left the theater feeling dumbfounded. This was Carries last film and there was no goodbye. Both she and Mark (and Ackbar) deserved an amazing last film and were given the worst possible in the franchise. Everyone in my family (fans\\, and casual movie goers both) equally despised this film. It is not a small minority. Most intelligent humans who witnessed this 2 mile-an-hour space wreck will never love Star Wars the same way again. This one film managed to cheapen the entire franchise\\, and discourage future any SW viewings.","true":true}
