Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an absolute piece of trash. Horrible Star Wars movie\\, id much rather watch the mediocrity that is the prequels\\, at least they had world building\\, character development and pushed the plot forward with every movie. This garbage on the other hand seemingly abandons good story telling for shock value and twists. Congrats Rian Johnson on your writing\\, great plot twists too bad you had to make a terrible movie to get them on screen.","true":true}
