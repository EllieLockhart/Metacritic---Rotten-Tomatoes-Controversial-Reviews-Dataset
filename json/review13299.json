Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't write reviews for movies however since it seems all the paid critics are drinking the same cool aid\\, I feel that I should write something.\\n  (Some Spoilers)\\nThe Last Jedi is bad\\, plain and simple.  The story is based on a super slow-motion car chase\\, \\nwhere no one can escape the clutches of the evil empire. \\nExcept for a couple of kids who seem to have snorted one too many lines of coke.  \\nI mean really\\, they all talk super-fast\\, and there is little to no critical thinking when coming up with a plan.  \\n\\nExample: (read the following at a X2 speed)\\n\\nFin: We can't escape because we are being tracked.\\\" \\nPoe: \\\"We should disable the New Order's ability to track us.\\\" \\nFin: \\\"Yeah we need to get on their ship and stop it.\\\" \\nPoe: \\\"Let's do it\\\" \\nRose: \\\"Let's go to the Casino\\, for the Code Break\\\"\\nPoe\\, Rose\\, and Fin: \\\"Go Team!\\\".\\n\\nCut to the Casino\\, how exactly did they get past the Massive New Order Fleet with no issues?  \\nNo time to worry about that because Rose and Fin are running from Aliens (who talk with a Texas Accent)\\, for parking their ship on the beach. \\nWhich gets them thrown in jail\\, without being processed or turning over their possessions.  \\nNot to mention they were thrown in the very same Jail Cell as the \\\"Code Break\\\" who also wasn't processed and decided to use his thieving tools to break out right at that time.  \\nWhy does he have tools to break out of jail with him? No time to worry about\\, because BB-8 just killed all of the guards with some coins.\\n\\nWhich brings me to another point\\, the Rebel Fleet has been battling the New Republic with ships that are a fraction of the size of the New Order's Fleet.\\nHow are all of their ships out of fuel\\, and the New Order's ships flying with no issues?  Also how are they burning so much fuel fly in the vacuum of space?   \\n\\nNow this!\\nLuke - After learning all about the power of the light and dark side which he used to save the galaxy\\, about 25 years ago. \\nHe forgot about all of that while teaching a handful of kids\\, and almost killed his nephew after \\\"feeling\\\" a bit of the dark side in the teenage boy.  \\nDid no one tell him teenagers may be a little moody?  Anyways being the righteous person that he is\\, Luke decided to run and hide away from everyone.\\nBut don't worry he survives by spear fishing with a 60 foot pole\\, and milking some alien that looks like a cross between a hairless bear\/cow\/ant-eater.  \\n\\nSnoke - So powerful and evil that no one knew anything about him\\, that is until he influenced Ben Solo and then somehow became the supreme leader.\\nAgain\\, don't worry\\, he will be kill off before we have to develop his character.\\n\\nLeia - Controls the force but only in the vacuum of space.\\n\\nRey - After a great build up about her missing parents and being torn away from the hands of her mother.  \\nTurns out she was thrown away by a couple of drunks\\, and she isn't special. \\nExcept that she is the second strongest force wielder.  Or is she?\\n\\nI have more to say but I don't have the time.   \\n\\nOh\\, and now Jedi can Astor-project themselves\\, as well as objects.","true":true}
