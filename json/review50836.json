Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bloated mess that flirts with greatness repeatedly\\, but ever and always picks the path of convention or safety. It is clear that Rian didn't like much of what JJ did and actively worked against it - murdering Snoke\\, Rey's parents\\, and the defacing of Luke. It does continue the trend from TFA by narratively crapping on what came before.","true":true}
