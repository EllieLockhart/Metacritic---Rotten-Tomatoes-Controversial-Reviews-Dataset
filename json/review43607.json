Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not the star wars we should have gotten. I even went back to the theaters to watch episode 1-3 multiple times... I won't be going back for this one. Rian Johnson took a massive dump on all the characters we know and love. Moving on ia one thing\\, but TFA was a true star wars movie heading the saga into new and exciting characters with our classic favorites giving us that warm fuzzy feeling. The more I think about it the more mad I get.","true":true}
