Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I spent 3 minutes seeing if I could give this movie just a quarter star\\, to express my feelings about it. I love sci-fi \\, and find Star-Wars (to this point) entertaining\\, but I was never a super-fan of Star Wars\\, so I went into this film with no expectations\\, and I was still disappointed. I was literally checking my watch in the middle of this movie. There were so many stupid plot holes\\, and jokes that didn't land. \\nOne thing that I noticed\\, was that there is no dramatic irony at all in this movie (I challenge you to find one piece of info that the audience knew before the characters did).  There were too many cutscenes of the squadron of POC's. Why not make Del Toro the hacker they were supposed to be found. Why make Luke drink Walrus milk\\, Why make Rey a Mary Sue? \\nThis movie magically made the prequels better \\, something I thought imposible.","true":true}
