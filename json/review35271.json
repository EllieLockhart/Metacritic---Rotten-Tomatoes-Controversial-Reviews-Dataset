Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The greatest spit in the face to starwars fans to date. This film lacks emotion\\, the plot is paper thin\\, and gives no room for suspension of disbelief. If you are a fan of the series you will leave having cringed from the opening to the close.","true":true}
