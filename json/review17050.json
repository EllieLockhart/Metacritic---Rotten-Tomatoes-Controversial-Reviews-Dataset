Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed TFA it really made me believe SW was back!  I couldn't really understand why JJ was not back for this one but I saw Looper really enjoyed this film and thought TLJ was in good hands but little did I know that TLJ would wipe the fan boy jiz from my eyes and slap me in the face. This is the ultimate bastardisation of SW a troll of a film made by a Troll.","true":true}
