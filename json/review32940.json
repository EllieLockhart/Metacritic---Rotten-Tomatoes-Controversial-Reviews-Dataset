Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"STOP with the FAKE 5 star reviews!  Damn you RT for giving this steaming pile of crap a golden tomato award.\\nEasily the worst Star Wars movie ever.  If it wasn't Star Wars it would be OK.  But it intentionally crapped all over the canon.  They not only killed iconic heroes\\, they rewrote them as evil and gave them pointless deaths. \\n\\nPlease please kill Jar-Jar Boyega.  He's simply the worst actor ever.  It's already been admitted he was an affirmative action hire.  That's how he snuck through quality control.   I don't mind a black guy at all.  Forest Whitaker was amazing in Rogue One.  Please kill off Jar-Jar Boyega and replace him with 10 good black actors if you want.  God he's a nightmare.","true":true}
