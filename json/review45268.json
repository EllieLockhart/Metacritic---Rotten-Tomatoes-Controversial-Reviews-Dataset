Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Updating my review since my earlier 1\/2 star review apparantly doesn't factor into the rotten tomatoes percentage rank of this film.  \\nI want Disney and Lucasfilm to know just how bad this film has been received by fans.  Its important enough for me to take time out of my busy schedule to come back here and repost a negative review.  \\nRian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy will have their names forever associated with the destruction and betrayal of the Star Wars saga! I'm sure they will wear it like a badge of honor all their lives as was their intent.\\nIf you haven't seen this film\\, please read the many thoughtful and detailed reviews already posted on all that is just plain wrong with it\\, and save your money for a redbox release in a few months.\\nI truly wish I had not seen it.  I've never left a Star Wars movie with such a solemn\\, \\\"how did this happen?\\\"\\, feeling in my gut.  This 40 year fan\\, with two sons also raised to enjoy the saga\\, no longer has any interest in the Star Wars future.  I will cherish the originals\\, which will live forever in my mind\\, but the future\\, thanks to the awful Last Jedi\\, truly is dead.","true":true}
