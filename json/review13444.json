Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed this movie. The great moments are as good as any in the series. The bad ones are still better than anything in the prequels. My guess: Those that don't like it are ticked their own predictions weren't met or guesses didn't come true. Doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I am trying to see where cinematically they think it's bad. Maybe the Finn and Rose story line? Mad props for taking chances. Another guess: there is a lot of sest up for the last movie.","true":true}
