Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The character developments in the previous film were left by the wayside in this one. The \\\"cheese\\\" factor surpasses Phantom Menace at certain points. The movie is visually stunning\\, but in a sea of overproduced cgi flicks\\, it doesn't stand out. It lacks grit\\, soul\\, and emotion\\, a vacuous cash grab. It's truly the end of an era\\, the saga is officially dead\\, time for some new fresh original sci-fi from young up and coming directors.","true":true}
