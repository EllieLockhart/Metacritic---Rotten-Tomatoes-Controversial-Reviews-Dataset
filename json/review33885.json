Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible plot\\, unlikable characters\\, plenty of forced feminazi propaganda. Went to see it with my mother\\, after we left she asked me are all Star Wars movies so.... dumb. Visually perfect\\, but without any positive feelings left behind.","true":true}
