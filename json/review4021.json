Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Boring\\, with scenes that don't make any sense and having force jokes thrown in didn't make it any better. Common sense is non existent. characters personality complete change from the previous film\\, but at least there are cool scenes to look at.","true":true}
