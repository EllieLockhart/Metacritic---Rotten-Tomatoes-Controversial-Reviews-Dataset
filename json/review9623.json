Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie\\, but not amazing. The visuals\\, scenery\\, creatures\\, and character design were good\\, but nothing wowed. Kylo\/Ben\u2019s story was interesting. Luke was meh. The near defeat of the Rebellion did not feel as weighty as it should have. The hopeful ending was nice\\, but a hopeless one would have been much more powerful.","true":true}
