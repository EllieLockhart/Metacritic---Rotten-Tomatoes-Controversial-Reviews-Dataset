Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like it a lot. The 0.5 is lost from the not-so-quality humor and the unrealistic fight between Rey and Kylo vs Imperial Guards. If you remove there from the equation\\, an overall great SW movie! Fantastic character development on Kylo\\, enough flashbacks and \\\"fan-service\\\" and plot twists!","true":true}
