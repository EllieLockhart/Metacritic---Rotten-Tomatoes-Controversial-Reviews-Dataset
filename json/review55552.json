Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No respect for the characters\\, the story and the messages of the original saga. This is not a Sequel\\, it' is an abomination born from the degenerated desire to be \\\"innovative\\\"\\, \\\"progressive\\\" and \\\"subvert expectations\\\" at the expense of the story\\, the lore and logic. This isn't a movie\\, is an offense to the intelligence of the audience.\\nWhat a shame.\\nAnd it's not true that if you watch it multiple times you start to like it\\, I've watched it 3 times\\, at first with friends\\, than with my family and the third time alone\\, and every time I discovered more and more logical errors with the overall saga and the film itself!\\nP.s. I really didn't care for the \\\"pushing an agenda\\\" argument\\, until now. It's blatantly obvious\\, please stop \\, Star Wars wasn't (and shouldn't) be used to promote political ideas.\\nThis \\\"movie\\\" broke my heart and ruined Star Wars as a saga because now the previous film are completely meaningless and this is exactly what a Sequel shouldn't do.","true":true}
