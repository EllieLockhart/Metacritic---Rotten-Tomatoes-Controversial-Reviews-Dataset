Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I ca' figure out why people are loosing their minds over this. I grew up with the Star Wars universe housing most of my heroes\\, and this film does not falter from that. It's certainly better than the travesty that was episodes 1-3.  This movie is super enjoyable in every way\\, and I especially like the anti-war sentiment and the wisdom that is knowing that all things must rebirth themselves\\, even the Jedi order.","true":true}
