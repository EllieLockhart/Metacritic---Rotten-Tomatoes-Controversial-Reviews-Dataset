Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is guilty of forgetting two things: 1. That it is part of a multifilm saga\\, set in a multimedia universe and that it should at least respect what came before it. 2. That it should be a good movie on its own.  There are plenty of things I could nitpick\\, but it was all summed up in the unnecessary reshoot of the initial Rey\/Luke scene. He receives his father's lightsaber and just pitches it over his shoulder\\, and from that moment forward\\, this film continuouosly reiterated the notion that any investment you make in this lore will net you nothing in return. Johnson's treatment of the mysteries and questions we were left asking after Episode VII was a clear statement that he would not be bothered to give his predecessor's work the gravitas it deserved. He threw them away\\, providing non-answers and forced humor in their place.  This movie left me with zero desire to see it again\\, and especially zero desire to see the next movie or future games and books and TV shows set in the universe.  This movie has critically wounded the richness of the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
