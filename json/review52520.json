Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"a horrific mess that is extremely inconsistent with the Star Wars universe and mythos. It's like having a jigsaw puzzle that comes with a deformed piece that just doesn't fit. Granted\\, the movie is a very 'pretty' puzzle piece with all its special effects and colorful explosions. But no matter how you twist or rotate it\\, no matter how much you pound on it\\, it just doesn't fit into place with the other pieces\/movies. I'm perplexed by all the so-called expert critics the loved it because it was \\\"new and different\\\". Different doesn't automatically equal good.","true":true}
