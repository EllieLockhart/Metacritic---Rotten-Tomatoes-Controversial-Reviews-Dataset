Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a travesty because Rian Johnson was so tickled by his own perception of his self-perceived cleverness and drive to \\\"subvert expectations\\\" for no reason other than just to do it\\, that he forgot that he was creating the 8th movie in a 40 year old saga\\, rather than doing his own one-off movie.\\n\\nJohnson begins the movie by unnecessarily breaking a key component of the Star Wars universe (that unless there's a tracking beacon\\, jumping to lightspeed cannot be tracked) for no other reason than to drive a boring and stupid plot. His grand idea? Let's have a slow motion space chase that lasts for almost the entire movie... That will be fun for people to watch.\\n\\nThe way to turn off this new technology must be procured from a useless side quest with Rose and Finn which ultimately could and should be excised from the movie without impacting the rest of the story line.\\n\\nJohnson's introduced Rose Tico to give Finn some one to go on this side quest with. While I think Kelly Marie Tran does fine in terms of acting the material she was given - the material is the problem. There's no real reason to add this character.\\n\\nLikewise\\, and twice as egregious is Admiral Holdo. Playing a part that should have been carried out by Admiral Ackbar\\, but wasn't... For reasons?... Holdo's character refuses to share vital information the entire run of the movie just to serve plot points rather than for any discernable motivation for her character. Her final\\, again Star-Wars-world-breaking-for-no-purpose-other-than-a-\\\"cool\\\"-shot manuveur only serves as a capstone to Rian's laziness and lack of story-telling finesse.\\n\\nAs for Luke Skywalker... Rian Johnson's Luke Skywalker is not Luke Skywalker. When Mark Hamill says to you\\, \\\"I disagree with every decision you've made for this character\\,\\\" and you're too filled with hubris to take a step back and question whether you're on the right track\\, nothing good will follow. Without getting in to spoilers\\, on the outside chance anyone is reading this without having seen the movie\\, Johnson ignores the entire thread of character development in the original trilogy and disregards the core driving force of Luke's belief system - that ANYONE\\, even his world-killing\\, child-slaughtering\\, wife-murdering father can be brought back to the light - in service of his lame plot.\\n\\nSo\\, in summary\\, we have a world-breaking and simultaneously boring main plot\\, a new character who only exists to keep the plot on the nonsensical tracks Rian set out\\, a side plot that advances nothing for the story\\, and a total disregard for arguably the most beloved character in the franchise - all leading up to a lazy repeat of the Hoth battle that makes even less sense.\\n\\nI have never left a Star Wars movie so angry as I left this one\\, and rank it as worse than all others\\, prequels included. You're better off reading the synopsis and skipping over this one to go straight to the course correction that is The Rise of Skywalker.","true":true}
