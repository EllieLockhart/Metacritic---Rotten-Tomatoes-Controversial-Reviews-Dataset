Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie had many flaws. The one that stands out the most is its treatment of the character of Luke Skywalker. Its as if all the previous films were ignored and no continuum was taken into account when it came to presenting the most recent incarnation of Luke. Trying to imagine Luke as a hopeless jaded character seemed very out of place.  A wise old yoda like character would have made more sense.  Even Darth Vader had a moment of redemption in the original three.","true":true}
