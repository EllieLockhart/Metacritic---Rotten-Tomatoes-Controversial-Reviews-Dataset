Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"BIG time fan of the 'original' and magical trilogy of iv v and vi. I can see they have best intentions with the new trilogy they are setting out new characters and idea's -  but it's beginning to get repetitious and some things are becoming more nearer to the last trilogy attempt of i ii and ii.\\nEven my kids were not THAT impressed and spotted the Cliches that are to apparent. Losing faith in Disney's attempts :(","true":true}
