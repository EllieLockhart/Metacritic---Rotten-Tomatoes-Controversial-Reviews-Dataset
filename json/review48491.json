Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"With the weekend over\\, I'm assuming most of the Star Wars junkies have seen \\\"The Last Jedi.\\\"  Personally\\, I liked the latest installment as it took the plot in a direction I didn't expect\\, had some great acting and some mind blowing special effects. I've talked to a few folks that really disliked it\\, and those seem to be the most ardent fans that tend to bathe in all the online yore about the movie. It's hard to disagree with some of their sentiments\\, particularly that the film doesn't answer a lot of the key questions that fans have asked. I'll stick by the fact that this is a fun\\, exciting chapter in the saga\\, but do agree that there were 3-4 scenes that almost felt forced. Sort of like watching a \\\"Rogue One\\\" movie that suddenly erupts into a George Lucas style Star Wars movie. The segments of the film involving the casino\\, Leia in space and anything to do with Rose had some serious eye rollers. Still\\, overall I really enjoyed it. While we don't find out who Snoke was or who Rey's parents are\\, the storyline of how Kylo Ren\\, Rey and Luke Skywalker embrace their fates is pretty damn cool. Hopefully\\, JJ Abrams closes the trilogy answering a few more questions and avoid the \\\"Lucas\\\" style moments.","true":true}
