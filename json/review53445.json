Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney paid $4 billion to get the fan base that comes with Star Wars.  \\n\\nBut along with that existing fan base\\, you get obligations.  You get the universe those fans want to see.\\n\\nIf you wish to create your own universe\\, where the physics\\, combat\\, and magic\\, and characters are all different\\, go create your own.  \\n\\nDon't change major features of the existing universe that you expect fans to come and see and then dismiss fan complaints as \\\"not prepared for change.\\\"  This isn't change.  This is somebody taking advantage of the expectations (and money) of fans\\, and delivering their own\\, completely alternate universe.\\n\\nThis might have been a fine movie.  But that wasn't Luke;  that wasn't Leia;  the powers of the Force were not what there were supposed to be;  the rebels weren't the rebels; the New Order is I'm not sure what; where are the Sith; and what on earth happened to the Republic? And how on earth did Luke die?\\n\\nThis was a clumsy fan film done with the money to pay for top-tier special effects.\\n\\nGive it another name and it might have been a passable movie.\\n\\nBut it wasn't Star Wars.\\n\\nDisney?  Go get your own universe to muck up.  Stop giving ours to ignorant children.","true":true}
