Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like a good plot with acting to support but this movie had neither. The action was ok\\, some of the fight scenes just didn't work but the effects were great. The themes and messages woven into the movie arent meaningful or intelligent\\, more preachy and naive. They really wanted to change the whole star wars universe story and mix in their cultural lessons which they did. Problem is\\, what came out the other side of the Disney meat grinder is a mess that doesn't leave you in awe of their story.\\n\\nAlso the dialogue relied heavily on seemingly pointless exposition and constant phrases meant to inspire but just came across as odd or naively sappy. Found myself not caring if the rebels lived or died and how they have built these characters up\\, I just really am not vested in them.  Alot of little decisions caused this but one of the big is that Rey doesnt have a real hero's journey which is a shame. We didn't get a proper development of her character to like her like we did  Luke. Yoda cracked on Luke about his lack of training and focus then in this film after seemingly little training at all Yoda saying she knows everything in the Jedi training books. Just a real switch from how every other Jedi Padawan learned in the every other movie.","true":true}
