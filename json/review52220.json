Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After weeks of avoiding trailers\\, attending my local premier alone (no babysitter) at 9:30pm by 11:30 I was already researching reviews. It's like Disney took what everyone liked about TFA and stretched it out for 3.5 hours. The combat was weak\\, the plot thin\\, no questions were answered\\, awkward performances by Luke and Leia. This is truly a disappointment. Disney needs to get out of the dad jokes and focus more on the cannon. I'd recommend you wait for the redox.","true":true}
