Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After a somewhat disappointing Episode 7\\, I was hoping for a big improvement and original story. Only half of the latter came to pass.\\n\\nAlthough there were some pleasant surprises with The Last Jedi\\, there were far more moments that had me rolling my eyes.\\n\\nNothing more is explained of Rey's origin\\, Poe remains one one-dimensional\\, and some of the new characters suffer from the same trying-too-hard energy as the cast in The Force Awakens.\\n\\nThey play fast and loose with Force abilities\\, but that can be forgiven.\\n\\nOverall\\, I can't recommend this one for the theater.","true":true}
