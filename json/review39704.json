Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a franchise killer that seemingly goes out of its way to take a steaming dump on the legacy of the franchise\\, destroys the character of Luke Skywalker\\, and is\\, frankly\\, boring while doing it. The fact that according to this website the critics have given it a 93% rating calls into queation credibility. \\n\\nThe choices Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy made in this movie call intp queation the viability of this franchise and I for one am walking away from the franchise.\\n\\nCarrie Fisher is dead in real life. The Republic is destroyed. Han Solo was murdered. Luke Skywalker is gone. Hell\\, even Ackbar is killed off (offscreen). \\n\\nWhat a waste. What a dumpater fire of a movie.","true":true}
