Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the first Star Wars movie where the director appears to not understand Star Wars. I'm a huge Star Wars fan\\, and found plenty to like even coming out of the theatre seeing the much maligned prequels. Time and introspection has settled into my option that while I still enjoy the Phantom Menace or Revenge of the Sith\\, they aren't on par with the original trilogy of Star Wars films. This film however\\, I could never quite enjoy myself.  The special effects were as colorful and amazing as ever\\, but the plot development\\, and forced humor took me out of the movie every few minutes with something terribly out of place. I completely understand what Rian Johnson was going for here\\, however risks like these are better taken in a stand alone movie and not part of an established set of characters and storyline. Mark Hamill is a very talented actor\\, and it shows here\\, however nothing of the previous character is left. Even his call to action at the end of the movie\\, is poorly fleshed out\\, and executed. While I still very much like Poe Dameron's character\\, most of the movie was completely unnecessary. His plot-line was two well intentioned leaders not sharing information for absolutely no reason\\, and there was some faux drama and a superman sequence for a leading character (When you see it you'll know what I mean) and an entire subplot with Finn and Rose\\, and Benecio Del Toro with an odd speech impediment\\, was equally as throw away. Rey and Kylo Ren's story was interesting\\, but done at the expense of nearly every other character. \\nThis was definitely a film made for the critics\\, and not for the fans of the Star Wars franchise. I thought I was crazy with all the good reviews I've seen\\, until I came here and saw the disparaging numbers between critics and fans\\, which make me feel slightly less like the jaded fan boy.","true":true}
