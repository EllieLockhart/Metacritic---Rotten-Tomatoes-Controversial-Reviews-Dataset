Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film that I wanted to like so badly. A film where I waited patiently the whole time expecting it to get better. But it did not. Disney has taken its grasp on the series with unneccesary comedy\\, pointless characters\/scenes\\, cheesy dialogue\\, and a predictable plot. It seems exaggerated\\, but I feel cheated by paying money to see this film. Cheated to see a series that I adored turn into what it is. I appreciated the Force Awakens and even remotely enjoyed it. I appreciated this films willingness to add new material. But it doesn't make up for the fact that the movie is so poorly written and predictable.","true":true}
