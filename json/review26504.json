Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Of all the questions we were left with at the end of Force Awakens\\, all were either forgotten (who is Snoke\\, how did the First Order come to be\\, what is the political state of the galaxy\\, what was \\\"the awakening\\,\\\" what is it that Darth Vader started that Kylo wanted to finish)\\, or worse\\, answered in the least satisfying way possible (who are Rey's parents\\, why is Luke hanging out on Porgland while the galaxy goes to hell).  Utterly disappointing\\, and with nothing to redeem it on its own merits except for the fact that it looked pretty.  Boring story with boring characters and boring (and unnecessary) plotlines\\, while all the things that we actually care about are ignored or literally stabbed through the gut.  Worst Star Wars movie by far.","true":true}
