Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's as bad as the real critics (not those bought off by Disney) say it is.  I sat through 2.5 hours of total crap with only about 20 minutes of scenes that had the right to call themselves Star Wars.\\n\\nI couldn't get into most of the scenes and really didn't like any of the new people introduced in this episode.  I felt like this was a Marvel movie with bad acting and unfunny humor that just would have elements of Star Wars sprinkled in.\\n\\nIt was really\\, REALLY bad.","true":true}
