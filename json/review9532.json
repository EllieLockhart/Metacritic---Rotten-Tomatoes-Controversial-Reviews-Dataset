Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good drama\\, new features added to the mysterious force\\, very good acting of Mark Hamill\\, the redemption of Luke after failing his family\\, still better than seen Ewoks defeating the empire or the prequels\\, remembered me when I first saw Empire Strikes Back\\, nostalgia and drama in key moments of the movie.","true":true}
