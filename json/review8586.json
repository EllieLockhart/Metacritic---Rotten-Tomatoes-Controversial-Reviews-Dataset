Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First off\\, I am not a robot. Nice try Disney but you can't blame your lack of good ratings from actual fans on robots. This movie could have turned the sequel franchise around\\, instead it just shoved it deeper into a hole of crap. Disney when are you going to get that nobody wants political and cultural agendas shoved down their throats?? The propaganda alone is enough to give this movie a bad rating. But\\, on top of that\\, the plot sucks! So many holes and pointless characters and stories. Whoever wrote it should be fired. They basically took Empire Strikes Back's plot\\, copy and pasted\\, and then poked at it with a stick and called it a movie. I'm ashamed for the Star Wars enterprise and Lucasarts. You are better than this. JJ Abrams\\, good luck. You're gonna have a hell of a time trying to redeem this trilogy.","true":true}
