Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very surprising! Do NOT listen to critics! ESPECIALLY CNN! And don't let your expectations get too high! They are high enough! I was blown away! Also... Find a good crowd of Star Wars geeks... Preferably costumed. Enhancement! Worth multiple viewings!","true":true}
