Everyone seemed unlikable and everything so predictable. After finishing\\, though\\, I have to give some credit to the writing - though the plot was still far from the most inventive\\, I enjoyed it\\, mostly because of one of my favorite legendary monsters.\r\rIt does not come as a surprise that the butterfly effect mechanic is hugely overrated - once again\\, you do not get actual significantly different content in the game\\, you do not influence the overall story\\, you just choose who makes it through and who doesn't. One playthrough of the game is enough\\, is what I want to say\\, and you can quite fully understand the story even if you don't find all the clues. You can go back to the episodes and try to get your favorite character (not that there were many for me) to make it\\, but that's about it. You're not making very many moral choices (maybe one or two)\\, most of them are just random and their consequences completely unforeseeable. I'm fine with that\\, but the opening sequence made me think the game posed as being more than that.\r\rWhat it comes down to is that you don't do much here as a player\\, almost half of the action seems to take place in cut scenes\\, except for the times you do some quick QTE button pushing or you're asked to make a choice or quite boringly wander around under cinematographic camera angles. So if you're feeling like a eight-hour long horror movie\\, which is sometimes my case\\, go for it. The plus side is that you can get rid off all the annoying characters who seem to swarm this is sort of genre and I did rise up to the opportunity.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
