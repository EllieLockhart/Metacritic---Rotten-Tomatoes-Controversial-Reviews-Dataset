Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason I think this is a Star Wars movie is because of its name. Other than that\\, it should be put in its own separate universe\\, it's just that bad. What can you find inside The Last Jedi? Horrendous melee brawls (lightsabers and other weapons)\\, ridiculous ship-to-ship battles\\, flawed character arcs (mainly Finn and Phasma's) as well as just bad characters in general\\, massive plot holes\\, a frustrating storyline\\, and the destruction of the character known as Luke Skywalker. It's no surprise that this isn't even getting one star from me.","true":true}
