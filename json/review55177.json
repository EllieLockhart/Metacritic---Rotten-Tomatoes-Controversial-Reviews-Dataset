Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I will NOT be going to theaters to watch Episode 9!\\n\\nThey have officially divided the Star Wars fanbase down the middle and have completely and utterly alienated all the older die hard Star Wars fans. It's split literally down the middle!\\n\\nRian Johnson and Disney's decision to ignore nostalgia is going to come back and bite them in the ass in 2 years when it comes time for Episode 9 to be released.\\n\\nI won't buy a ticket. I won't go see it in theaters and I won't because Disney not only disrespected me as a Star Wars fan...they committed the worst unforgivable sin you can do to a Star Wars fan... They ignored what 50% of fans wanted.\\n\\nNostalgia.\\n\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi did not FEEL like a Star Wars movie.\\n\\nIt's not my Star Wars.\\n\\nIt's not the Star Wars I know and love anymore.\\n\\nDisney ignored me as a Star Wars fan and the deeply emotional feelings I have for Star Wars. People will laugh and joke and say I'm too emotional. But I watch Star Wars for that very reason. The emotions it impart. The feeling is gives me watching my favorite sci-fi films ever. That feeling it what made Star Wars great and Disney completely and utterly ignored 50% of the Star Wars fans and how they feel.\\n\\nA movie is about the FEELING it gives you when you watch it. Disney destroyed the feeling for me. It wasn't anything like Star Wars. It was something else and it wasn't good.\\n\\nIt's not Star Wars anymore.\\n\\nAll this bitching and griping won't matter right now though.\\n\\nIt won't matter for another 2 years. It won't matter because this movie will still make tons of money because it appealed to the lowest common denominator. It won't matter now because Disney will make $1-$2 billion on TLJ and they won't care. For now...\\n\\nDisney chose quantity over quality.\\n\\nIf they don't fix it they will lose 50% of their Star Wars fanbase.\\n\\nBut they will care in 2019 when Episode 9 is released. That's when they will realize they fucked up. When it hurts their bottom line. Their mistake will hurt them in 2019 with lower opening weekend ticket sales.\\n\\nThey chose to ignore 50% of their fanbase.\\n\\n50% of fans aren't wrong.\\n\\nWe will remember when it comes to buying tickets in 2019.","true":true}
