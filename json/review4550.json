Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematography was nice but this movie was awful. Everything the Force Awakens set up was destroyed by the Last Jedi. To top this all off I never write reviews but the hatred I have for this movie would turn me to the Dark Side. I FEARed watching this movie because I new this movie would make or break the trilogy\\, Lea flying led to ANGER\\, green milk turned to HATE\\, Luke dying led to SUFFERING.","true":true}
