Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A film that lives up to the legacy of Star Wars and gives it new life. Luke's arc is great and handled with aplomb. Rey is still a bit too perfect\\, but it doesn't detract. The casino scenes are both good and awful. I wish they could have found a better way to explore that subplot.\\n\\nAll told\\, this film reaches some of the best highs of any of the star wars movies.  It  isn't a copy like Force Awakens was\\, even though it shared some superficial beats to Empire.\\n\\nCan't wait to see Rian Johnson's new trilogy! If it follows in the path of Last Jedi then I'm sure it will be great too!","true":true}
