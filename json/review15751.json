Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie\\, the star wars storyline continues with unimaginable plot twists\\, and characters full with depth (and great acting).  Though what I loved most were the morals\\, more strong female actresses\\, and representation in backgrounds and of the span of human emotions.","true":true}
