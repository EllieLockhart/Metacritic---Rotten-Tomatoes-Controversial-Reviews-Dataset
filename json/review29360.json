{"101487":165035,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson completely ruined the Star Wars franchise. Character assassinations of everyone.  How they managed to make Poe seem hotheaded next to the kylo ren the raging loserman is like\\, honestly impressive. Also wild how ryan johnson got away with using the protagonist\\, the hero of the trilogy\\, to prop up his gratuitous redemption fantasy of kyle. Like\\, give me one example of how Rey's character developed. I'll wait. In fact\\, give me one example of how anyone's character developed\\, INCLUDING ryan \\\"there is no difference between good and bad things\\\" johnson's kyloboy. There's nothing revolutionary about the idea that we should prioritize a man's \/feelings\/ over (in the context of star wars) literally the lives of everyone in galaxy. Also let's talk about this rose-finn kiss. 1. It's now apparent that Rose's purpose as a character is to facilitate finn's character growth (independent of the kiss)\\, and repel those Crazy lgbt fans who thought for one second that a star wars character could be gay \\n2. If JJ turns it around in IX\\, then Rose\\, the only woman of color in the main ensemble\\, becomes something that's getting in the way of a man's relationship (a gay relationship\\, but like\\, nobody wins).\\nThe ONLY moral statements that the movie attempts to make are \\n1. Being a hero for the sake of being a hero is bad (like\\, ok\\, true\\, but you can't say this and then only IMPLY that being a hero isn't wholesale a bad thing. Not enough glorification of good people doing good things \\n2. That both sides are bad in wars because they both buy from the hyper rich arms dealers\\, the only one who wins in the end are the people who know how to play the system (which actually means that the arms dealers are good anyway????) Like they try to make this commentary about class disparities and the hyper-rich\\, but then they go nihilistic with it and say that none of it really matters so you might as well take advantage of whoever you can. The movie rewards the two-timing codebreaker and punishes the heroes. Totally out of balance. \\n3. Bad guys aren't really that bad and if someone is being manipulative and abusive hey :\/ they probably had a bad childhood or something :\/ it's not their fault :\/ it's your job to expend your emotional labor to try to understand them\\, because if someone is abusive it's not their fault and they're actually good people\\, aside from wanting to control you and separate you from your friends and family (WHICH KYLO LITERALLY TRIES TO DO by telling rey that she needs to \\\"leave everything behind\\\")\\\"\\n\\nIn TFA they did a really good job with Kylo Ren. Not as a villain\\, but as a commentary on white angry nerd boys. They made the villain toxic and manipulative and angry in a very human way. The problem with TLJ is that it takes that\\, and says that because Kylo Ren has human flaws\\, he deserves sympathy. It absolves him of all responsibility for his actions. TLJ is bad because it doesn't condemn Kylo's abusive actions. It vindicates him.","true":true}
