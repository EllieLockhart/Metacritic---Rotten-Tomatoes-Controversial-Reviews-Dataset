Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never had a Facebook\\, Twitter\\, Instagram account etc. but felt compelled to sign up for this site to give a 1 star rating for this film. \\nDisappointed is an understatement.\\nYou can read what 99% of the other negative reviews have to say so i won't be redundant but to sum up; visuals and acting are superb. Other than that\\, huge plot holes\\, bad slapstick comedy\\, incompetent leaders\\, wasted adventures\\, absolutely no back story for major villains\\, Leia is space Mary Poppins\\, Luke is a space cow milk-drinking hologram coward\\, Force wielders can now; create clouds and zap trees with lightning even after they are dead\\, fly\/breathe through space\\, talk\/touch each other even though they are galaxies apart\\, take down trained soldiers even though they've had no lessons with a lightsaber\\, and on and on. \\nFor those of you who say people don't like the movie because it has a PC  agenda\\, you are incorrect. It was great to see such a diverse cast and many powerful roles played by women. There are plenty of diversely casted movies that are getting great reviews as of this week. \\nThe issue is that this movie just sucks and has taken so much joy out of a franchise that has brought us a lifetime of joy.","true":true}
