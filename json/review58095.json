Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film ever! The entire movie is about undoing everything that The Force Awakens has previously established in the first film. It has nothing to do with the bigger picture\\, now it's on episode 9 to do all the heavy lifting to fix all the new loose ends and to wrap up two movies worth of content in a single 3 hour movie. Sure the cinematics were great\\, but the story was absolutely lazy ignorant and pointless to say the least!! Btw\\, this has nothing to do with the story not \\\"going my way\\\". The story sucked because it was poorly written. Once a the world and people are established\\, the characters basically write themselves\\, you can't change a characters entire personality just to subvert ecxpectations! Like George RR Martin said\\, \\\"I've been planting all these clues that the butler did it\\, then you're halfway through a series and suddenly thousands of people have figured out that the butler did it\\, and then you say the chambermaid did it? No\\, you can't do that.\\\" \\n\\n Disney could have put this entire movie in a 10 minute short film where snoke dies and then Luke dies\\, and with all the stuff from VII that Johnson threw out the window\\, we have now went backwards in the story. Giving Rian Johnson complete creative control to do whatever he wanted is the reason this movie has the lowest rating of any Star Wars related film or tv show ever..","true":true}
