Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoilers be warned*\\n It pissed me off how they killed Snoke when they never explain where the fuck he even came from...that whole canto bight BS was so pointless the movie grinds to a halt whenever we're with Finn and Rose\\, and it was a totally unnecessary subplot. All they had to do was have Vice Admiral Holdo tell Poe about Leia's plan to use the smaller ships and he never would've sent off Finn and Rose to that damn planet!! Dumb af. Not to mention that if Finn hadn't left they would have never told Deejay (Benicio del Toro) about their plan\\, so the first order would have never tried to blow up the ships!! So they would've escaped without being found!! So the more you think about it the more you realize the movie has a lot of plot holes and unnecessary subplots\\, had they cut out all of the canto bight stuff the movie would've been a lot better","true":true}
