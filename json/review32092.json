Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers. \\nthis film has a lazy story whit a lot off plot hole and don't even bother to fix som silly think in movie. the humor is force in movie and fall flat\\, wish is ruin this movie tone. rey is somehow strong that Luke without any training.\\nhe's only the strongest jedi ever. then there is Lea flying in space in. all end all. this moive destroy the star wars magie for me.","true":true}
