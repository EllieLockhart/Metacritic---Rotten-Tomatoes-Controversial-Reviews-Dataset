Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just plain bad. I went in with even keeled expectations and walked out extremely disappointed. They introduce a character in The Force Awakens just to have that person be executed without any back story whatsoever. Lots of plot holes to add on\\, and that was only one of them. I truly feel sorry for the fans because they didn't get the movie they deserved.","true":true}
