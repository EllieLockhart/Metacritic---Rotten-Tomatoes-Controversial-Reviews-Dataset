Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it...but was disappointed with what I thought might happen and what did....the humor was my kind of humor...and there was maybe a few things that I had to just live with....Mary Poppins in space (Ploo Koon did this in CW) and Luke tossing the laser sword ... So much better the 2nd time after I could get over myself and my predictions and just enjoy the movie....plot holes...every Star Wars has plot holes!","true":true}
