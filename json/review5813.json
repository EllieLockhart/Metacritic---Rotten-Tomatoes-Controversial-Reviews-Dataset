Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointed!!! I would give it ZERO stars if possible. The film was too Marvel\\, too much humor for a dark tone film in the franchise. To make matter worse\\, most of the jokes weren't even funny. Really dislike the fact that Luke Skywalker was written into a rather coward-like figure\\, Rian Johnson clearly didn't know what kind of a person Luke Skywalker is before directing this movie. And the protagonist\\, aka Rey\\, was such a Mary Sue. But to be fair\\, the visual effect was beautiful\\, stunning. However\\, it got wasted by terrible storylines and terrible characters. Overall\\, the film itself didn't deserve to be titled \\\"Star Wars\\\".","true":true}
