Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh. No back story. None. You just can't do that with a Star Wars movie. At least Lucas had an old Obi Wan tell Luke about the past and palpTine tell Anakin about the past. We couldn't get a 30 second explanation of where the first order came from or who snoke was?","true":true}
