Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was a sorta enjoyable film at the beginning\\, however there are many times in the film that jarringly jerk you out of your suspension of disbelief. I'll not offer any spoilers however\\, some of the changes to characters seem to be made just so they can surprise the viewer as opposed to trying to tell a larger story. there are times the characters do things that make NO DAMN SENSE. while the message and portrayal of the characters is not what was expected\\, I have no issues with this... however the execution how events took place and why is a complete mess. A popcorn film to be sure... just not a good one.","true":true}
