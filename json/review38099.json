Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story outline was fine\\, but the tone and the portrayal of characters was very bizarre. I was constantly taken out of the settings in the movie saying aloud\\, did I really just see that or what is going on here. Felt like all of the established cannon was intentionally ignored or changed for shocks sake. Ive been a star wars fan for a long time\\, but legit have no desire or excitement to see the next one. By the end of the movie I sat discussing with my family and realized that I was a 33 year old father embarrassed to be carrying a lightsaber in public\\, which I doubt is what a movie (especially Star Wars) is supposed to leave you feeling.","true":true}
