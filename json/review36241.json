Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi will be the most fiercely debated and polarising Star Wars ever. Some of the humour and sequences are a bit off\\, but make no mistake\\, this is the most powerful Star Wars film ever made. The Last Jedi has some of the most epic moments and lore in the sagas history\\, coupled with amazing camera shots\\, an exciting plot\\, and the best character development it's ever seen in Ben and Rey. This is a very different Star Wars\\, and many fans will feel negatively towards it it; but there's no denying we begged Rian Johnson to take risks. The Last Jedi will stand alone as one of the most unique and memorable films in the saga and I only have praise for this.","true":true}
