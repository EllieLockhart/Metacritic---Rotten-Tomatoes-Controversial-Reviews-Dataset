Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed. For a movie with so much potential\\, it was very \\\"Ok\\\". The first 15 minutes were the best part of the entire film. I won't share spoilers\\, but I would suggest waiting for it to come out for rent. Not worth the $50 you spend going to a movie. My second to least favorite of any of the films.","true":true}
