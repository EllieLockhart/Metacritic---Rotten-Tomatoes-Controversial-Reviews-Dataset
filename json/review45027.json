Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Una profunda inmersi\u00f3n en el an\u00e1lisis de \\\"la fuerza\\\" \\, el origen de los Jedi y sus epifan\u00edas\\, y la situaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de la rep\u00fablica despu\u00e9s del exilio de Luke Skywalker","true":false}
