Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought this was a great edition to the star wars series and you should definitely see it. I loved that it kept the original star wars feel but didn't fall into using all of the same story tropes like Ep 7\\, which kept it from being overly predictable. I think a lot of diehard fans are stuck on the old and wanted an Empire strikes Back remake but the fact that this movie didn't completely fallow that direction made me happy because we've already had that story and as much as I want the old star wars feel I want it with a fresh new story. I didn't give it 5 stars only because there were a few out of place moments that I think needed more explanation or set up but all in all an excellent film.","true":true}
