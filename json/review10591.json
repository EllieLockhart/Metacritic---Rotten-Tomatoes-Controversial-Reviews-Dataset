Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great visuals\\, Mark Hamill did amazing with what he was given. But this movie was totally horrible and not worthy of star wars. No character development\\, plotholes as big as a death star. Just about everything as already been said I guess\\, especially how they ruined Luke Skywalker. Will not watch future installments. No point and no interest after this complete trainwreck of a movie.","true":true}
