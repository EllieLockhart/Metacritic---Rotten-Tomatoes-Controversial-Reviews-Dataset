Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers\\, there are! At your own risk\\, proceed.\\n\\nI really enjoyed this film\\, though it wasn't without it's flaws. I always say more Star Wars is good Star Wars and I stand by this. You have to be TRYING to make a Star Wars addition that isn't worthwhile.\\n\\nThe plot of the film is good\\, with the resistance trying to break free of the First Order for much of the film. It's not bad\\, but the choice to make one of the main arcs with Finn and Rose turn out to be a poor outcome in the end lends to realism of the war but\\, to me\\, lessens their contributions\\, especially Poe who organized it.\\n\\nThe film has it's ups and downs but overall does a great job expanding the mythos. If I had any issues it would be in the direction. Not a bad director\\, but Johnson's style (or at least the writing) felt too much like the vernacular and mannerisms of modern Earth. Calling Phasma \\\"Chrome Dome\\\" was funny but doesn't feel like an insult stemming from this universe. This happens often\\, mostly in the use of humor. Star Wars is always humorous but the humor stems from THIS galaxy. Scruffy looking Nerf-herder is a prime example. A lot of the humor here didn't feel like it came from this world but our own.\\n\\nAnother issue I had was in one particular scene\\, the casino. The whole thing felt like it took place on Earth\\, similar to my point earlier. The games didn't seem foreign\\, the clothing was very rich elite Earth-like\\, and the general set design was too familiar. I don't recall champagne bottles and martini glasses in this galaxy. Would have been easy and necessary to make them look odd to Earth standards. The prequels did a great job of show rich cultures that all fit in this world\\, not our own.\\n\\nI think visually the film lacked in \\\"Star Warsy\\\" tone. I don't know if it's the use of HD cameras or the direction but things just seemed off. Even when using practical effects! Something about the way the film was shot sticks out to me\\, and I didn't have this feeling watching Force Awakens of Rogue One. Hard to put my finger on it but\\, while the film isn't bad in this department\\, I think direction wasn't as good as it could be.\\n\\nFor the few lows\\, though\\, the highs hit GREAT! Kylo and Rey's arc is very interesting and I eagerly await more!  But particularly in Luke's scenes I was hooked. I won't go into them here\\, but Luke's arc was definitely my favourite part of the film! Especially towards the end!\\n\\nOverall\\, it's definitely enjoyable but I have my reservations. There will always be haters and cynics but even with my few issues I always am optimistic. After all\\, isn't hope the core message of the series?\\n\\nJust keep giving me more Star Wars and I'll be happy\\, always.","true":true}
