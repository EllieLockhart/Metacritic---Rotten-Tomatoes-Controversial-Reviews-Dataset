Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie is bad just bad and I feel betrayed honestly because they took a franchise that I loved as a kid and turned it into this mess damn you Rita Johnson & Disney for destroying the world that was Star Wars. I just want to see a Jedi with a damn light saber I didn't think it'd be that hard to ask for. But instead we get these \\\"story lines\\\" that have no meaning to the main characters. Look all I'm saying is I could've made a better story or you or your nerd cousin anything would've been better than this mess","true":true}
