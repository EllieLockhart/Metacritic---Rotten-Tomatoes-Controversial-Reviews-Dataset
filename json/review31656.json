Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So over used already\\, but as accurate as it gets:  \\\"This is not going to go the way you think.\\\"  Besides one head-scratching flight through space that just didn't seem right and a stop at a casino that seemed like time filler; this is as good as a Star Wars movie gets. It is epic and fun and hits all the right notes.","true":true}
