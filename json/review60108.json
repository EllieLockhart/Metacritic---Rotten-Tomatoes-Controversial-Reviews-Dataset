I hate the lack of control or choice in this game. And I dont like the story. The gameplay is short simple and even dumbed-down. The creators clearly had a story to tell and that's fine. I just didn't enjoy it. In the end it was a game and not the end of the world if everyone liked or enjoyed it but it was not worth my money in the end and I feel like I wasted a lot of time feeling bad while playing it. I dont care about any of the controversial things in the characters themselves I dont have a problem with different people and their ideas or how they live their lives. But my problem is not letting us have control over the final choice because I would have killed abby just because I put myself in the character when I play games and you could say that abby killed my Joel self and my Ellie self wanted to kill her and even my abby self couldn't avoid committing suicide repeatedly during her easy linear gameplay that soon feeds you items on the path you are on.  It's almost like they didn't want you to ignore her and proceed directly to the end my first moments as abby I didn't do anything just let the scene take place with all the action going on and people on horse back trying to kill me I just sat there the game literally broke my desire to play. My first real enthusiastic act as abby was to plummet to my death repeatedly.  I know a zero seems harsh like I should rate on story graphics gameplay etc. But I did and honestly the one thing in this game that makes it bad for me is bad enough to render all other positives null and void\\, let me kill abby. Ellie may know forgiveness but I dont care and still want her dead.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
