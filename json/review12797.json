{"101487":130420,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did like the characters and I did think the special effects were good\\, but I still think The Last Jedi\\, to me\\, is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Let me give you a quick analogy to explain why. \\n\\nWhat do you think Harry Potter fans would have thought if J.K. Rowling sold the rights to her books after book 4 or 5 and the person who bought the rights made new version of Harry that seemed unrecognizable - having Harry think that one of Ron's brothers was going bad and have Harry decided to sneak into his bedroom with intentions to murdering him in his sleep. And then have Harry run away to some remote location never wanting to help or have contact with people ever again.  The world J.K. Rowlings created has the chance of being thought of as a classic\\, like The Wizard of OZ was in its time. That possibility would have been lost if what was done to Star Wars was done to the world she created.\\n\\nHaving new characters are great\\, and introducing some different into a story is good\\, but not at the expense of destroying the story line or making characters untrue to what we know they should be like.\\n\\nLuke would never think of Murder. Luke would never run away from helping his friends and innocent people fight evil. I like Rey\\, I like Poe\\, Fin and they could have done so much more with Snoke and Knights of the Ren. \\n\\nThey could have:\\n\\n1) Explore Snoke's Background - who is he? They could have  made him something different from the emperor. Maybe not even a Sith\\, but something we have never seen before - which would explain why we don't know who he is. This would give it the uniqueness that some people craved and give Disney what they crave\\, a way to do even more spinoffs.\\n\\n2) Explore the Knights of the Ren - could have been related to Snoke's background and made it into something new that nobody has seen before - not even Luke. A new type of force user - different\\, but still have some of the skills of what we are used to\\, so we can have some fights with lightsabers. Oh and finally explain the different colors of a lightsabers - like they do in the Star Wars Universe books - and so all fans\\, even the ones that have not read the books\\, could learn that each color is for a different type of force user - which could have given Disney even more possible spinoffs. And would have gotten some Star Wars fans even more excited about new possible Star Wars movies\\, since it would more deeply explore Jedi and the force.\\n\\n3) A better explanation of why Luke went to that remote world to live on an Island.  Something more true to what his character would have been like. A better explanation is that Luke could have sensed and realized that the reason he failed with Kylo is because he was going up against something he has no experience with. That Snoke was something completely different that he did not know how to fight. So he sought out to find the First Jedi Temple in hopes of learning what this new threat is and how to combat it. \\n\\n4) Explore Rey's parentage better and not just leave it as scavenger parents that  as Kylo put it (has no place in this story). We could have learned that Kylo killed not only Luke's students\\, but his wife and children. But one of these children was Rey. Kylo could have been extra close to her and not being fully committed to the dark side yet\\, could not get himself to kill her\\, so it was  him that put her in the middle of nowhere to keep her out the way and not have to face killing her.\\n\\nWe could have learned that the force started to finally manifest in  her\\, to help guide her to Luke\\, which she would later learn was her father. And by the time she found him\\, Luke could have learned from the ancient Jedi texts what this new threat was and how to combat it. Luke could have then trained her fully.\\n.\\n5) Then TOGETHER (old doesn't mean your useless)\\, have Luke and Rey together fight - there can be more than one hero. Luke could have took on Snoke and Rey  fight Kylo or some sort of back to back partner fighting. And yes maybe Luke does die in this battle\\, but he does so to save Rey\\, his daughter and he at least is able to take out Snoke in the process.\\n\\n6) The final movie could have been all about Rey vs Kylo and the Knights of the Ren.\\n\\nA movie like that would still let us have had new things\\, new characters\\, and a way for Disney to have a ton of more spin-offs without destroying Luke's character and the way force sensitive users have to learn how to be Jedi. We could have had the both of best worlds and no fan would have been insulted. It could have been as good or better than the originals (and not just to some\\, but to most fans). \\n\\nInstead we got this character destroying\\, storyline destroying movie.","true":true}
