Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's like the \\\"critics\\\" know nothing about why fans like movies.\\n\\nIf you are a true fan of the TOHO Godzilla movies\\, you will like the new movie.\\n\\nThe \\\"Critics\\\" complain about he human characters but praise the Monster action. Um well\\, Godzilla is the main hero of the movie. Some also say there's a weak plot. Hello\\, its a Godzilla Movie\\, its like these people have never seen any of the previous 30+ other Godzilla movies. These \\\"Critics\\\" are the same ones who said Last Jedi was a good movie\\, then attacked the Fanboys. That's funny because if Lucasfilm would have done with the new trilogy that Godzilla: King of the Monsters did with this movie\\, there would have been no Solo boycott and Disney would not of had to put on hold all there other Star Wars movies.\\n\\nOr maybe its really is all political. Last Jedi was praised by the critics because if its diverse cast and strong female lead. Godzilla's antagonist is an eco-terrorist.","true":true}
