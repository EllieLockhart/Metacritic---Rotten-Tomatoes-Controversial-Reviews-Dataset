Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My spoiler-free review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi - the way so many of the dangling plot threads from 'The Force Awakens' are just thrown away with a visible contempt by new director Rian Johnson is disappointing. The fact that they don't have an overall arc for where this story is going is starting to become clearer.","true":true}
