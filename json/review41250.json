Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is absolute garbage. There's a reason Mark Hamill hates it. Also\\, there is no secret campaign to negatively review this movie. When you betray everything that Star Wars IV\\, V\\, and VI ARE\\, you alienate the fan base and kiss their loyalty goodbye. DON'T WATCH IT. I will never pay to see another movie masquerade as a Star Wars film again.","true":true}
