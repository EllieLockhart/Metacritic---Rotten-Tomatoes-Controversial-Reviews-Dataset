Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was an afront to everything Star Wars: The Force Awakens set up. Plots dropped\\, characters not further developed or altogether  replaced with new\\, poorly casted actors. Luke Skywalker reappearing on the big screen was supposed to be an epic adventure\\, however he ended up being one of the most frustrating disappointments in this new Star Wars episode.","true":true}
