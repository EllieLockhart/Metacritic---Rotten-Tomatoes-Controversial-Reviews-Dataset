Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the action\/acting\/new ideas were good but was overshadowed by how they killed the original plot and prolonged the subplot. The jokes were ill placed. The series would survive if Last Jedi did not have soo many plot holes and tone change in major characters like Luke. They lost fans and regular movie goers are never going to appreciate the characters enough to see it again. btw I noticed people are saying it didn't answer why Kylo and Rey were force talking...Snoke connected Kylo and Rey with his use of the force\\, he confessed this during the torture scene in his chamber\\, to see if Kylo would bring Rey to him. Which is another plot hole\\, cause Snoke could have just force contacted Luke and kill him with a Darth Vader force chocking move\\, the one he does In The Empire Strikes Back. Kylo and Snoke also had no idea where Rey was and if she was even a big enough threat at the time so why waste the time. It just leaves so much to question on Snoke's true motives and why he was so powerful\\, even more than Yoda in his prime\\, so they just killed em off. Lazy writing.?","true":true}
