Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the film. Very entertaining. Seems the bad reviews come from people who thought their theories were going to be right and Johnson did something totally different. The only problem I have with the new trilogy so far is that they squandered showing the original 3 characters together. They should have had a moment between Han & Luke in The Force Awakens. Anyone that says this movie is worse than the prequels clearly has zero taste.","true":true}
