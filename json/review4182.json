Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By and far the worst Star Wars movie in the franchise\\, filled with plot holes\\, no character development. A major character is written and acts to contradict his entire backstory which is well documented on film. I know when I finished watching the movie and felt nothing\\, that this was not a good movie. Though this film contains two of arguably the best scenes ever filmed in the franchise ever\\, the Luke milking scene and the Rose Finn battlefield scene. Hands down two of the best scenes ever filmed in the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
