Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am sorry to say this\\, screw the haters\\, yes the films not perfect\\, but I personally was in love with it\\, I think Rian Johnson's choices were hard to come by with fans \\, but it made me feel\\, I love this film??","true":true}
