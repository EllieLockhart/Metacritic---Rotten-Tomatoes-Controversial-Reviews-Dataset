Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I dare any of these \\\"critics\\\" to tell me with a straight face they were not paid or pressured to give this movie a good review.\\n\\nBad Pacing\\nBad Plot\\nPlotholes like you cannot imagine\\nComedy falls absolutely flat\\nNo payoff of any buildup in previous film...(this is not subversive this is stupid)\\n\\nAt one point in this movie I saw the glimmer of hope...the ability to tie in all the Star Wars movies AND take it in a great direction...AAAAAANNNNND then it was all thrown away...\\n\\nIf there had never been another star wars movie this one gets a 2.5\/5  taken in the larger context of what it could have been and what it ruined (kill the past amirite?) it gets a 0.5\/5\\n\\nPut a fork in it...any hype for Star Wars from here on out is a Disney manufactured lie.  Just like the reviews for this film are.","true":true}
