Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best star wars since empire strikes back? Yes it surely is. I don't know why there's so many haters that show up at Star Wars The Last Jedi \\\"user\\\" reviews. I think they just see a chance to bring the movie down. Maybe because of the previous news that some theaters banned Star Wars for screening because of Disney's overwhelming request. Or maybe there are too many mediocre reviewer nowadays who prefer junk movie like justice league to high quality movie like star wars (you can see the \\\"user\\\" review at rotten tomatoes for both film which I think is insane). My advise if you want to watch TLJ: don't trust the user review\\, you better check the real critic's review.","true":true}
