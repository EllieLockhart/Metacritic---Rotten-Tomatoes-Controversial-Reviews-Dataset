Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While not being the best Star Wars movie\\, it's pretty far from being the worst. Grouchy Luke was fun\\, Kylo's rise to power was clever\\, & Leia was awesome. New character Rose was brilliant\\, need more of her. I was a little disappointed with Poe's arc\\, his plan was a wild goose chase. Overall\\, I was very happy with it.","true":true}
