{"101487":182076,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-15","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is easily\\, without contest\\, the best movie since Episode V. I absolutely loved it\\, and I've watched each movie in the series a minimum of 10 times. I also liked the \\\"non-Canon\\\" games\\, books\\, and tv shows that \\\"real fans\\\" will tell you are nothing but another merchandising ploy. Ok\\, whatever. If you are that hostile to new Star Wars content then maybe stick to the original trilogy and leave the rest of it to those of us who can appreciate entertainment for what it is. I can't even remotely empathize with the majority of complaints that I've read lodged against this film\\, much less make sense of the abysmal audience score here on Rotten Tomatoes. I hope that over time\\, people will come to see The Last Jedi for what it truly is: a cinematic and storytelling masterpiece.","true":true}
