Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Entertaining with amazing moments and maybe some of the coolest things that you\u2019ve seen yet in a Star Wars movie. Weighed down by some serious plot holes and cheap plot devices that feel unneeded and in some ways leaves you with unsatisfying answers or more questions than you had before. I don\u2019t understand people who think the prequels were better or say this is the worst Star Wars film because the highs were some of the best moments in the franchise but the lows keep it from reaching the same level of enjoyment I got from the original trilogy or even The Force Awakens or or Rogue One.","true":true}
