Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I want to give this less that 1 star\\, but can't due to the rating system. The story is absolutely bloody awful\\, it makes no sense\\, breaks all the rules of the Star Wars universe\\, in fact its so bad it has ruined the franchise. This film is not canon IMO.","true":true}
