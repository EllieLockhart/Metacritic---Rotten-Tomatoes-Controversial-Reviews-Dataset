Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Where can I start with this movie.? After seeing all the bad reviews\\, and all the news outlets saying it just isn't so and it's \\\"a crusade by fanatics\\\". I had to see for myself\\, I love star wars religiously\\, such a deep rich universe with great character development and so much imagination. Then there is \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"\\, more like \\\"The last star wars film I will watch\\\". First movie I won't even consider cannon. Zero character development\\, normal people becoming space gods\\, an enemy that can't adhere to their convictions. Suffice to say this movie is promoting an agenda and not a story\\, it is trying to invent problems that never needed to exist just so certain characters can look likebthey are on the moral high ground without actually doing anything of worth. One only needs to look at the writing team to understand how this happened. What a galatic joke.","true":true}
