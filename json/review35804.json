Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is terrible. So many plot holes\\, it sinks to the bottom of my Star Wars totem pole. There were some good moments. But overall\\, just a mess. Luke deserved better. This movie was so hyped and falls way short. Disney will no doubt try to defend this stinking turd of a movie. You have lost a fan. Mark Hamill ... your instincts were right ... this is not the movie most fans wanted to see","true":true}
