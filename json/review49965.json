Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"You must unlearn what you have learned\\\"  I loved this movie and this quote from Yoda in 1980 really sums it up for me.  It takes things in an exciting new direction.  I love where this is going and I am do glad Rian Johnson gets a whole trilogy to create.  It should be surprising just like this movie was.","true":true}
