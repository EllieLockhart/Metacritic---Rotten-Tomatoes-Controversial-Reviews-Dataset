Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Reviewed 12.16.17. I've come to a conclusion. It is impossible to please aging Star War's fans. A new installment is never going to mean as much to you as the originals did when you were ten years old. Accept it. At the screening I attended\\, kids loved it. Are these new installments perfect? No. And neither was the original trilogy. Blasphemy? Watch them again\\, critiquing them as you would a new release. They are full of implausible moments and cheesy dialogue too. But they were highly entertaining nonetheless.  And so is The Last Jedi. They could have written it a thousand ways. And if I was choosing\\, I'd have done it differently too. But it's as captivating as any of the original movies\\, if you can return to your inner child.","true":true}
