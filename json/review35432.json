Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"THE LAST JEDI continues the Star Wars sequel trilogy's thematic exploration of generationality and the past\\, present\\, and future. While THE FORCE AWAKENS focused on \\\"past\\\" in a rather direct way\\, emulating the story of STAR WARS (1977) in new contexts with new characters\\,  JEDI attempts to bridge past\\, present\\, and future organically\\, in a narrative primarily focused on the nature of past institutions\\, present ambitions\\, and hope for the future. I am unsure of the direction the franchise will take here\\, and thus JEDI's place among the films is uncertain until EPISODE IX releases in two years\\, but on its own merit\\, THE LAST JEDI is inventive\\, resonant\\, and fantastically entertaining.","true":true}
