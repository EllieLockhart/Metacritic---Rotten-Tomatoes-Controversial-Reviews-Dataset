Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An incredibly disappointing addition to the Star Wars saga. The Last Jedi is full of plot holes\\, characters making bad decisions\\, and \\\"twists\\\" that can be seen from a mile away. As someone who went to the opening\\, midnight screening I walked away wishing I'd waited or not bothered at all.","true":true}
