Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Nothing I can say that isn't already in the other negative reviews. This movie attempts to taint the memory of the Star Wars like no other novel\\, video game or Christmas special has. My young kids and I hated it. Has caused them to lose interest in Star Wars.","true":true}
