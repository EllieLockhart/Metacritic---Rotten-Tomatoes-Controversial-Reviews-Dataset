{"101487":105796,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-05-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As much as there is to admire in some of the visuals on display in The Last Jedi\\, the pacing\\, editing decisions\\, runtime\\, and misuse and abuse of some central characters makes this the first Star Wars film I actively wish I hadn't seen.\\n\\nThe entire premise of a chase movie is not a bad one\\, but is implemented so artlessly\\, with so little tension\\, so little narrative drive\\, and so much drag on the pace of the film it became a source of genuine amazement. Not amazement at drama or visual spectacle\\, just amazement at every time the film cut back to this tedious\\, drawn out\\, bafflingly slow and bafflingly long pursuit that this boring plot device was still rumbling along like an old man on a squeaky bicycle for nearly two hours. Battlestar Galactica (both versions) was doing this exact premise in a genuinely interesting and exciting way over a decade ago (or 4 decades ago for some of us)\\, and it was doing so an entire order of magnitude better than the efforts the audience had to endure in The Last Jedi.\\n\\nPoe Dameron\\, a bold\\, intelligent character\\, who managed to find the data that helped locate Luke in (The Force Awakens)\\, and led TWO successful assaults against vastly superior First Order forces\\, was ret-conned into a glory seeking fool so that he could be slapped down (literally\\, 40 times if you watch the special features) to make female characters look better. This is not female empowerment\\, Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley was kicking ass as an amazing woman in sci-fi\\, and doing much better at it than the amateur hour antics being pushed as \\\"strong women\\\" in this film. Hell\\, Princess Leia herself was a character with guts\\, intellect\\, agency\\, and sass from the get-go in Episode 4\\, these developments are unworthy of the character. Any person with a scrap of decency in them knows that somebody who has to make somebody else look bad to make themselves seem good is not a person who deserves admiration. The film is rife with this.\\n\\nFinn too was reduced to a joke. In The Force wakens he was brave\\, decisive\\, adaptable\\, and even when he was totally out of his depth he found resources and strength he didn't know he had in him. In TLJ he is made a mockery of\\, bossed around\\, stunned\\, sent off on a tedious side-quest\\, and is robbed of a moment of pure self-sacrifice for\\, well\\, Rose's reasons. The deleted scenes section shows he had a great deal more to offer the story than we were allowed to see\\, and it is astonishing that so many moments that would have helped the flow of the story a great deal were cut when so much tedium that adds nothing but a huge over-run to the films length remained in place.\\n\\nThe most egregious bit of character-sabotage is saved for the last Jedi himself. As many have noted\\, Luke Skywalker risked absolutely EVERYTHING to try to redeem his father in Return of the Jedi. Risking his own life\\, the lives of his friends\\, his sister\\, and risking the entire rebellion itself\\, to redeem someone who had spent decades being utterly corrupted by evil. That he would contemplate striking his own nephew dead as he slept\\, because he sensed he MIGHT turn bad was a grotesque abuse of a character who has been a part of the lives of some fans for over 40 years. I can only characterise the treatment of the entire legacy of the franchise -as summed up in this lead-footed convenience plotting- as nothing short of a betrayal. It is ample evidence this franchise is in the hands of people unfit to handle it.\\n\\nAs for the claims it is original\\, subverts expectations\\, or is a welcome blank slate for the writer-director\\, well\\, let's address the last point first. A blank slate is not necessarily a bad thing for the franchise\\, but if there was to be a blank slate\\, it should have been at the start of a new trilogy\\, not slap bang in the middle of one which has done a great deal of establishing work which has been unceremoniously ejected to serve the ego of the man at the helm. What can possibly said to be original about this film? It borrows heavily from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi\\, with entire scenes lifted or rehashed\\, and simply switching the outcome to claim this \\\"subverts expectations.\\\" Hey\\, remember when Luke had a shocking revelation about his parentage? Same\\, only opposite! The script is stuffed with this cheap hackery.\\n\\nI could go on about flying Leia\\, Canto Bight\\, how boring and stale Rey has become\\, how obvious an attempt to curry favour with Chinese filmgoers Rose Tico was (the movie was pulled from Chinese theatres after 2 weeks\\, maybe they noticed Kelly Marie Tran is Vietnamese? They don't all look the same\\, you know)\\, killing off Snoke without ever explaining where he came from\\, or Luke's taste for Sea-cow milk\\, but there's already been much coverage of all of that. Same goes for The Amazing Captain Phasma! who it turns out is still just as ineffectual an embarrassment to the First Order as she was in Episode VII. She only became remotely interesting in the deleted scene where Finn calls her out as a coward who got Starkiller Base (and presumably thousands of First Order troops) blown to smithereens.\\n\\nI could have merely written it off as a bad Star Wars film (I didn't actually like Return of the Jedi very much when it came out\\, stupid Ewoks!) but the thing that has really soured me on this film\\, and the entire franchise while it remains in the hands of the people currently mismanaging it\\, is the ugly\\, disrespectful and deceitful attempts to control the narrative about why and who it is who do not like the film. Attempting to characterise the filmgoers as misogynists\\, racists\\, and all manner of other ugly accusations. This is amplified by a media so keen to curry favour with Disney\\, who now control so many of the big-budget IP that fans want to know about. The prize of early screenings\\, early access\\, exclusive information about hot upcoming releases is gold to sites\\, reviewers\\, bloggers\\, vloggers and other hangers on who monetise their vapid output off the back of these big properties\\, so the motivation to tow Disney's line is irresistible. This could not be more obvious when seeing the massive disconnect between the reviews on this very site. The disparity between \\\"professional\\\" reviewers and the cinema-going public could not be more stark\\, or disturbing. \\n\\nWhile the way RotToms distributes reviews into the tomatometer does not make it a metareview system\\, it is still deeply disturbing to see how untrustworthy vast swathes of the media must now be as a measure of what the public can expect to enjoy or dislike. Much like the Ghostbusters 2016 remake\\, with its own disingenuous\\, phoney\\, studio led and commercially motivated narrative about misogyny and racism\\, there is a huge disconnect between the \\\"proper\\\" reviews and audience reactions to what is another\\, objectively poor film.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is The Last Star Wars film I will pay money to see\\, and I have seen every single one since 1977. I love films with female protagonists\\, I love a good\\, tense space-chase (So say we all!)\\, I love lightsaber battles and dazzling combat\\, and yet\\, I genuinely dislike this film. I hope J.J. Abrams can redeem the series\\, but I sincerely doubt it.","true":true}
