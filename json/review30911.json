Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So close but still no cigar! There were elements of this movie that had me almost out of my seat and cheering! But then! Oh! BUT THEN..... Thej the makers missed the mark and I walked out of the movie feeling disappointed and a little shell shocked. I wish that I could sit all of the writers down and teach them what Star Wars is all about. It is NOT just a movie but a mythology all its own. And it seems that the writers went into this movie with only a base understanding of any of it. There are people who have seen Stat Wars and then there are people who LOVE Star Wars- who have studied the mythology for decades. The writers belong to the first category. And if you belong to the second then you will likely also leave the theater extremely disappointed.","true":true}
