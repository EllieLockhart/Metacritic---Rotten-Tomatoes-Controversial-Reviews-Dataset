Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars entry excluding the prequels.  Weirdly paced\\, underwhelming visuals\\, too many characters to focus on\\, boring subplots\\, poorly executed comedy\\, and a ridiculous amount of deus ex machina.  The only thing this movie did well was it's execution of Kylo Ren's story.  [2\/10]","true":true}
