Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film ever. I'd rather watch the prequels back to back for a week than endure another sitting of this.\\nDialogue - terrible\\nNew characters - terrible\\nHumour - the theatre was full and no one was laughing\\nPlot - terrible\\nAbuse of established characters? - Horrific!\\nDisney destroying this once great franchise. George Lucas how I miss you.","true":true}
