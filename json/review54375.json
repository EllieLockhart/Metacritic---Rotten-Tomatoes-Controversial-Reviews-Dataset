Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to admit that i went into this film with certain expectations given the way 7 ended. I felt it was very unrewarding given that there are things you expect from star wars such as light saber duels or further explanation of the force \/ force use. I watched an interview with Mark Hamill saying he was surprised with Rian Johnson's take on Luke Skywalker\\, and I have to agree. I had such hope that with this being the longest SW movie we would be introduced to a new depth of the force. Not only did they fail to do that\\, but i felt that this movie as a whole failed to convey any depth at all\\, for any character. All in all i feel that disney was overly involved or Rian Johnson was a poor choice as a director. \\n\\n\\n***spoiler alert**** \\n\\n\\n\\nYoda was the high light","true":true}
