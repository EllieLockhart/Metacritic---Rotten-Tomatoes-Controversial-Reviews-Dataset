Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1. George Lucas never would\u2019ve let us hanging with snoke like that. At least we saw Darth Maul fight somebody. 2. snoke dies\\, and kylo is slayin first order soldiers and Ray is struggling\\, after that Ray is suddenly equally as strong as Kylo when battling for the lightsaber?? 3. The entire story of Fin could\u2019ve and should\u2019ve been done w\/o Phasma and the new girl he was running around with. They are unnecessary parts of the plot going back to the force awakens 4. I understand Luke did the whole Ben Kenobi thing in a cooler way\\, but I didn\u2019t want to see him be a grumpy old man for 1.5 hrs 5. The entire part of the plot where the first order is following the rebellion until they run out of fuel was boring and uncreative 6. Leia is strong with the force yeah but not a Jedi. Cmon now 7. The kid at the end of the credits make me dislike it even more because this shouldve been a really dark movie like the empire strikes back\\, but it wasn\u2019t and they just had to squeeze heartfelt moments into the movie","true":true}
