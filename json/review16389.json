Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm really disappointed by this movie. I her it that Disney wants to reboot and make the story their own but.... They did so without recreating deep characters like Luke\\, Leiah\\, Han\\, etc... It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't kill them off. They took huge leaps that didn't make alot of sense: Yoda burning down the Jedi books\\, the fact there were Jedi books\\, where the heck did Snoke come from? and them he died\\, Like goes from cutting himself off from the force to astral projection\\, and finally; Kylo almost turned and then got sinister again. Dumb.","true":true}
