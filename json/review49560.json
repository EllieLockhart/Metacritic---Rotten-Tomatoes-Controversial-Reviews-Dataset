Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. Just bucket loads of stupid. This film was such a disjointed mess\\, I wouldn't know where to begin. The whole casino planet thing was the lamest thing ever seen in the franchise history. Worse than young Anakin's acting in Phantom Menace. Worse than Jar Jar. The sub-light speed chase? Holy crap. Dropping bombs in space where there is no gravity? Good grief. I'm reminded to the 2 word review of Spinal Tap's \\\"Shark Sandwich album. \\\"Sh*t Sandwich.\\\" That about sums it up.","true":true}
