Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved this movie. It does not deserve all of the hate it is getting. I saw New Hope at a drive-in in 1978 and have been a fan ever since then. I liked the fact that the director changed things up and he did an excellent job of setting the stage for future Star Wars movies.","true":true}
