Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The humor falls flat\\, plot holes are glaring\\, the villains are throw away reminesant of a super hero movie\\, and over all\\, doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie. A tremendous disservice has been done to older\\, and newer characters. This movie ignores or completely reversed things set up in the previous film; as well as ignoring some established mechanics of the Star Wars Universe. A main theme of the movie\\, which an entire plot line had been devoted to\\, seems to be to deliver the political message that slavery is bad\\, and people get rich off of war\\, and is being hailed as the most intellectual Star Wars movie because of it? It feels anything but; a disjointed and un-cohesive mess. The over 90% critic rating is insane\\, and goes to show you how much people are afraid to get blacklisted by Disney. I fear gone are the days of good story telling within the Star Wars Franchise\\, as they crank them out yearly like Pirates or Marvel.","true":true}
