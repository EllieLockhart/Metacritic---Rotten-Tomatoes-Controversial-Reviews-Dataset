Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"at MANY points in the movie you're gonna think shit is going down EXACTLY how you're so afraid it was gonna go. and then it laughs and goes \\\"nah lol we just fuckin with u\\\" and crushes that fear. 10\/10","true":true}
