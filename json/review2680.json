Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awesome visuals I've come to expect from the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately the story was too reminiscent of ESB and there were plot holes big enough for the Death Star to comfortably fly through. The only reason this review gets half a star is because of the Vulptex.","true":true}
