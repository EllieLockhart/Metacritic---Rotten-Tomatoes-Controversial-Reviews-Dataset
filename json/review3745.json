Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Better than The Force Awakens\\, but not easy to watch. You have to pay attention and they are obviously trying to move away from the Skywalkers. I liked how they are making the force more complicated\\, it's not just light and dark\\, it's more complicated. Rey is much more likeable in this movie\\, but Leia is muted\\, almost downplayed. It's sad\\, knowing this is her last movie. So far\\, my favorite of the new movies has been Rogue One\\, and it still is\\, but this at least makes me want more.","true":true}
