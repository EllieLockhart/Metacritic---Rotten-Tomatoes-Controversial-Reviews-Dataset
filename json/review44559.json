Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total disregard to the entire Star Wars franchise.  Please never allow Rian Johnson near Star Wars again. All he cared about was setting up his new trilogy. By doing so he has thrown out 40yrs of mythology.  I really hope Disney\/lucasfilms can undo the damage that has been done by this film but I doubt they can salvage it completely. Like the fans have already said\\, Luke Skywalker deserved better. The entire franchise deserved better. Don't bother wasting your money to see this in theaters.","true":true}
