Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Signed up to  leave a review.\\n\\nPeople are a bit to emotional\\, its not the worst movie ever made. It is however full of plot holes and twists that feels like they are there because writers could not agree or disney wanted to make more money\\,\\n\\nIt also feels like a film created to sell toys\\, there is a new ship here and a new ship there and since the BB-8 droid sold so well last time\\, now there are more useless critters everywhere to turn into toys.\\n\\nThe bad guy we knew nothing of that came out of nowhere is also just kiled off as soon as he appeared~ish. \\n\\nThe critics saw some other movie than the audience\\, hope Disney wont listen to them when deciding how to make the next movie...\\n\\nProbably even more new ships and critters that make no sense\\, i know people with lightsaber whips... oh wait","true":true}
