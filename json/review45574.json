Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing Lucasfilm. The biggest flaw The Last Jedi is that it underutilizes character potential and squanders what could\u2019ve been an engaging story in favor of a dull new cast that we learn nothing about and long slow moving scenes that add nothing to film. The movie essentially has a lot in common with the prequel trilogy in the sense that it makes similar mistakes in its direction which is a shame.","true":true}
