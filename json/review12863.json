Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn\u00b4t liked the Force Awakens (a reboot of \\\"A new Hope\\\" with the same plotholes and none of the originality!!) and was not holding great expectations for this movie\\, but it managed to be considerably worse than what I expected it to be - as a matter of fact\\, worse than all the prequels\\, worse SW movie ever\\, if we exclude of course SW Holiday Special... I\u00b4ve lost interest in watching the next movie\\, which for a die-hard SW fan like myself is almost unthinkable... probably time to grow up\\, I guess.\\nThe only hope now are the spin-off movies... \\\"Rogue One\\\" was great\\, best SW movie after the original trilogy... let\u00b4s hope the movie about Han Solo will be all right.","true":true}
