Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen\\, and that's saying a lot.   Star Wars has become a shell of itself\\, as it is politicized and dumbed down with one dimensional plot devices and characters\\, weak writing\\, and a lack of creativity and substance.  I walked out of the theater wondering if I was living in the movie \\\"Idiocracy\\\"\\, because all of the good reviews for the movie were completely misaligned with my own experience\\, as well as the experience of my buddy's who went into the theater with me.","true":true}
