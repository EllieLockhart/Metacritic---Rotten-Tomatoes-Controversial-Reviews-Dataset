Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie\\, but it lost me quickly. It is frankly hard to recall all of the outright stupid things that happen in this movie. There are some really great scenes throughout\\, but pretty much all of them are ruined by something dumb happening. Extremely disappointing.","true":true}
