Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is coming from a die hard star wars fan. Star Wars The Last Jedi is the worst Star wars movie. I give more respect to the prequels even The Phanton Menance in its effort towards to loyal fans. Disney has once again ruined one of the most beloved series of all time. They ruined the ultimate Jedi\\, The Chosen One\\, Luke Skywalker. They turned him into a coward\\, and a shadow of what was his former self in the original trilogy. They have major plot-holes that are worst than the prequels\\, and have a logic that is just absurd. The manage to waste potential great characters\\, and add an unnecessary quest in the middle of a situation that is supposed to have high tension. There are many things to be mad about in this movie\\, but overall it is a huge disappointment to Star Wars fans\\, and it completely tears down what happened in the original trilogy.","true":true}
