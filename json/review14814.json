Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have to say I was really hoping this would be a revival of Star Wars for me but it just felt so meh to me. The movie misses so very big plot point with not explaining who Snoke is. It also is another story of bad guys chasing them from escaping another base. I feel like they are still somewhat rehashing the first trilogy. I also just feel like it doesn\u2019t have that feeling of wow I really can\u2019t wait to watch it again. After watching this movie. I really have no desire to watch it again. It is very weird and odd to say but as time goes on. I am appreciative more and more of the prequels. I really hope episode IX is an improvement but I do not have much hope for it after this one. ","true":true}
