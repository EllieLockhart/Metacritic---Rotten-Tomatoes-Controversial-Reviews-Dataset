Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the movie that Star Wars fans feared when the franchise was sold to Disney. But then The Force Awakens and Rogue One were both really well made. Now they drop this Christmas turd on us.\\n The movie begins with a \\\"Yo Momma\\\" joke and the writing never gets much better from there. \\nThis thing was an hour too long and felt more like a quick-turnaround Avengers movie than a Star Wars film. \\nThe Snoke\\, Ren\\, Rey fight scene was the only memorable part of this. But you never learn who Snoke was or what motivated him. That's just poor storytelling.","true":true}
