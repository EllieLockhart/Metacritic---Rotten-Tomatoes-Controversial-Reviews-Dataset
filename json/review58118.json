Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie of all time\\, and worse\\, it has destroyed Star Wars. Disney are just in it for the money and don't care about it. I will not watch any star wars movies they make. I'm a lifelong huge fan and they managed to ruin the franchise. The story makes no sense\\, the whole movie is just lazy. It's so bad I no longer care about the new characters Abrams so carefully set up. Anyone who cares about what Star Wars was originally about will be insulted and disgusted with this whole pointless thing that can't even be called a movie. Disney killed Star Wars and a part of me died with it. Goodbye Disney.","true":true}
