{"101487":191043,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-11-03","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unlike what many fans have said\\, I enjoyed Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Visual Effects and Soundtrack are fantastic and I found the ending of the film perfect. However\\, there are some things that don't work\\, in particular the duel between the guards of Snoke and Rey and Kylo Ren and the scene in which Leia flies into space\\, at a time when Poe\\, Finn and the other members of the Resistance open the door of the control room to recover Leia how can they not be sucked out of space ?! The same in the sequence of bombers that I appreciated\\, how is it possible that Rose's sister doesn't fly out of the ship? My rating is 3.5 out of 5.","true":true}
