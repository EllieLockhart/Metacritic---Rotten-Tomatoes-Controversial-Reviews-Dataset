Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the best star wars films ever made period. it develops the established characters\\, puts luke skywalker in the best most realistic place he could be in his life\\, disregards all the unnecessary characters that were introduced in the last film and\\, most importantly\\, it takes a major dump on prequel fanboys' expectations","true":true}
