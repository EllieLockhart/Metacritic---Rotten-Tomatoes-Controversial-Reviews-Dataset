Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The single worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. As a huge fan of Star Wars this was a atrocious addition to the Star Wars movies overall. I wouldn't wish for anyone to see this movie. From certain people floating in space and miraculously surviving to certain people fighting against a galactic force by themselves without consequence to awful needless humor. For the love of god do not watch this film it will ruin Star Wars for you","true":true}
