Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Love it! But i'm a Star Wars Geek. Don't expect the typical Star Wars and go in with an open mind. Great plots...some parts were a bit over worked and not needed. Excellent developments from the last movie but still play thematically from Force Awakens. Long very very long but satisfying. This isn't an orginal trilogy movie and I think it does a good job of blending humor with seriousness and epicness of a star wars film. Twist and turns and i'll just say Kylo Ren is a delight to watch....","true":true}
