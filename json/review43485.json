Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a visually stunning picture\\, and that's about it.  They put out the money for visual effects. Its very beautiful to look at. Yet there is no substance to go with this movie. We got a  recycled movie here with aspects of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. George Lucas messed up selling to Disney. They dropped the ball on this. I'm too angry to got into detail but this. I've had a 25 year love affair with Star Wars and this makes me want to quit on Star Wars. JJ Abrams good luck.","true":true}
