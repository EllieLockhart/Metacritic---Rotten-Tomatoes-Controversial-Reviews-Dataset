Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed it and really don\u2019t get the fan complaints. Particularly\\, in TFW some people complained that \u201coh\\, it\u2019s too much like the originals.\u201d And now TLJ took some big risks (which I think paid off) and some of you are like \u201coh nooo\\, this isn\u2019t the Star Wars I\u2019m familiar with.\u201d You can\u2019t satisfy everyone\\, that\u2019s for sure. I think people need to experience the movie itself in order to form their own opinion. It\u2019s a worthy installment in this trilogy (although the Force Awakens is definitely a little bit stronger plot-wise)\\, BUT I still loved every moment of watching it. ****QUICK SPOILERS**** I do wish that we got to see more of Captain Phasma as I\u2019m a big fan of Gwendoline Christie (especially in Game of Thrones\\, go Brienne of Tarth wooo). Maybe she lived? I can only hope lol In addition\\, I just wanted to say that I love Rose (she\u2019s adorable) and the \u201cForce Skype\u201d scenes with Kylo and Rey were great. I look forward to seeing more of their connection in the next movie. ALSO\\, I was dying at how dramatic and sassy Luke was. Also Yoda. Enough said.","true":true}
