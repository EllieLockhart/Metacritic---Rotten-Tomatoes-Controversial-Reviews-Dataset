Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fun\\, exciting\\, lovingly characterized\\, but what really makes this installment shine is that it has substantial thematic content. \\n\\nJust as the original trilogy was a parable for Vietnam era America\\, The Last Jedi is a thoughtful sci-fi look at the  challenges that face Gen-Xers and Millenials as they inherit the failings of the Boomers. \\n\\nWonderful! Best Star Wars of our time.","true":true}
