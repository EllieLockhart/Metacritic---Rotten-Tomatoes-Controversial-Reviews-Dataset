Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People are being overly harsh to this film because of their personal feelings of what it should have been. It was a great film full of suspense\\, action and top rate performances by great actors - so go see it and judge for yourself rather than listen to fans of the franchise who didn't get their wish of a story line.","true":true}
