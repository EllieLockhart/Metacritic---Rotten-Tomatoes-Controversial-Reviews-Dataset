Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was an incoherent mess combined with lazy writing.  The inability \/ refusal to develop Snoke as a character is ground zero for the disappointment.  Snoke should have been a key cinematic legend\\,  and they simply jettisoned him for no other reason than they did not seem to want to develop him.  Same thing with Poe\\, Finn\\,  and they even simplified Rey by makin\\,g her a nobody.  This may be the only Star Wars movie that I don't buy a home version of.","true":true}
