Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thought it was a good film and enjoyed it. Some nice surprises and good emotive scenes such as the bombing run near the beginning giving a sense that this is war and the sacrifices made.  some bits i didn't like\\, but that maybe the fan part of me being unhappy\\, but over all it is a good film.","true":true}
