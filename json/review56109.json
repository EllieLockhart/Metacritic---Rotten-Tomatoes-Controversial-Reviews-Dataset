Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So so so disappointed. Was looking forward to this for so long. This not only was a bad Star Wars movie\\, but a bad movie in general...bad writing\\, bad acting\\, bad directing. I don't understand the 91% rating on here\\, and I don't understand what happened to the...oh\\, that's right\\, it was Disneyfied. Good job Rian Johnson\\, you killed Star Wars.","true":true}
