Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some really interesting ideas and thoughts but just not developed properly and stopping to think about it for more than a few minutes brings to mind the myriad and at times ridiculously stupid plot holes. Poor overall but doubly so because it squanders the decent potential it had.","true":true}
