Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SJW bulls!*$t and plot lines written without ADHD medication lead to one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in my life. Luke Skywalker\\, one of the most well known and beloved movie heroes\\, ruined. Rey\\, a Mary Sue\\, completely uncompelling and irrelevant. Laia\\, a space superman now? This movie was filled with crappy slap-stick humor and tragically missed potential. Mark Hamill\\, I'm sorry they ruined this Star Wars so irredeemably in your life time.","true":true}
