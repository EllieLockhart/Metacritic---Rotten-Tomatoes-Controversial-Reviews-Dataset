Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Taken by itself it is a good sci-fi movie. The plot and characters are somewhat engaging\\, and I enjoyed myself. Yes\\, as a movie it could be better\\, most of the jokes fell flat\\, many of them were pretty forced\\, there were definitely plot points that made the build up to it feel like a waste of time\\, but all in all\\, a good sci-fi movie.\\n\\nThis movie's failings really come to light when it is examined as a part of the larger Star Wars saga that has grown a multi-generational fan base. I certainly don't think it is the _worst_ Star Wars movie of them all (and I think after a few years and some perspective\\, many of the fans claiming that right now will agree). However\\, it does a major disservice to many of the characters that fans have grown to cherish; the film (or the people behind) seemed to have a personal animosity against the character Luke Skywalker. It is hard seeing the reasoning behind taking that character where they did. The actions and developments in many of the characters portrayed in this movie clash with what we've already learned about them from previous films. Even story lines that started in the previous film\\, The Force Awakens are undone with little continuation or development.\\n\\nHowever\\, with all of its faults\\, I still enjoyed watching it\\, I would recommend to anyone that they see it (just don't get your hopes up\\, and don't spend a lot of money). The film didn't come anywhere near as close to ruining the franchise for me as did the continued attacks on the fan base from critics and the SJW class. The film (and those behind it) can't be held entirely responsible for the way that others choose to use it to attack others; however\\, I have not seen an effort from the studio or filmmakers to try and distance themselves from it\\, and in some ways (as others have pointed out)\\, have leaned in and encouraged some of the abuse. If you want us to like new storylines and new characters\\, then make them interesting and engaging. Don't calls us bigots for offering genuine criticisms of your product. Just listen to the feedback and try and do better next time. I'll still be eagerly awaiting Episode IX when it comes out in 18 months.","true":true}
