Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi does everything you want from a middle part of a Star Wars trilogy.  Great action\\, amazing effects\\, stellar writing and performances\\, and twists and turns that will shake your expectations to the core.\\n\\nDon't go into this movie with a theory close to your heart.","true":true}
