Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Objectively\\, this movie was good but subjectively this movie\\, to me\\, was nothing but wasted potential. The main male characters barely have any character development and Finn gets sidelined. Some of the characters are horrifyingly out-of-character. Luke's character gets *destroyed* because the director has a boner for fascist redemption arcs and it was all for nothing in the end anyway. Luke's character got destroyed for That.\\n\\nThe OT makes me the happiest and so do the ending to each one of those movies. You know that something is wrong when you have angry tears streaming down your face when the credits roll on a Star Wars movie.","true":true}
