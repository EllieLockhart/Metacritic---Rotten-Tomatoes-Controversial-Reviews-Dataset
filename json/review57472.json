Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was terrible\\, for those of us that are Star Wars fans deserve a redo of this movie. The way Luke was portrayed was just a down right rip off. What in the world was Rian Johnson thinking about when he wrote this. I'd rather watch paint dry than this movie ever again. Good luck to JJ Abrams trying to fix this saga in episode 9.i guess the good thing is\\, it can't be worse than this one. I am extremely disappointed in this movie\\, it was tough giving it a 1 Star.","true":true}
