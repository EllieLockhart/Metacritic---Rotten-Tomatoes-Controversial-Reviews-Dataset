Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes well established characters and either underutilized or destroyed them. The characters introduced in the Sequel Trilogy receive next to no development or are reduced to comic relief. There are noteworthy inconsistencies within the story itself. It also performs stunts that fly in the face of established lore.","true":true}
