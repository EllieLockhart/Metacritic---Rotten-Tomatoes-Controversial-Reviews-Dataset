Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens punched you in the face and yelled\\, \\\"Remember what Star Wars is!\\\"  Yes\\, the movie was derivative\\, but that was by design. They needed to re-establish a proper tone after the awful prequels.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi punches you in the face and yells\\, \\\"Forget everything you think Star Wars should be\\, this is what Star Wars is now.\\\"  While it certainly fails to meet nearly every narrative expectation the fanboys wanted from it\\, Rian Johnson has delivered the most complete and well crafted Star Wars film since Empire.  Maybe even the best shot film in the entire franchise.  \\n\\nI think The Last Jedi will age superbly and Johnson\/Kennedy's vision for the future of the series will become more apparent and appreciated with repeat viewings. I can't wait for Johnson's original trilogy.  The galaxy far\\, far away is in good hands.","true":true}
