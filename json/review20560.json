Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ive never been more dissapointed in a movie. I tried really hard to like this movie. Even the day after seeing it I was trying to convince myself that I liked it\\, but I just can't shake how poorly they handled Luke's character. The \\\"B\\\" and \\\"C\\\" plots of this movie are a complete waste of time. There is completely out of place humor that lands flat\\, and what the hell was that scene with Leah \\\"force flying\\\" through outer space!?! I've lost faith in Disney's Star Wars universe. The fact that the executives thought this movie was good enough to justify giving Johnson an entire trilogy is mind boggling. JJ has his work cut out for him after the direction this story has been taken.","true":true}
