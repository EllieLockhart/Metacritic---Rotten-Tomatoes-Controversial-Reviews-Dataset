Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't normally participate in ratings and such\\, but this was such a disappointment that I had to create an account just to tell you to avoid this stinker. Lots of graphics\\, an incredible butchering of the plot as well as the Star Wars universe","true":true}
