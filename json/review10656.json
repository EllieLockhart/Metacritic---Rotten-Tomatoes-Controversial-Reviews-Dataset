Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had High expectations toward The Last Jedi\\, mostly because with all of the mistery boxes the previous director launched in the Force Awakens. This movie was highly controversial and  disappointing\\, not as a Star Wars fan myself\\, but as a film with a stellar cast and a competent writer\/director as Rian Johnson. Old characters are mostly downsized to push a newer\\, progressive generation\\, and im ok with the principle.\\, But the stepping on Egg Shells and the attempt to destroy what was established at the end of Episode 7 makes this movie a bloated\\, uninspired\\, frustrating mess. Sure the movie is well directed and technically impressive\\, but lacks the character depth or even some of those mistery\/hype boxes to send me for an episode 9 ticket purchase. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver are what pushed the movie for me\\, even with the adversity of their character arcs. Daisy Ridley is a very expressive actress but her character needs some serious writing work.   until then lets see what JJ can do with this shiny hot potato Rian has delivered. Be progressive\\, sure\\, but tell good stories and dont disrespect the fans Lucasfilm.  My 13 y o godson was highly hyped for this movie and after the first hour he just wanted to get out of the theater.","true":true}
