Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching the movie it went in more depth of the whole Jedi background\\, which I thought was cool. It shows that there is Darkness but there is always Light that combats it. The movie had a great story close to the Empire strikes back which people thought was too slow\\, unorganized\\, no additional plots\\, never get a back story of the emperor until the prequels\\, and what Darth Vader the most evil Sith was Lukes father!!!  Which people still hated. For me I went with an open mind and noticed that it makes sense where the characters stand. Warning spoiler!!\\nIt did not surprise me that Kyelo Ren did what he did\\, because he is unstable and is insecure which means he will do anything to prove himself\\, even killing his leader and his father Hon. :( I feel Rey was awesome and the fight sense were way better than the other light saber fights in prequels. My heart raised when I saw Kyelo give Rey the light saber to fight together\\, that rocked! I say go with an opened mind and you will see the movie is well put together.","true":true}
