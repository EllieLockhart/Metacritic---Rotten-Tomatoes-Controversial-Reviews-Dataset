Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible movie\\, at least\\, for causing such a divide in the sw fanbase. Usually\\, when a product is good\\, you don\u00b4t see so much people arguing about it. For example\\, how many have you see arguing Pizza is bad?. This is for those that give this 5 stars\\, don\u00b4t be blind and hypocrites. This is a product\\, we are the consumers\\, and there\u00b4s certainly something wrong with it","true":true}
