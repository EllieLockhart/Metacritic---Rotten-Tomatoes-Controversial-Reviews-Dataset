Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I hate the Jedi\\, because they re forced down our throats all the time\\, but Luke Skywalker deserved better than this Art house Fan Film we got for what was suppose to be an Episode\\,but it is actually Part II TO FORCE AWAKENS\\, ITS A CONTINUATION\\, NOT AN EPISODE.. even the First Order Deserved better\\, and we still have no idea who anyone is or what their purpose and function is for all we know\\, the Resistance\\, is truly the Villain.","true":true}
