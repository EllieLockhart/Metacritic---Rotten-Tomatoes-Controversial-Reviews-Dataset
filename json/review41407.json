Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie  is an insult to all the star wars fans worldwide\\, i can\u00b4t believe that Rian Johnson destroyed a wonderful saga beloved by many from kids to elder people\\, he did not do a serious script for the characters and the story\\, every scene is a joke\\, Hux was destroyed\\, Poe Dameron\\, Finn\\, and specially Rose ruined star wars. Compared with the empire strikes back or even the episode\\, this movie is disgusting\\, almost every character that i saw in the movie were some kind of clones of JAR JAR... damned Johnson and Disney\\, hope you burn in hell for doing this atrocity.","true":true}
