Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Made an account just to to say this... I honestly have no idea why these critics are rating so high. I'm honestly questioning if I watched the same movie that is being discussed in those dishonest kiss-a reviews. Everything about this movie that makes it my least favorite film in existence has already been said in the audience reviews. The writing was garbage with countless COUNTLESS plot holes. The movie totally craps on the family figure and male leadership by turning every male lead into some negative incapable waste. Our child hood hero who we know and love sits on an island drowning in his past mistakes and exits the franchise is the most dispicable unheroic wasteful manner that I am honestly disgusted. They should have known what they we're doing to the franchise when Mark Hammel tried to tell them. This movie throws away everything we know and love about starwars in such a disrespectful insensitively unceremonial way just to wipe the slate clean for Disney's crappy agenda crap and it has ruined the franchise. Great job Disney. I'm sorry Mr. Lucas I'm sorry you have to watch this happen.","true":true}
