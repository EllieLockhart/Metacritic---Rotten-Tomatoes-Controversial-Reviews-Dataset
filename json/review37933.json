Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These insane fans believe Luke's attitude departs from Jedi canon.  That is not true.  People tend to forget that Obi-Wan and Yoda gave up on training Jedi after Darth Vader turned\\, and Yoda lost to Palpatine.  Escaping the Skywalker family as the end-all Jedi? force is not a bad thing.  Sure\\, Anakin was conceived by Midichlorians\\, but that did not mean he was the only one.  It did not mean that he was uniquely more powerful than the Jedi who were conceived by two parents.  The elements of this episode in the Saga were very much like one of the Star Wars video games.  There is no reason to pan the episode the way \\\"die-hards\\\" have.  This was a well-made movie with good conflict and plot structure.  The characters are as well developed as any in the Star Wars movies.  Haters are gonna hate\\, but they have to understand that this was not a major departure in any way from canon.  The graphics were beautiful\\, and the new characters tugged at audiences' heartstrings.  The ending was inspiring and gave the feeling that there was a new hope yet again.  This deserves to be a 5-star movie.  If you are going to pan a movie\\, pan the Force Awakens.  That was significantly more reminiscent of the Episode 1 debacle.","true":true}
