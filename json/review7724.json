Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent cinematography... all while enhancing the science fiction feeling of the core of what Star Wars really is. Cant wait to see the continued growth of the new characters introduced! And to find out what is really dark and what is really light!","true":true}
