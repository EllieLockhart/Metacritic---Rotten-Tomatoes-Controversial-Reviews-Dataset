Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not sure what is causing all the negative reviews. I have seen all the movies\\, and I felt this one was a fine addition to the series. Great diverse cast of characters\\, and real heart in the potrayals.\\nLooking forward to the next installment.","true":true}
