Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think giving it a 1\/2 star rating is to harsh...listen to me.\\n\\nThis purely just doesn't feel like star wars. coming from someone who genuinely loves every minute from Episodes 1-6+Rogue One. I love Attack of the Clones and Phantom menace. but this...this had its magic moments\\, but for the most part it just didn't do any of these characters justice...at all! \\n\\nI love Kylo Ren\\, Rey\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, POE. BB-8. Leia\\, my sweet princess Leia. LUKE. god what you did with Luke was amazing. But smoke\\, Phasma\\, Hux? weakling. \\n\\nAlso\\, the jokes\\, please. the joke in the beginning? that just sounds like something that WOULD be said on planet earth. seriously. STOP with the jokes. and the Casino scene? Canto Bight felt like a cheap Guardians of the Galaxy world with their monsters. \\n\\nSo many side plots that just didn't really need to be. either. I have hope for JJ Abrams in Episode 9. I DO! But this...I dont know where my heart is in all this...\\n\\nHope those who watched it enjoyed it. I do.","true":true}
