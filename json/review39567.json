Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was\\, okay...\\, the film cared too much about little jokes than it did plot. it got boring from spending all the time on either the two planets. The scene where leia uses the force doesn't make sense either. Snoke died very easily and i feel like he didn't have any story line what so ever. The only good bits were the mirror under the island and the salt planet fight.","true":true}
