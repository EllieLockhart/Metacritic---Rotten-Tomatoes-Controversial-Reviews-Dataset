Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very disappointing. the battle in the beginning is well done and thrilling. \\nbut this good impression changes suddenly a little later. \\n\\nwhy is luke portrayed like this? why? this figure has influenced and inspired so many people. \\nnow he's just a poor weirdo on an island. and his death is just sad. ... and lame.\\n\\nThere are a lot of illogical moments in the film. so much stuff in there just doesn't make any\\nsense.","true":true}
