Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The most worrying thing is how did this get 92% from critics - did they see a different movie \\, were they bought off !!??? Hated it! The worst Star Wars film ever\\, the first one I didn\u2019t even enjoy. Yes\\, much much worse to my mind than Phantom Menace. Souless \\, humourless\\, way overlong \\, bad rehash of original movies themes . Very strange reviews- critics loved it but audiences are hammering it - including many long time star wars fans like me - who have been there since 1977- it was plain boring . Just feel badly let down. ","true":true}
