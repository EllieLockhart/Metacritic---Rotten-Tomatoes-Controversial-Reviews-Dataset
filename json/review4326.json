Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can understand why the movie is split between audiances  but I loved it\\, in certain aspects it does do worse than The Empire Strikes Back such as character devolpment regarding characters like Snoke but also does something's better such as the sense of how desprate the resistance is through out the entire movie","true":true}
