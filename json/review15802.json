Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and have grown up loving it but this movie disappoints in so many ways Disney has destroyed the bad guys how they ever became an empire is beyond me.\\nThe empire need to sack their designers so many floors in the ships it's a joke.\\nBring back the empire we all love.","true":true}
