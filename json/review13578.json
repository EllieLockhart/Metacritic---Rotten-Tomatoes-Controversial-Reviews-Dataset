Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I felt completely cheated after this movie.  No I am not a fanboy who only wants the original cast.  But at least give them a solid sendoff\\, they are what made Star Wars after all.  I don't think I have ever been this disappointed in a film.  Plot was choppy and lacked depth\\,  killed off big characters new and old with ease\\, too much Disney\/Marvel style jokes.  Visually it was great and the score was fantastic\\,  the only saving grace.","true":true}
