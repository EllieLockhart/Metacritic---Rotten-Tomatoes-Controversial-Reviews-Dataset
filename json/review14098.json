Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If your first star wars movie was The Force Awakens\\, you'll love this\\, but if you are a fan of the OT\\, you'll despise how they dumped all the mythos in the garbage.\\n\\nThanks Rian and Thanks Disney.","true":true}
