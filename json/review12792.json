Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did and didn't like this movie. The jokes were extremely cheese and ruined the seriousness of the Jedi legacy Some parts were boring and too much unnecessary details. The only reason I give the movie a 50% is because it had some pretty awesome parts and messages\\, great script\\, but again half of the movie is a waste of effects and time. Focus more on the jedi training not so much on the irrelevant side story.","true":true}
