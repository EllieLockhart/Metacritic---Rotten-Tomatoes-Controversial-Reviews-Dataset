Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was not good. The plot is a mess. The characters are all dumb as a bag of hammers. The only part that was good was when one of the main characters says\\, this all needs to die and come to an end.\\nI could not agree more.","true":true}
