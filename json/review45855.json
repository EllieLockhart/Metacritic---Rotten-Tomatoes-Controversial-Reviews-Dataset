Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very underrated sure The Movie had Flaws but after I saw this it became my new 2nd Favorite Star Wars Movie. This Film had many gripes from Fans like the way they portrayed Luke and stuff like that but I still love the movie. Can't wait till it comes out on Blu-Ray.","true":true}
