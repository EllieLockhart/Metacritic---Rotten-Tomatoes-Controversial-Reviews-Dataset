Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't have a problem with people disliking this film\\, I just thougt it is pretty good. It isn't the best movie ever made\\, but it's great. And yes\\, I know the casino subplot is quite silly and they didn't have to invent Holdo completely new just to have a woman sacrafice herself\\, but none of that destroyed the film for me. The Canto Bight scenes aren't great\\, but they're not worse than\\, for example\\, the scenes in Jabba's palace in ROTJ. It's just Star Wars\\, I thougt. Also\\, the score is\\, as it was expectable\\, very good\\, since it's John Williams. But what I thougt was fantastic\\, was that in a movie like Star Wars\\, an idea of a man in 1977\\, they brought us to a point\\, where the hero almost became the villain and the villain\\, well didn't become the hero\\, but he stated the \\\"goal\\\" of the movie quite crlearly. I mean\\, he said\\, let the past die.\\n\\nMy conclusion is\\, that you can hate the movie alright\\, carry on\\, but if you don't even give Rian Johnson's ideas a chance\\, you are missing something. This movie beautifully adds to Star Wars\\, which is also why a new trilogy should exist\\, to add to the ideas of a few people 40 years ago. Unless 'The Force Awakens' this movie isn't afraid of moving on. It just walks with the time and if you want to see your typical Star Wars\\, just watch IV\\, V\\, and VI\\, but don't hate the new ones for not copying their prequels","true":true}
