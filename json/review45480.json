Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed in the film. I think the story is getting old. I did not like the humor\\, character development\\, or the plot direction. It seemed out of place at times and unorganized. And the ending did not produce a feeling of excitement or anticipation of what is to come. Of all 6 major releases\\, this was by far the worst. While I did appreciate the spirit of the story I just could not bring myself to give it a strong rating. Luke's destiny was the strongest part of the story but not enough to save it. The better bring in some big guns to save the saga. Good luck!","true":true}
