Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible. It's like Disney didn't even read the script or watch the movie that Rian made\\, how in the heck did this ever get released?? Every question we had was not only answered poorly but the questions were thrown out the window. Luke Skywalker as a character was utterly crapped on. I can't believe it but it would have been a better movie even if it was revealed that Snoke was Jar Jar Binks and he went into a musical song and dance for the last 30 minutes\\, and Rey is jar jar's daughter.","true":true}
