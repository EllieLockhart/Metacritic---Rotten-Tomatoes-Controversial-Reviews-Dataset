Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"People told me about \\\"Leia Poppins\\\" so I was prepared for that.\\nBut they didn't tell there were TONS of stupid scenes in this movie!\\n\\n- How about when BB8 drives the Walker and saves the day for the 100th time?\\n\\n- How about Luke dying because... he was tired?\\n\\n- How about astral projection?\\n\\n- How about Poe's \\\"call on hold\\\" 'joke'?\\n\\n- How about bombs and people falling in the \\\"gravity\\\" of space?\\n\\n- How about the whole character of Rose Tico! Worse than JarJar Binks!\\n\\n- How about that cow thing with purple hair?\\n\\n- How about \\\"book burning\\\"! (Did Yoda and Luke turn into Nazis or Communists?)\\n\\n- How about Luke sucking green milk from gross alien nipples?! \\n\\n- How about Rey beating Luke in a stick fight?  \\n\\nI could go on but its too annoying to think about!","true":true}
