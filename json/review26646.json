{"101487":159021,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-17","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok.  First of all\\, it's amazing how the critics call everyone who gave a negative review here a \\\"bot\\\" while the people that gave 4-5 stars usually say something like \\\"amazing\\\" or \\\"i loved it' and that's it\\, while the negative comments usually write enough to fill a book.  So in my opinion\\, this is another reason why critics are pathetic.\\nNow... On to this disaster of a movie.\\nI don't want to rehash what everyone said (which is all true) but rather add a few things that weren't discussed (or at least I didn't see it).\\n1.  So it's 3 hours +- after the resistance blew up starkiller base.\\nPoe pretty much saved everyone.  Somehow the first order totally regroups and moves onto the offensive.  Poe and his team destroy a dreadnought with bombers who apparently only work outside of atmospheres. (Seriously\\, imagine dropping those bombs in TFA.  Would have worked pretty quickly).  Poe comes back and Leia is mad at him for doing it.  (Which I get).  \\nHowever\\, demoting him after he saved everyone a few hours before is a little harsh in my opinion.\\nFast forwarding here... first order tracks them through hyperspace.\\nSo\\, if Poe wouldn't have blown up the dreadnought\\, the dreadnought would have tracked them and blown them all up as it has a super gun.  Looks like Poe saved everyone again.  promoted?  Nah.   Purple hair scoffs at him.  (We'll get back to her).  Also\\, considering they blew up the hangar\\, all the bombers would have been lost anyway\\, so at least they went down blowing up the dreadnought and not in the hangar.\\n\\n2.  Purple hairs plan of sneaking onto the nearby planet while cloaked to the first orders trackers is totally based on the hope that some storm trooper in the john isn't looking out the window and suddenly sees 30 ships leaving the big ship.\\n\\n3.  Rose stops Finn from destroying the battering cannon.  Considering that saving the things you love wins wars\\, it would have sucked that if the falcon hadn't evacuated everybody they would have all been slaughtered in about 5 minutes.  But hey.. love will always triumph.  Thank god Churchill didn't use that approach in the 40s.\\n\\n4.  Benicio del Toro reveals the resistance plans to the first order.  When was he made aware of the plans? I recall\\, when Poe last talked to Finn he was still holding the control room and hadn't been aware of the plan.  So who told del Toro?  How did he know?  Maybe the writers know.\\n\\n5.  Finn in this movie.\\nWriters to Kathleen Kennedy:  What do we do with Finn?\\nKathleen Kennedy: Who's Finn?\\nWriters:  One of the main characters from TFA.\\nKathleen Kennedy: He's male.  Disgrace him and get rid of him.\\nWriters:  He's black.\\nKathleen Kennedy:  Oh.  In that case give him a big side plot.  Who's his pet peeve?\\nWriters: Captain Phasma.\\nKathleen Kennedy:  Good\\, have him kill Captain Phasma.\\nWriters: Captain Phasma is female.  You want the male character to kill a female in hand to hand combat?\\nKathleen Kennedy:  Have her kill Finn.\\nWriters:  You wanna have a white girl kill a black man?\\nKathleen Kennedy:  ok\\, I got nothing.  Give me ideas.\\nWriter:  I got it.  Phasma can kick Finns butt but Finn makes a miraculous WWE recovery and sucker punches Phasma and knocks her through a hole.  That way the woman kicked his ass but the male won by a technicality.  Everyone is happy.\\nKathleen Kennedy:  I love it.  Print it.\\n\\n6.  The resistance\\, which is the new republic of planets\\, has\\, even in TFA\\, about 40 x wings and some capital ships and maybe a few thousand troops.  Meaning that if the new republic decided to declare war on Micronesia\\,  the new republic would be seriously outnumbered.\\n\\n7.  Finn recovers from his back being sliced open in a number of hours and acts like nothing happened.  impressive.\\n\\nMy alternative ending.  This ending would fit in to the way this movie was made.\\nYoda force tells Leia while they are about to run out of gas that he put a surprise in their glove compartments.\\nThey look and all say together \\\"Liquid Schwartz!!!\\\".\\nThey gas up and go into uber hyperspace.\\nThe first order flagship tracker overheats from the attempts of tracking and blows up the ship.\\nSnoke\\, Kylo Ren\\, Rey\\, Finn and Rose all die.\\nThe resistance celebrates.\\nPoe realizes that Purple hairs military tactical knowledge matches that of a 3 year old playing battle ship.  Seeing her as a liability\\, he throws her into the trash compacter.  Everyone is happy.\\nThe ending is Chewy and Luke on Ach too having a bbq porg dinner. \\n\\nIf you think about it\\, Poe is the only reason that the resistance survived while everything that Leia and Purple hair tried to do would have gotten them destroyed.\\n\\nAnyway\\, I hated this movie.\\nI actually saw it a second time with my friend and a quarter of a way through the movie I started reading the news on my phone.\\nI put one star because I can't put minus stars.\\nThat's what I think of this movie.\\nR.I.P Star Wars.\\n\\nUpdate:  I recommend seeing the \\\"How it should have ended\\\" for this.\\nIt's better then the actual movie.  Sad.","true":true}
