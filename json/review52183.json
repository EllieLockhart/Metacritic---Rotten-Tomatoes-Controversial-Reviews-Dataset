Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After waiting for 2 years this movie was a massive letdown. Snoke\\, Luke\\, Rey\u2019s parents\\, Knights of Ren\\, General Hux\\, Benicio del Toro\u2019s characters. All didn\u2019t live up to the expectations and the buildup. What a joke","true":true}
