Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wasn't going to watch it\\, because the Force Awakens was so horrible. But somebody had me watch it for free. It was the most uncreative\\, shallow movie of all the Star Wars movies. I'll stop right here\\, because I don't want to waste my time talking about this movie.","true":true}
