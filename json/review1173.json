Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A part of me has died inside after watching this movie. No character development\\, lots of plot holes\\, no epic battles\\, no epic soundtrack\\, and\\, to top it all: Luke\\, the guy that didn't kill Vader despite all the evil he did\\, went on to almost killing a kid without any wrongdoings. Good job\\, Disney! RIP STar Wars.","true":true}
