Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019m not a big Star Wars fan but I loved 4-6. Hated 1-3. Loved Force Awakens and don\u2019t judge me but currently think Rogue One is one of the best films in the entire franchise. But WOW is this film absolute garbage. Two words: Canto Bight. The most disjointed and uninteresting plot line I think I\u2019ve ever seen in a film. I almost fell asleep. And the fact that there was no back story to Snoke\\, or Rey for that matter. Luke seems almost heartless in the film and all the build up in character development in Force Awakens gets thrown the window. And it\u2019s too late even if they attempt to answer questions in Episode 9\\, because I won\u2019t be watching it after this debacle. ","true":true}
