Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was very disappointing. It completely ruins all of the past roles of Luke Skywalker and turns him into someone he was not. In the previous movies we saw him face more difficulties than any other character and he never gave up. He even had to face his father in a true heartbreaking matchup and it never ruined Luke as a Jedi. And in this one\\, the producer demolished his Jedi image (reviewing without giving away any main plots). This movie also starts to be \\\"politically correct\\\"\\, and as a female\\, it is embarrassing that Disney had to try so hard to accomplish this. Ignoring other politics parts of the movie\\, the movie has many parts that are the opposite of the previous movies and turns Star Wars into a completely different kind of movie. All of the Bloodlines and the characters can be completely discarded because nothing matters anymore from the previous movies. This movie puts Star Wars to shame. The audience reviews are 50% and keeps decreasing\\, shows what a horrible job the producer did changing the true story of Star Wars.","true":true}
