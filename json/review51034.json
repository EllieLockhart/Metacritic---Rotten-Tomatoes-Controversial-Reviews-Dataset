Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely beautiful! Rian really did a wonderful work with this one. In TFA many people were complaining that it was a carbon copy of ANH and they wanted something new and original\\, now people are complaining that they don\u2019t want original stories\\, they want \u201cStar Wars\u201d. The character development in this film is absolutely amazing\\, the development of Kylo Ren has turned him into my favorite character of the Star Wars universe. Adam Driver is by far the best actor in the Star Wars universe. I would definitely suggest seeing it a second time\\, because you really get to see the film as it is and how great it is. The thing that\u2019s different about this film versus all these other films is that this one focuses on characters and not all on plot. This plot was rather wishy washy and not much there unlike most all of the other Star Wars films\\, but the character focus is unlike any other film we have seen. I believe it is truly amazing what Rian has done and there was so much symbolism in the film and I can\u2019t wait to see what he does in the future with the new trilogy. ","true":true}
