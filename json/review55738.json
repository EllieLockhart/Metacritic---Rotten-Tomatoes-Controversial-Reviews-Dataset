Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Out of all the Star Wars films that are made this one is directed by Rian Johnson. People absolutely adore it for it's everything\\, the acting\\, the effects and the writing like in The Force Awakens and they can't wait for another film to come out which is called Episode IX. So after Star Wars: The Force Awakens\\, people absolutely loved everything about it. Much like the original trilogy\\, they love all the memorable stuff in these. They love the music like I do\\, it's so memorable. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker\\, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as Han Solo. The side characters are alot of fun too but with those in the original trilogy\\, I'll get to that later in the original Star Wars reviews in the meantime. Now for this Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi or Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, whatever you wanna call it\\, is continued previously after Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Now I'm sure alot of you might be thinking: I've been watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi with my friends. Now this is not the first time I've been to the cinema with my friends. No\\, no\\, no\\, no\\, no. The first time I've been to the cinema with my friends is where we've been watching Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Yeah\\, bet you didn't you\\, did you? The film resembles around four new characters from Episode VII - The Force Awakens\\, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren\\, Daisy Ridley as Rey\\, John Boyega as Finn and Oscar Issac as Poe Dameron. Geez\\, they have new actors and actresses put into this which is why they're from The Force Awakens. And I think the film has new characters in this by Laura Dern and Benicio de Toro. Yeah\\, maybe that's all I can about The Last Jedi and also before I end it\\, I just gotta say\\, the visuals in the end battle are gorgeous. Whoever did the red crystals makes the visuals of the crystals and the floor made of red crystals really makes it so beautiful and fantastic to look at. So yeah\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a fantastic film and I sure gotta get around to watching the other Star Wars films. Even though I did notice before leaving the cinema is a tribute to Carrie Fisher who died last year of a heart attack after my favourite singer George Michael on Christmas Day. So that is Star Wars: the Last Jedi and people and I can't wait for the last and final film of the Star Wars films in 2019. Stay Tuned. May the force be with you.","true":true}
