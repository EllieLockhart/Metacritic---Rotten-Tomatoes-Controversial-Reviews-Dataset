Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely loved The Last Jedi. The story progressed beyond nostalgia for the original trilogy and really challenged the characters in ways I didn't see coming. It's hard not to think a lot of these low star reviews are shady\\, most of them have never reviewed another movie on this site and they spew out vague complaints that clearly don't hold any weight or sense of reality. It's also hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it\\, so what I'll keep my thoughts to the point. I loved the surprises\\, the action set pieces\\, the acting (especially Adam Driver and Mark Hamill)\\, and the visuals. The humor was lighter than Force Awakens and there were a handful of plot threads that were a little slow for me. But man oh man\\, the last 45 minutes is peak Star Wars and I loved it so much!","true":true}
