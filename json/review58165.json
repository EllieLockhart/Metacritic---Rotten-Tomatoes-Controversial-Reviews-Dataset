Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Written off in the original trilogy as an acting lightweight\\, Mark Hamill's performance in Last Jedi should silence critics. But the real stars of this movie are the writing and cinematography. Surprisingly laugh-out-loud funny\\, Last Jedi still takes itself too seriously\\, but this universe doesn't seem so \\\"far\\, far away\\,\\\" and that's a good thing. On the other hand\\, the camera work and CGI are truly out of this world. The grey turbulence that swirls around Luke Skywalker's island hideout is as darkly beautiful as the post-apocalyptic world in the last Blade Runner film. The final battle scene on a salt planet-reminiscent of the ice planet battle in Empire Strikes Back-paints the screen in broad red and white brush strokes that imply the ghastly costs of war without bathing in gore. Like Empire\\, this sequel truly improves on its predecessor\\, perhaps standing as the strongest of the franchise's many installments.","true":true}
