We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Where to start. I guess to give my opinion on the whole \\\"killing characters\\\" controversy. Having Joel die is fine\\, honestly. The writers clearly wanted to have that as the main driving point of the story and for the spotlight to be on Ellie rather than Joel.\r\rThe story-telling as a whole was poorly structured. I liked the flashbacks of moments that have relevance in character development. Although I feel like there should have been more mystery. Maybe not open with the previous game's main character dying. Like I said\\, it's fine he did\\, but maybe give the players a moment to get back into the game\\, the story\\, the franchise and reconnect with the characters. That way\\, the death would have made much more impact on the audience.\r\rOkay. Onto the worst part - Abby. Just... why? Why the **** do we play as the main antagonist? Half the game was spent playing as her and I hated every single moment of it. Remove her parts\\, and you've got a pretty good (but still not great) game.\r\rKeeping on the Abby subject but also going back to the story's structure\\, if you want us to care about a newly introduced character\\, maybe develop their character BEFORE you show their bad side? It's clear they wanted us to care about her otherwise we wouldn't have seen so much of her personal relationships\\, such as that with Owen.\r\rIf anything\\, they should have made us play Abby's parts either before Ellie's parts\\, or play each character day by day. Playing as Abby and having radio calls about an event you later play through as Ellie would have been really interesting. Also\\, don't leave us on a ****ing cliffhanger with Abby finding Ellie\\, Dina\\, Tommy and Jesse at the theater to then play the second half of the game. When that happened I was so ****ing frustrated and just wanted to know what happens. If they brought both character's story-lines to that point simultaneously - that would've been great. I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of players stopped playing when it got to Abby's half of the game. The only thing driving me through her parts was wanting to know what happens\\, I didn't give a **** what was actually happening DURING Abby's parts.\r\rThe gameplay overall was fine. It kept to the tried and true gameplay of the first game. I appreciated the fact they didn't try to change the formula to something completely unrecognisable from the first game.\r\rThe graphics and environments were incredible.\r\rOverall\\, fine game. Enjoyable for half of it\\, emotional ending (though not as emotional as the ending of the first). I feel like they could have done a much better job with the story they had if they just structured it a bit better.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
