Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a socially liberal person. I saw Star Wars seven times in my youth. With The Last Jedi\\, Disney has lost me. \\n\\nI don't go to Star Wars movies for political indoctrination. I go to be entertained by fun\\, gritty stories of good and evil played out on a galactic stage. Seeing powerful\\, complex characters reduced to simpering charicatures is not fun.\\n\\nThe progressive ideology is pervasive throughout the film and is frankly oppressive. It is unnecessary - progressives don't need Star Wars movies to advance their cause. And it is a betrayal to the film's brilliant and apolitical craftsmanship.\\n\\nIt will take an awful lot of convincing before I pay to see another Star Wars movie.","true":true}
