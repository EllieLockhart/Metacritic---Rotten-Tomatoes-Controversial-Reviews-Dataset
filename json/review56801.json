Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The path to redemption\\, the journey of conflict\\, and the unfortunate misunderstandings\\, all make some of the best most emotional scenes of this movie. I am of course talking about the dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren; Ryan Johnson did a solid one here. \\nIt didn't feel like a rehash of the empire strikes back\\, but it's still undeniably Star Wars. \\nAll the other scenes and minor plot lines were just as entertaining and inciting as the rest of the 'main' storyline. \\nThat being said\\, this movie did lack a little bit in terms of CGI; all of the new creatures looked incredibly fake\\, where as I believe that the Force Awakens did a much better job on that part. Every moment that Snoke was onscreen he felt anything but real to me\\, and Yoda\\, despite being a puppet (probably) still had CGI effects added on him that made him look... smoother than intended I guess? It took me out of the story a little bit when I saw majority of these cool new creatures and immediately I'm thinking\\, \\\"Come on\\, that looks so fake...\\\" \\nOtherwise it was a fantastic movie that I enjoyed the hell out of\\, and I can't wait to see what the bring us in the future.","true":true}
