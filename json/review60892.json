However\\, these qualities don't outshine the bads of this game\\, since The Last of Us is focused on the story and the characters. The story doesn't progress in a natural way\\, the manipulation of the events by the writer is blatantly obvious. In that sense\\, the characters are often forced to do things that are out of character or simply incoherent just so the story can be driven to the writer's desired direction. Aside from Ellie\\, Joel and Tommy\\, the characters weren't duly explored\\, which made me think \\\"if they die now\\, I don't care\\\" a lot. The message about revenge was also poorly conveyed\\, mainly because\\, once again\\, the story feels very artificial. Another bad aspect is the length. 20+ hours is too much for a first play in a game like this. It's unnecessarily dragged where it doesn't need to be. All in all\\, I wouldn't recommend.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
