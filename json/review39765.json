Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a movie for all public (hardcore fans\\, average fans and non fans) it has some filler content but it's necessary.\\nIt's fully charged of fellings and nostalgia. If you don't see the movie don't hear the reviews and critics\\, specially from that bad Fandom know by their criticism and their complaints of everything.","true":true}
