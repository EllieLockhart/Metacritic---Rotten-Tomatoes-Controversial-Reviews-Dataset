Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Oh man\\, what a terrible Star Wars movie. I waited and waited to see it after everyone kept telling me not to waste my time and when I finally saw it\\, I realized I should have watched the prequels instead. I liked the special effects and Luke's Jedi beard. I hated everything else. I am actually surprised the audience score is this high (about 50%) because I don't know anyone who likes this movie.","true":true}
