Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hated it. So much potential wasted. \\n\\nThis movie is filled with awful jokes\\, prequel levels of bad dialogue\\, and flat-out disappointing twists.\\n\\nThe plot focuses around an over abundance of conveniences\\, everything just happens when it needs to and characters do very little outside of dump exposition at each other. The CGI\\, most notably on Snoke\\, is quite bland\\, and there are plenty of scenes that had me cringing and sighing while the rest of the audience laughed and cheered.\\n\\nThe Porgs are really damn annoying\\, and appear in seemingly every shot on the island where Luke Skywalker resides. You can hear them sqwarking all the time\\, making fairly nice looking shots and themes look silly. The way they are shoehorned into this movie so clearly for the purpose of children's merchandise its pretty saddening. They aren't cute\\, and unlike the Gungans or Ewoks\\, they don't even do anything of value. I don't even like the Gungans or Ewoks.\\n\\nThis film clearly tries something new and original\\, but I think the prequels had already proved people don't like that. I believe Rian Johnson is a bad writer\\, and a worse director\\, I haven't enjoyed a single film he's directed\\, and I seriously can't imagine what Disney saw in him when finding people to helm a movie like this.\\n\\nI legitimately can't even believe how disappointed I am in this movie. I've had so much faith in the new trilogy\\, The Force Awakens was flawed but good. This? Disney just doesn't know what to do. They aren't developing the characters\\, and the story keeps going backwards in places.\\n\\nThe biggest reveal of the movie is pathetic and unsatisfactory.","true":true}
