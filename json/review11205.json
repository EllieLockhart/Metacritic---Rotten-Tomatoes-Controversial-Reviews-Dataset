Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"honestly i dont get why people are so angry at this movie. sure the plot is kinda thin but so much happened in this movie like we got to know who rey's parents were(even tho they were nobodys) \\, and ren became the new emperor by killing snoke\\, luke died\\, rey learned how to use the force and etc. Also the cgi & score was outstanding overall just a great movie","true":true}
