Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First time I ever came out of a Star Wars movie thinking I never want to see that again. Seemed to largely ignore the E7 plot\\, long periods of the movie seemed utterly pointless and indulgent. Not sure what the critics saw in it\\, but the fans have certainly spoken. An abomination. They have a massive repair job to do\\, a lot of damage has been done.","true":true}
