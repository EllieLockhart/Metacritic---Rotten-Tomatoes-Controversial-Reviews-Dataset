Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"These new Star Wars movies are great films and very enjoyable\\, but something is just missing - keeping them from being true STAR WARS movies and I can't put my finger on it.\\n\\nDefinitely worth a watch. This one did rehash some Empire Strikes Back moments\\, but is not nearly the cut and paste script that The Force Awakens was of A New Hope.","true":true}
