Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There's a scene at the beginning that serves perfectly as a metaphor for how Lucasfilm sees its fans: old\\, unwanted\\, and could they please go away? This is a film that finally brings back Luke Skywalker only to trample all over his character in the cynical\\, ironic fashion beloved of the entertainment industry. It gives a fat middle finger to any fans curious about questions raised by TFA\\, and literally destroys the lore so that MaRey Sue can continue to effortlessly become the savior of the Jedi. Add in a literal purple-haired feminist hectoring a heroic\\, swashbuckling man for his heroic swashbuckling\\, and you've got a Star Wars movie that hates everything about Star Wars.","true":true}
