Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They managed to ruin the possible plot twist for the important characters. Instead they made them insignificant and weak. Kylo Ren is not worthy of being a main villain\\, Luke's character is ruined beyond repair\\, Rey is a nobody with the ability of a Jedi master\\, Poe and Finn are useless and Leia is a flying princess..I mean c'mon they managed to ruin the star wars mythology and our beloved characters with a single movie. To quote Han Solo \\\"That is not how the force works\\\". Also the main plot of the movie was meh and full of plot holes. As a huge starwars fan who watched all of the movies multiple times and played every starwars game I find this movie to be a complete rape to the starwars saga.","true":true}
