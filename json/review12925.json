Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I did write an entire review but ended up losing it due to RT's awesome interface. Instead of re-writing\\, there are plenty of other 1\/2 star reviews where everyone is voicing the same problems with the movie that I had. In short\\, the movie sucked. Regardless of wanting to try something new or not\\, they flopped hard. Will not be seeing another Star Wars movie produced by Disney in theaters ever again\\, unless they decide to let the First Order wipe out every single resistance member and take over the galaxy. That would be the only saving grace for this dumpster fire of a trilogy.","true":true}
