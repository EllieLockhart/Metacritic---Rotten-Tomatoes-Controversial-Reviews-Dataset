Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought that this movie was amazing\\, it delved deeper into the force than before\\, we got more character development from the \\\"new\\\" main characters\\, we get to say goodbye to some\\, we see a new side to the saga.  This movie gives new life to series in a way that no other movie before has done.  It gives HOPE.  The script is well done\\, the action sequences are on point\\, and the fight choreography is masterfully done.  All over a great move\\, probably the best of the franchise so far.","true":true}
