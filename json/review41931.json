Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie just decided to crap all over everything that JJ has done for STAR wars. For that reason alone not even getting into the myriad of terrible plot holes and the fact that the whole movie is basically a slow car chase in space. TLJ falls short of being a good star wars movie.","true":true}
