Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely terrible. SPOILERS. The story is at odds with everything in the original trilogy: Luke\\, the previous savior of the galaxy and person who still saw good in Vader and refused to kill him now decides to hide on an island while everything he fought for falls apart and contemplates killing kids in their sleep; Leia can now defy physics and fly through space with no space suit.. not kidding; ships can now just use light speed and crash into Death Star type vessels to destroy them; Force users can now create holograms of themselves across the galaxy that and interact with the environment (why didn't Yoda just project himself from Deghoba and fight the empire?); and the list sadly goes on. This film is not truly Star Wars\\, and is an embarrassment to the franchise. Far worse than the Phantom Menace.","true":true}
