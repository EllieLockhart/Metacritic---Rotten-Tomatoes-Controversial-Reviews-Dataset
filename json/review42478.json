Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was a jumbled mess that stamped out the last vestiges of my childhood happiness.  Wrought with a SJW ideologically driven agenda\\, this film tries so desperately to \\\"not offend\\\" and \\\"appeal to the masses\\\"\\, that they end up sacrificing any semblance of plot development\\, character arcs and developing the brand.  As a lifelong\\, die hard Star Wars fan I wouldn't recommend this trash to even the casual consumer.  I won't be seeing another Star Wars film until Disney abandons the brand.","true":true}
