{"101487":155387,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-10-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My goodness where does this site get its reviewers? 91% on the \\\"Tomatometer\\\"?? Seriously? This film should be an outright 0. It was straight up garbage and the level of fan outrage out there is both justified and another clear indication of what critics are worth these days. The plot here is dumb. What more can I say? They missed the soul of Luke's character by so much\\, not even a phenomenal actor like Mark Hamil could act like what he was made to put on film for this was any good. Watch him in his interviews\\, it's hilarious- like he was warning us about this movie the whole time before it came out. Nothing about this movie made sense. Seriously\\, not 1 thing. Did they imagine this as a stand alone movie and that people watching it had not seen any of the previous films before? What was the pitch meeting for this film even like? I wish I could detail exactly how and why this movie is awful here without spoiling it\\, but I can't. If I had to really sum it all up\\, it felt like watching a franchise\\, one that has a whole universe of possibility for good story telling built on top of a solid foundation of already established stories\\, take a whole bunch of drugs and alcohol\\, grab a motorcycle\\, a kiddy pool\\, and a shark\\, and jump that baby right into a ravine filled with the razor sharp shards of every broken and discarded Suicide Squad dvd\/blu ray. I'm glad SOLO flopped afterwards and that Disney is FINALLY losing money. They have an army of very fine actors. But there isn't an actor alive (not even Mark Hamil\\, Harrison Ford\\, or Patrick Stewart who isn't even in the franchise) that can make up for either horrendous story telling or simply a complete lack of it. Honestly this was so bad\\, I don't know how they could ever salvage Star Wars in episode 9. And as a heartbroken fan of the series\\, I'm sincerely dreading what's about to be shoveled down my throat in December 2019. But hey\\, don't take my word for it\\, I'm not a paid critic :'D","true":true}
