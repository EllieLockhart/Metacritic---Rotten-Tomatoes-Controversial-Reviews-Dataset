Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disgrace\\, this movie is a continuous slap in the face to fans from beginning to end\\, my disapointment is immesurable and star wars is ruined. From the absolute molestation of the once great character of luke skywalker\\, (character assassination doesnt even do what they did to him justice). Rey has no real or clear motivations other than \\\"its the right thing to do\\\" which is a weak motivation if youre being kind. Ive been a fan of star wars since i was a boy\\, and for the first time in my life\\, i skipped a star wars movie because of this \\\"film\\\" and have no interest to see any more. Rian johnson should be ashamed of what he has done in this film. For no reason despite suffering a crushing defeat at the end of the force awakens\\, the first order has the resistance on the run. WHY?! They were kicking their ass an hour ago. This movie throws everything set up by the last film under the bus\\, then backed over it 16 more times. This film retroactivly made the force awakens awful too. This film is almost impressively bad.","true":true}
