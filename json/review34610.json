Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The CG and choreography are well done. The script is laughably bad. The movie was also more interested in virtue signalling than telling a story\\, and the film lacked any respect or interest in the previous films and characters. I won't be seeing any more star war films by Rian Johnson.","true":true}
