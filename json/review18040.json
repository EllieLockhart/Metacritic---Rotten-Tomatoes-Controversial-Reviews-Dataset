Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this is easily the best film in the franchise since the first movie. Archetypal story telling\\,  more serious themes\\, letting the old guard die to allow a new youthful guard to take over. Great movie. Loved it!!!","true":true}
