Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie I\u2019ve ever watched. Horrible battle scenes\\, except for Rey and Kylo in the throne room. Please the whole fleet gets blown up\\, half the transports\\, then only enough of the resistance survives that they fit in the falcon really? The bombers were such trash\\, use Y wings not sitting ducks... no actual Luke and leia reunion\\, then Luke never actually fights. Such a terrible\\, terrible movie. ","true":true}
