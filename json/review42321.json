Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie takes me back to how I felt when Empire Strikes Back came out.  The Last Jedi challenged me as a viewer to understand what was unfolding and why\\, while providing great familiar characters and situations (parallels like  Hoth on Krayt\\, Cloud City to the Casino and even the tree on Dagobah).\\nMark Hamil was amazing\\, I remember why I love Luke so much.  Carrie Fisher had a great place in the movie.  I am enjoying Kylo Ren and Ray a lot.","true":true}
