Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think this might be the worst Star Wars film yet and that's saying a lot. I watched it when it was released on bluray. I hated it. I hate how they do not respect anything from Star War history. I hate the obviously flawed fight sequences. I could go on but it's a terrible Star Wars movie. At best it is a mediocre space action flick but considering the bad fight sequences even that might be pushing it. ","true":true}
