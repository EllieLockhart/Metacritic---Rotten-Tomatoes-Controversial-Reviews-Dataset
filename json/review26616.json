Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay...I\u2019ve seen it twice. It\u2019s an entertaining movie in some parts and dull in others. Some real stupid things happened. Does it have some plot issues? Yes. Does it have some character issues? Yes. Its a little long and there is a couple of letdowns. It\u2019s not as good as ANH\\, ESB or TFA\\, but better than the prequels. ","true":true}
