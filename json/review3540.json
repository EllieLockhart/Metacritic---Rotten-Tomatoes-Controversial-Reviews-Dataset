Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER. Huge epic story arc for Luke Skywalker. Unbelievable character development for Rey and Kylo Ren(who is the most interesting villain in the history of star wars). Epic Light saber battle-check. Visually gorgeous battle scenes.. check. Heroic moments for the other characters-check. It has humor\\, tears\\, excitement-everything. I've seen it twice already and cant wait to go back. Don't believe the minority who are manipulating the audience score.This movie is wonderful.","true":true}
