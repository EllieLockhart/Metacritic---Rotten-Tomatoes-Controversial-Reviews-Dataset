Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In twenty years after the salacious crumb movie people will finally come around to see what this movie truly is\\, the best of the lot.  Not perfect\\, but a thoughtful film by a master filmmaker","true":true}
