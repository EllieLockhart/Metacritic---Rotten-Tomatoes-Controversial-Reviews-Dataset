Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is only my opinion and it can not hurt you so if you don't like how I feel that's OK only I have to feel this way not you.  The last Jedi was at face value beautiful. I was so excited about seeing the characters I had grown up with brought back to the big screen. I generally enjoyed the film and did not walk out thinking it sucked or anything like that\\, I laughed when you laughed and cheered when you cheered.  I FELT a bit ripped off with the way they treated my favorite character.  I know there is a whole feminism debate or something like that going on but I don't see that point of view\\, rather just a bunch of characters that are very forgettable being shoved in my face at the expense of the true heroes. This whole film gave me no reason to care for the characters which at times had me routing for the empire lol. All the political messages a side this movie was just one big wasted opportunity to tell a great starwars story.","true":true}
