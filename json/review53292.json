Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely shocked at how bad this was. It's easily the worst Star Wars movie and just a terrible movie\\, period. They pretty much disregarded everything Abrams and his team worked to build with the first movie and threw it away to do essentially nothing. The part in the beginning where Rey hands over the light saber to Luke and he tosses it over his shoulder like it is trash is the perfect analogy to what Johnson did with Abrams' work and the Force Awakens. I feel bad for Abrams\\, and I wasn't a fan of TFW. He's too classy to tell Disney to p*ss off\\, but he should.","true":true}
