Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a bad film. For the first 15 minutes or so you'll think I'm crazy. It feels just like a good star wars film. It feels like its on par with The Force Awakens. Then theres a cheesy face swap edit that happens and you try to ignore it because its been good so far and you want to love it. And then you reach a point of no return. Not because its a bad edit\\, or because it was wonky visually. No\\, its a point of no return because at that moment you realize that Rian Johnson\/Disney has a very different idea of what makes a good film. To them\\, good is extremely cheesy\\, without subtlety\\, and prequel trilogy esque. \\n\\nThe movie certainly tries to infuse new visual styles and some interesting concepts that would have sounded neat on a napkin. In reality the execution is terrible. We get awful edits and awkward dialogue\\, scenes reminiscent of bad anime fused with the prequels\\, tons of green screen\\, misuse of almost every character etc. The movie not only feels laughably bad or cheeseball frequently\\, but it also presents you with scene after scene of fluff. Many major plots end up being red herrings to a point where you have to ask why they even bothered writing these scenes. Defenders of the film claim its about failure and letting go\\, but in order for that to work\\, those failures need to feel important. In this movie\\, the failures have almost no impact on all of the main characters. The consequences for bad actions seem to be treated with cartoon level writing.\\n\\nI'm not a stickler for star wars canon. I don't care about cameos or seeing the same aliens again. I'm not really hard to please in this regard\\, and really one of my favourite movies in this universe\\, Rogue One\\, tried new things. In fact I want star wars to try new things. The fact is this movie is a mess. Not just a mess\\, but one in poor taste. I haven't really even begun to tell you why this movie is bad. If we watched it in real time i'd have to pause every few minutes to give you my 2 cents on why this scene was terribly directed or edited or full of enough cheese to turn you lactose intolerant.\\n\\nOnly watch this movie if you want to give yourself an aneurysm.","true":true}
