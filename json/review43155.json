Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This ruined all aspects of lore\\, character build-up\\, and potential for furthering this series. I am truly disgusted at the ability to ruin one of the best franchises in the world. Great job Rian whatever. You left me disgusted at the nearly $50 spent to see this with 4 other people basically ruined\\, by lack of continuity and ability to evolve for the better. I will not be supporting the 9th movie and i am disappointed that this heap of garbage is considered canon material.","true":true}
