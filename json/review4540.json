Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Cinematically this was an exciting movie.  If you do not really know or care about the Star Wars story line and characters\\, you will probably like it.  However\\, as a huge Star Wars fan\\, I hate what Rian Johnson did.  Star Wars is the story of the Skywalkers.  Episode 1-6 is the story of the rise\\, fall\\, & redemption of Anakin Skywalker.  The follow one trilogy should continue the Skywalker story.  Instead we have emo characters\\, idiot characters (ie\\, purple hair lady who sits and watches the entire fleet get destroyed before she decides to do anything; Finn and the girl who go on some weird trip where they act like idiots and end up making things far worse\\, and the hero of the Star Wars story refusing to help his sister and friends).  There was no good reason for Luke to die at the end other than Disney insisting that the story is not longer about the Skywalkers.  I am so very disappointed with this movie. \\nMy hope is that someone buys the rights from Disney and just starts over.  Who ever that person might be\\, \\\"help us\\, you're our only hope.\\\"","true":true}
