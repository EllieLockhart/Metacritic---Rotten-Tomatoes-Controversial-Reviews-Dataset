Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't hate it\\, but\\, I think this new direction just isn't my cup of tea. I felt disjointed\\, there were decent parts\\, only to be brought down by some truly eye rolling moments.. Sometimes\\, the humor landed just right\\, other times\\, I cringed and said \\\"seriously?\\\" To myself. There's a time and a place for everything\\, but sometimes it was just wrong. Some silly unnecessary moments. Star Wars has always had some humor but it was metered appropriately. I got sad when the guy got up next to me and was gone for 15 minutes. The kid next to me stopped paying attention halfway through the film. There were no cheers\\, no claps. Lots of sighs\\, tongue clicking\\, and some head shaking going on around me. Like George Lucas said \\\"It was beautifully made\\\" I think that was a well thought out response. The visuals were incredible. They story\\, the holes\\, the disappointments\\, it was up and down.  I left the theater in a \\\"meh\\\" state. I guess maybe I'm the old guard and these movies are being made for a new generation of movie goer and their wallet. This movie didn't ruin my childhood however. I have the originals to watch over and over again. Those are Star Wars movies of my generation. When Disney bought the franchise\\, I kind of guessed what would end up happening\\, and it looks like it's headed in that direction. I'm happy some people love this film\\, that's awesome for you. Me\\, I'm all set with this new vision now. I liked TFA and Rogue One even more. But that's me\\, to each their own. I'll rewatch it again once it's released on Cable or streaming. I'm not interested in paying the money to go back to the theater for this one. I guess everyone should go see it at least once to see what camp you fall in.","true":true}
