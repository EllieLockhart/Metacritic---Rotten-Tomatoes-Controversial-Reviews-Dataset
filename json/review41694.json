Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is not an star wars movie. The director wanted to make something new and revolutionary\\, but the lack  talent to get there will make this movie just something i want to forget.","true":true}
