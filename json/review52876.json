Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ambitious and entertaining. It wasn't everything I wanted\\, and at first because it was structured so differently than past films\\, I didn't connect with the film. The second half grabbed my attention however and the changes grew on me. In a world where lasers never hit their mark and plot holes abound in exchange for theatrical impact\\, I found the film's themes hit me hard and stuck with me long after the screening ended. Is there controversy? Yes - this is a new Star Wars\\, and even with its faults\\, it's worth seeing for its strengths and fresh perspective\\, maybe even worth seeing twice.","true":true}
