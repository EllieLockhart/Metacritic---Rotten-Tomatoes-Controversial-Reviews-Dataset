Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was by far the biggest disappointment in the Star Wars franchise. I watched it a couple times\\, and couldn't find anything I liked about this film. All the director seemed interested in was undoing everything from the previous movie. The story didn't progress at all. Instead\\, it's just sitting stagnant. The entire casino scene was idiotic\\, and was pointless in this type of movie\\, unless he was mistakenly thinking he was directing an Oceans 11 movie. He made introducing Snoke a complete waste of time\\, and the character was killed off to never be explained. Kylo magically gains Sith Lord powers he could never use out of thin air\\, just by killing Snoke. Rey is acquiring Jedi master powers with no training. Luke's training was garbage and his self I pity is so out of character from the young Luke. It's also impressive that Leia learned force powers she never had\\, even to the point she can survive in outer space without dying in seconds. There can be exaggerations for movie purposes\\, but don't make them so blindingly ridiculous\\, such as defying the common sense impossibility of being unprotected in open space. Also\\, in my opinion\\, the main cast was increasingly more whiny and self loathing to to point I wondered why they were cast in the first place. Also Poe Dameron went from an amazing pilot and rebel fighter\\, to being made out to be a completely incompetent moron\\, whose only ability is getting his friends killed with horrible ideas.  I swear if they kill off Chewbacca I will quit Star Wars for good. Most importantly\\, never let Rian Johnson near another movie of any kind again. He needs to seriously consider a career change!","true":true}
