Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"hands down the worst start wars movie ever.  Disney has killed the franchise and destroyed THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY.  In a nutshell this is nothing more than a rehashed version of empire strikes back... except you see all of the rebel fleet being chased and the imperial walkers in third act.  you would think with Disney's unlimited resources they could come up with a better plot. to make matters worse the film is all over the place\\, filled with childish jokes and massive plot holes.  no character development with new characters who randomly die!  please if your eager to see this movie wait for DVD\/blu ray at redbox....\\n\\non a final note \\\"the phantom menace!\\\" was a superior movie.  atleast the prequels had a beginning\\, middle and end with an over all story arc.  after watching TFA and TLJ I don't get the over all story arc.  The movie feels to me like a generic space Netflix movie...","true":true}
