From finding my first warp Zone in SMB to using the Flute to find level 7 in Zelda (1986) there are certain moments that take you away and into the game world.

Lovingly crafted and a tribute to gamers.\r\rWe live in Polarizing times\\, it's precient ND crafted a game that allows gamers to explore an alternatives side to an event or set of information.  It's not for everyone and I found the Ellie Portion much more satisfying\\, though I love that we are getting this level of story immersion in a game.\r\rHad we played Abby for more time before the Golf Club incident I think we would have been able to identify with her more.  Use the flashbacks to let us play and identify with Abby before we hate her guts for destroying our beloved Character.  It was a mistake to make Abby masculine in physical appearance\\, particularly with little to no explanation for why her physique was so unique in the game world.  This design choice raised an already high bar for me to climb in order to identify with Abby's world and motivations.\r\rLean into the game\\, you will be rewarded.\r\rBeyond minor gripes\\, the game was incredible.  The gameplay was incredible.  The hint system was incredible.  The game stays with you after you play it\\, and draws you back in.  Thank you Naughty Dog\\, I hope you guys lean into the challenge of effective story telling with your games.  By far the most talented AAA studio on the planet right now.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
