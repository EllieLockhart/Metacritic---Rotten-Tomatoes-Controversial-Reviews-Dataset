Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a let down\\, and how do you come up with 90% with an average rating of 8.1 out of 10\\, that's some serious rounding. Audience score of 48%. It had a few good parts\\, the time on the island\\, 10\\, any time on enemy ships\\, 10\\, time in the casino\\, 9\\, the rest of it\\, seemed like it was created in a conference room by marketers\\, serious let down.","true":true}
