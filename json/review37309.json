Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot is awful\\, 90% of the characters are unlikable and bland\\, the Movie takes place immediately after the last film yet the resistance is in way worse shape how\\, they don't explain anything like how the First Order even originated it makes no sense\\, and I can only assume Disney ran a algorithm and determined this plot would get the most money. \\n\\nDespite all this I enjoyed Reys character who I feel embodies the spirit of star wars\\, and it a great character however the rest is awful derivative cash grab","true":true}
