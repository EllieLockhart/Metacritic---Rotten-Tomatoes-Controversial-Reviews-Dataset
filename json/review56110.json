Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So so so disappointing. I left the theater feeling nothing. The SINGLE most iconic film character in my life died in front of my eyes\\, and I felt nothing. This film was shallow\\, weakly constructed\\, overlong\\, not nearly as funny as the writers\/director thought it was\\, and a massive let down. As a Star Wars lover for the past 37 years\\, it was appalling. The way they handled Luke's character was terrible. I could go on and on about my feelings and the intricacies of why I disliked it\\, but others have already done so to great lengths.\\n\\nI gave it two stars because it was beautifully filmed\\, and the sound was wonderful. Past that\\, there were a few glimpses I enjoyed\\, but they were so outweighed by the nagatives.","true":true}
