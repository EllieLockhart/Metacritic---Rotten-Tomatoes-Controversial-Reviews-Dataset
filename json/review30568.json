Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Signed up for RottenTomatoes just to write this review.  Was excited to see the follow on to The Force Awakens to see the development on the stories of Rey\\, Snoke\\, Fin\\, Phasma\\, and even Luke BUT instead I get stories on Rose Tico (Kelly Maria Tran)\\, Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) and DJ (Benico Del Toro)...really!?  Who cares!!  Big letdown and not what I was looking for in the Star Wars franchise.  I won't be seeing this a second time in the theater and if Rian Johnson is directing the new trilogy\\, I won't be seeing it open weekend but rather when I have the time to see it.","true":true}
