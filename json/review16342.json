Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm now too old to really be the target market for the saga\\, but even so I loved it. Sure there are problems with it if you really look closely\\, but that's not what it's all about. It's about how the movie makes you feel\\, and I felt 8 years old all over again. \\nThis is Star Wars for our kids\\, not for the kids of 40 years ago.","true":true}
