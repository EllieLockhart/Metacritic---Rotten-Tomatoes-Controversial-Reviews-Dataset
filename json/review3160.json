Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Basically taking the first 3 (A New Hope\\, The Empire Strikes Back\\, Return of the Jedi) mixed in a blender then half poured in the trash and half mixed with a D level movie to make this. Recycled scenes without the actual story to flow as a single movie. Felt long and forced but nothing like you would hope\/expect from a Star Wars movie. The original characters are tossed away with horrible newly created character flaws while the new ones still do not have any allure since there is no character - they have little to no substance.","true":true}
