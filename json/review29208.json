{"101487":164826,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-21","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Remember the beginning of Legally Blonde\\, when Elle spends ages getting ready for her date with Warner; she's super excited for it and she puts all this effort into what she's going to wear\\, what perfume to use\\, she does her nails\\, makes her hair look nice\\, shaves her legs\\, gets cheered out of the house by her friends\\, they go to somewhere fancy for dinner ... but instead of getting engaged\\, Warner turns out to be a giant prick and dumps her out of nowhere in the middle of the restaurant? Well\\, that was basically my experience with Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. \\n\\nWARNING: spoilers ahead.\\n\\nI had such high hopes for this movie. Two years\\, I waited for this. I was optimistic\\, and went into the movie with genuine excitement. I was wrong\\, unfortunately. I was too na\u00efve. Right now\\, I've pretty much lost all faith in this franchise\\, and even thinking about watching the original films right now just makes me angry. I don't think I'd feel as bad if I hadn't liked The Force Awakens\\, like others didn't. Because then I'd be able to ignore the sequel trilogy and pretend it doesn't exist. But that movie is the reason I decided to watch Star Wars in the first place. I'd heard there was a new movie coming out in a year\\, and I thought it was time for me to give the movies a try. Besides\\, I loved VII and felt it was a worthy sequel. But this just let me down so much because it pretty much rendered the preceding movie COMPLETELY POINTLESS.\\n\\nI think Luke chucking his father's lightsaber over his shoulder and down a cliff perfectly sets the tone for this bloody movie ... in the sense that Rian Johnson carelessly tosses aside everything that was set up in VII\\, and even several things from the originals. And then the lightsaber literally gets snapped in two\\, in case you didn't get the message already. I couldn't believe what I was watching.\\n\\nCharacterisation\\, plot-points\\, motives? All out the window.\\n\\nYou wanted to find out who Rey's parents are? Instead she's turned into a boring\\, bland plot device who inexplicably wants to redeem Kylo Ren all of a sudden\\, whose parents apparently sold her for drinking money then died on Jakku - as revealed in a throwaway line by the bad guy\\, and never brought up again. Rendering all those hints at her past in the previous movie\\, that Force-vision\\, the Skywalker lightsaber calling to her\\, the same music playing when she grabs the lightsaber as when Luke found his aunt and uncle's bodies in A New Hope? No reason for ANY of that. No reason at all. After two years of this \\\"mystery box\\\"\\, THIS is the payoff.\\n\\nAnd she somehow becomes a fully-fledged Jedi in just a few days?? Even though Luke didn't even train her. Two lessons out of three\\, he gave her ... which weren't even lessons. She learnt to feel the Force. That's it. Speaking of which\\, where was the \\\"beating heart of the film\\\" we were promised by Johnson regarding Luke and Rey's relationship? Because there was none of that to be found\\, or any of that rubbish about \\\"familial themes\\\" or them \\\"helping each other become whole again\\\" or whatever the hell Entertainment Weekly said. He straight-up LIED to his audience\\, and that doesn't sit well with me\\, at all.\\n\\nAnd that's not even getting into that totally forced \\\"relationship\\\" between her and Kylo (who basically used her). It doesn't even show how she went from \\\"You're a monster\\\" to \\\"IT WASN'T HIS FAULT!!\\\" properly. If this was going to happen\\, it should have AT LEAST been convincing. You're telling me that Rey would confide in the manchild who murdered her father figure\\, seriously injured Finn\\, tried to kill her twice\\, and invaded her mind\\, causing her serious discomfort and fear - which JJ Abrams blatantly said was a parallel to RAPE? Just ... no. This wasn't even shown believably\\, anyway. She deserved so much better from Johnson. I found myself not liking her in this one despite being one of my favourites from VII.\\n\\nAnd that cave scene. It is never properly explained what this is\\, exactly. Something about it being related to the Dark Side\\, then she goes in and there's some weirdness with multiple Reys. Why\\, exactly? And WHY was that cave calling to her if there was nothing down there for her in the first place? That whole scene is ultimately pointless too. She doesn't find out anything\\, or learn anything\\, there isn't any foreshadowing (unless you take the implication that \\\"Rey only sees herself instead of her drunken parents!\\\" which\\, again\\, fails to take into account everything she saw in the preceding film that set up her parents NOT being \\\"nobody\\\". None of that is mentioned again. This scene makes no sense.)\\n\\nYou wanted to see Finn again\\, being a hero\\, and to learn more about his past? Instead he is completely sidelined in a plot where ultimately nothing was accomplished\\, and a forced romance between he and Rose that comes out of nowhere after zero development. Not to mention how awful it felt to have a black character and Asian character sidelined like they were. It kind of felt like the plot was set up to rid Finn from the main story. AND THE WHOLE PLOT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF HOLDO HAD TOLD POE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND NOT BEEN SECRETIVE FOR NO REASON. WHAT WAS THE POINT?!\\n\\nDo you KNOW how excited I was to see Finn again? AND to be introduced to Rose?? Yet she was boring as hell\\, Finn's awakening from his coma was played as a joke\\, the injury is never mentioned again\\, and they basically didn't contribute ANYTHING to the main plot. Again\\, it almost felt like that storyline was hastily set up to get rid of Finn and keep him away from Rey for the whole movie\\, making him a supporting character instead of the male protagonist like he's supposed to be.\\n\\nAnd Poe ... oh\\, Poe. He didn't deserve to be written how he was. Suddenly constantly angry and uncaring about the lives of his comrades?? COME ON. \\n\\nAnd Rey\\, Finn and Poe ALL have such weak character arcs. They're all basically in the same place they were at the start. Nothing is accomplished. Rey fails to bring back Luke Skywalker but can lift rocks now\\, Finn ultimately achieves NOTHING\\, and Poe. Poor\\, poor Poe. The entire movie just felt kind of ... pointless.\\n\\nAnd don't get me started on Snoke. After being set up as a huge threat in the previous film\\, leaving fans wondering who he is\\, how he turned Kylo\\, how powerful he is....he just dies. After we learned nothing about him. Just dead\\, anticlimatically.\\n\\nAnd I don't like how Han was just... forgotten about. He's mentioned twice\\, and we don't even get to see Luke's reaction to his death. Or Chewbacca moving past this\\, his grieving. We barely see Chewie at all! That's not getting into LANDO. WHY WAS HE NOT IN THIS??? I also wish that we had seen more of Leia. Of course\\, there's nothing that can be done about that now\\, tragically. Seeing her FINALLY use the Force was very satisfying (although I wish there wasn't that...Poppinsy vibe to it). It's so so sad how we WERE going to get more of her. Which honestly\\, kind of makes things harder.\\n\\nHere's the final straw for me: how they handled Luke Skywalker. Starting with how after two years\\, the scene where Rey hands him his father's lightsaber is turned into a punchline. You wanted to see him back in action\\, with his green lightsaber? Instead he's extremely out of character\\, and considered using that green lightsaber TO KILL HIS KID NEPHEW\\, HIS BEST FRIEND'S AND SISTER'S SON\\, IN HIS SLEEP. The same man who refused to kill his father\\, was kind\\, hopeful\\, and saw the good in the most unthinkable places. That man is GONE. He stays on Ahch-to the whole movie like a coward\\, and when you think he'll have a big fight scene\\, which was actually pretty cool - he turns out to be an illusion?!\\n\\nAnd then... I'm still having trouble processing this. He dies. He suffers a completely unnecessary\\, completely pointless death. All alone. This last part is such a huge slap in the face on top of everything else. He was my favourite Star Wars character. He meant so much to me. And they killed him. Both literally and characterisation-wise. And this feels even cheaper and as though it was done for \\\"SHOCK VALUE\\\" because this is one movie after Han died. I know what Mark Hamill meant now when he said how much he disagreed with the direction the character took. And I just want to tell him how sorry I am. I didn't listen.\\n\\nI was perfectly fine with Luke having hit a low before this movie came out. Every hero has their low-point. I understood. But after watching it\\, what I DIDN'T understand was the reason behind this low-point. Luke would never even consider killing his nephew. The real Luke would have realised that there was darkness within\\, that Snoke was already manipulating him ... and he would try to HELP him! NOT STRAIGHT-UP CONSIDER KILLING HIM! It honestly feels like this was put in because Johnson wanted us to feel sorry for poor\\, poor Ben who did nothing wrong in his life\\, ever. And yes\\, this is sarcasm.\\n\\nAnd ... I know I'm confused and angry as hell as to why Rey chose to confide in KYLO REN of all people\\, but I'm honestly disgusted that Luke would make her feel like she's \\\"never felt so alone\\\" in the first place. That doesn't sit well with me either. Not only is it out of character for him to be as cruel and treat someone like garbage like this\\, to abandon someone like this\\, to make them feel THAT alone\\, but ... \\\"beating heart\\\"? Really?\\n\\nI think Luke was in character like once or twice\\, I guess? I did like Luke and Leia's reunion (which is kind of negated when it turns out he's not really there and made much more horrible when HE dies and knowing that Carrie Fisher is also dead in real life) and the scene when he and R2-D2 were reunited ... but then never speak again. Artoo doesn't even care that they left him behind so Rey can redeem poor\\, angsty\\, misunderstood Ben. The same droid who went into low power mode for YEARS because Luke went away. He would not leave him again! In fact\\, Artoo was barely in this. Neither is Threepio. Of freaking course.\\n\\nOtherwise\\, this was NOT Luke Skywalker. This was a walking middle finger to the character I was so in love with in the original trilogy. I have to say \\\"was\\\" now\\, because this movie has kind of tainted him for me.\\n\\nThis movie just felt like a bad fanfiction. Johnson was so obsessed with making this \\\"Kylo Ren Did Nothing Wrong: The Movie\\\" and \\\"subverting expectations\\\" that he sacrificed everything that Star Wars is about along the way. Hope\\, for one thing. I left this movie with none\\, instead feeling completely dejected and wondering if this was some practical joke. People - Johnson included - have to learn that just because a story is \\\"UNEXPECTED\\\"\\, doesn't make it good storytelling. The Force will ... probably not be with me for a long while.\\n\\nAnd to add insult to injury: nobody even said \\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\\".","true":true}
