Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible movie all-around. The characters are bland and uninteresting\\, though calling them characters is a stretch. Luke Skywalker\\, a beloved character\\, has been utterly butchered to the point of being unrecognizable. I left the cinema disappointed\\, and with two questions. What on earth was Ryan Johnson smoking when he made this trash heap of a movie\\, and where can I get some? Literal garbage\\, I'd give 0\/5 if I could.","true":true}
