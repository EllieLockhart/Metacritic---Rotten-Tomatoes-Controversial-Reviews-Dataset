Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Plot holes\\, forced comedy\\, and missed opportunities for great story telling brought this down immensely... The lack of subtle cohesion with the first film and so many lucky coincidences \/ lazy construction of plot devices became frustrating. With that said\\, it did have it's moments.  My mouth was open for a few surprises and scenes that are quite the spectacle worth of a theater visit.  All in all\\, they had major potential here\\, but fell short.","true":true}
