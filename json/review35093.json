Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I watched this movie I couldn't believe that I hated it. So I paid to see it a second time and hated it even worse. Starts off with a scene that's supposed to make you nervous and afraid and turns it into a joke. Turned Luke into a joke. Turned snoke into a joke. Left the story with no direction. A useless casino. Scene. I can go on and on about how bad this movie is.. I'm shocked it's ratings are this high to be honest. Rian stole a star wars movie from us  that we will never get back.","true":true}
