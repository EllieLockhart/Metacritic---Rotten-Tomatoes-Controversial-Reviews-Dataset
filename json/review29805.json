Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Right\\, it's time to take my turn on this film. Episode VIII is bit diferent than the VII. In many ways the film kind of kills off loads of previous storylines and also the hype surrounding few characters and fan theories. I liked bit light approach with the jokes. I liked the film but this \\\"Skywalker\\\" Storyline is tired. End it well and never come back with any other sequel.","true":true}
