Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is definitely one of the best movies in the series. Director Johnson's vision of the philosophy of force is absolutely brilliant. The development of characters like Kylo\\, ??Leia and even Luke is amazing. Visually it is spectacular. A mixture of nostalgia and new stories that abandons that sad lack of creativity that we saw in its mediocre predecessor The Force Awakens. The great problem with this film is that feeling that leaves in the audience: The story did not advance\\, is the same as before. Well\\, this is due to the lack of coordination between directors Johnson and Abrams\\, which resulted in the great unknowns raised by The Force Awakens remain unanswered. In addition\\, great characters such as Snoke\\, Phasma and Finn were wasted without meaning. In definition\\, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an amazing\\, interesting movie\\, with a lot of potential that was not made to continue the trilogy\\, causing its great virtues to be overshadowed by its incredible defects. An extraordinary film that does not improve but worsens the battered path of this sequel trilogy started by the poor The Force Awakens. Episode IX will tell us if the trilogy was saved or if it ends up being a fiasco worse than the prequels. A real shame.","true":true}
