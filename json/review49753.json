{"101487":199635,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wtf?? This movie was a huge mess. I mean absolutely terrible. Horrible plot\\, terrible dialog\\, poor acting\\, bad comedy\\, and the list goes on and on. I literally need to shower to wash the stench of this film off of me. They totally destroyed Luke's character and turned Leia into a flying fairy. They made an absolute mockery of the force. Did the director even bother to watch the original trilogy before writing this movie? I was soooo looking forward to this movie after the awesome ending of the Force Awakens. What a let down. I really hope the third one will be half decent\\, but to be honest\\, with Luke and Leia gone\\, I really don't care about Star Wars anymore. RIP Star Wars franchise\\, this was the final nail in the coffin!\\n\\nI could write a book about everything that was wrong with this movie. But let's start with Princess Leia flying through space like Mary Poppins. Or Yoda controlling weather and lightning. Or Luke astral projecting himself across the galaxy. If Luke was ready to die\\, why not just go to the planet for real and face Kylo Ren in person? When has the force ever been used in any of these three ways? The entire code breaker sequence was useless since they were betrayed anyhow (and why did they even go looking for the guy at the casino in the first place when they didn't even use him - instead they find Benicio in their cell -- how convenient. \\n\\nSnoke is built up to be the next Emperor and dies such a quick\\, insignificant death. Who was he? I guess we'll never know and why should we care since he's now dead. Kylo without a shirt on? Really?? Luke is a whiny little b*tch through the entire movie. Then he has thoughts of murdering Kylo Ren in cold blood? Ridiculous. In the original trilogy\\, Luke never lost hope\\, EVER. Even when Darth Vader cut off his hand he still held out hope he could turn him from the dark side. But suddenly\\, he's ready to kill Kylo Ren and commit an act of murder?? \\n\\nOMG\\, the list of stupid plot points goes on and on. Rey's parents are nobody? (I suspect Abrams will correct this in the next movie). Anyhow\\, it was absolutely horrible. The ride on the alien horses through the casino was idiotic and looked so fake -- there's no way they could have held onto that beast with nothing but a saddle and hand grip going through one window after the next. Also\\, the entire movie was pretty much one big chase scene through space with three really horrible sub plots (Rey & Kylo\\, Rey & Luke\\, and the codebreaker garbage). I couldn't stand Rose\\, and that final kiss with Finn.... Ewwww\\, I threw up in my mouth. \\n\\nMan\\, this was just AWFUL. I really don't know how any Star Wars fan could have thought this was a good movie. They even missed an excellent opportunity for Luke to use the force to lift his XWing out of the water and leave the island. Instead\\, he dies and becomes a force ghost\\, for no good reason. He milks an alien and goes spear fishing (dumb dumb dumb). Leia becomes Supergirl. etc etc etc. Just ridiculous. Horrible. Junk. \\n\\nAlmost forgot\\, the most insulting part of the film was at the beginning when Luke threw his lightsaber over the edge of the cliff after Rey returns it to him. Abrams creates a scene at the end of The Force Awakens that resonates with fans for two years. Rian Johnson basically said \\\"eff you\\\" to the fans when Luke threw the lightsaber off the cliff. This was exactly when I knew that this film was a fail and that Johnson should be fired. \\n\\nAgain\\, I could go on and on with all the stupid\\, idiotic garbage in this film but I'll stop here. I'm glad so many people enjoyed this movie\\, but I just can't figure out why. It was a long\\, convoluted mess with horrible story arcs. I enjoyed the new cast and the passing of the torch in Force Awakens\\, but I truly believe Rian Johnson destroyed everything that was decent about that film. Thank God Han Solo died in the first film\\, I'd hate to see how Rian Johnson would write his character in TLJ -- he probably would have been a horrible punchline.\\n\\nIf you are a true Star Wars fan\\, save your money and don't give Disney another dime. Personally\\, I'm out. I'll never see another Star Wars film after the shameful way they treated Luke Skywalker and the slap in the face to the fans by Rian Johnson. I only hope Abrams can figure out a way to clean this heaping pile of manure in Chapter 9. May the force strangle Rian Johnson and Disney.","true":true}
