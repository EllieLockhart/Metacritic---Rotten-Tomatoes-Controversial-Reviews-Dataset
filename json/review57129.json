Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is not Star Wars. This is a Disney piece of shit. Thank you Disney for successfully turning the Star Wars franchise into a new Transformers franchise. Filled with dumb\\, cringe worthy\\, pathetic\\, un-funny one liners. There are so many things going on with so many different characters\\, everyone is screaming for air time\\, and the small amount they are given is lack lustre. There is no continuation from The Force Awakens and the plot takes you on an illogical roller coaster ride\\, jumping from one scene to another\\, just to leave the last one hanging by a thread full of unanswered questions. Too many scenes were unnecessary and the entire lore of the Star Wars universe is replaced with something I cannot even explain. It lets you down\\, and keeps you down in the dumps from start to finish. Different writer\\, different story. Don't expect a Star Wars film\\, expect a Disney fantasy.","true":true}
