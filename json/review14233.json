Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i given one star as visually its great and that is it\\, you can't take one of the biggest cinematic characters in the history and destroy their legacy like that\\, it's disrespectful to us fans\\, i now realise my Star Wars is dead and this is simply for a new generation\\, fine but dont ruin my memories !!!","true":true}
