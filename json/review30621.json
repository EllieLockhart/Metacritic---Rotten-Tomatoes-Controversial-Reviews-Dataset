Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Simply fantastic. I don't get the neg response from public. Its a great transition movie from original trilogy to new. Sorry if it upset some apple carts along the way. I enjoyed every minute of the film\\, bravo Rian Johnson! The Force is strong with him.","true":true}
