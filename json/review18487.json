Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is not the usual Star Wars movie that fans are expecting. You can see the Disney style in a couple of jokes kind of the Marvel movies and it didn't kite work with Star Wars. The movie is way too long and some scenes feel like they change the flow of the movie. The story was really good and th end is everything but what you have imagined\\, but overall the movie fells heavy and complete different to the usual Star Wars movies.","true":true}
