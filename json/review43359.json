Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a huge waste of money. The plot doesn't make sense. There is zero of the magic of the original 3.  Didn't think it was possible but this is worse than the prequels. Any potentially good moments were usually ruined moments after. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.  No matter how much money Lucasfilm pumps into trying to persuade the internet that this movie was liked\\, it was not - theater was damn near empty when I went. Not sure if I'll see the next one.","true":true}
