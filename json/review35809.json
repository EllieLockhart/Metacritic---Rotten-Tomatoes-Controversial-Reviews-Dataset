Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is not worth your time.  The film is disheartening.  After the opening scene\\, the story is strangely boring with a meandering plot that will remind you of the Prequels.  The lead characters whine\\, constantly\\, from the emo Kylo Ren to the depressed Luke Skywalker.  The great struggle between good and evil has no point.  The Jedi and Sith do not seem to believe in much of any thing\\, and so the audience does not believe either.  The new characters do not seem to matter at all (though they all seem to be able to defeat the First Order in combat without much effort).  The bad guys are weak\\, the good guys are afraid\\, and we watch them all suffer while checking our phones.  The critics should be fired for praising this sorry film.","true":true}
