Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Aside from a few things\\, most of this movie is predictable. This is not the Star Wars you grew up with\\, but rather one that panders to its audience. It seems that the current trend is to copy the comedic beats of Guardians of the Galaxy\\, which was apparent in the new Thor as well as this latest installment of Star Wars. I was never a huge fan of the prequels\\, but after seeing this movie\\, they're liking a lot better in my eyes. I can't say that I'm looking forward to any further installments.","true":true}
