Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought that the cinematography and acting were amazing in the film. There were just too many plot holes\\, too many plot points from episode 7 that were dropped or otherwise had unsatisfactory results and way too much wasted character potential. Not just Luke but Phasma\\, Finn\\, and Rose. I wanted to like this movie more than I did and it was the first time I have seen a Star Wars movie and was unsure how I felt about it.","true":true}
