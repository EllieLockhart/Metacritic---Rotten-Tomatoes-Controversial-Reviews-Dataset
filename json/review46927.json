Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went with a large group last night 2 out of 15 gave it low marks. I really enjoyed it. I can see how it might be jarring to some fans. They basically set up things in the last movie that seemed important\\, but were basically head fakes. (trying not to spoil here). So for those wanting more in those story arcs\\, they were left disappointed. I think the movie does a great job pivoting in a new direction and setting up A LOT more potential movies down the line. My grade B+. PS - action sequences were the best of the franchise. IMHO I'll be seeing it again tomorrow.","true":true}
