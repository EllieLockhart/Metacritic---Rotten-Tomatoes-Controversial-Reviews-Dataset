Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful scenes that left me thrilled sometimes. But in general several plot twists without any explanation\\, plot holes that severely contradict what had already been established by the rest of the saga. Overall the movie turns out to be strong at some points\\, but has a weak narrative in general. Leaving disappointed whoever expected the story to be unleash by it\\, making it unpredictable precisely by ignoring (on several levels) things that all seven other films had already established.","true":true}
