Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am just absolutely stunned in a great way. Absolutely loved it...all of it. Yes RJ took risks but I think the time was right and I have no problem with the mantle being passed to these new characters. This coming from a guy who saw the ORIGINAL SW in the theater in 1977 as a 13 yr old!!!\\n\\nMy favorite scenes in no particular order\\n\\n- The cave\/mirror scene was just incredible cinematography. Stunning. Will be talked about for YEARS....we need a thread just on that one scene!\\n- Opening space battle was awesome....Poe once again is the X-Wing GOD\\n- Luke....Luke....where to begin. My most fave character of SW and I loved Hamill's performance. No problem with showing his human flaws\\n- Luke and Yoda \\, what a great throwback to PT\/OT....\\n- Loved showing Poe growing into a leader\\n- Snoke\/Kylo\/Rey showdown was superb - tense - well done all around. Awesome power of Snoke. Glimpse into Kylo's head.\\n- However\\, my most favorite scene was the last one with the random boy....wow so powerful on so many levels....what a great way to tie it all together","true":true}
