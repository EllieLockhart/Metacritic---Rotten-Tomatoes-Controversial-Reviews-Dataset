Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even thought this movie was better then TFA it still is filled with plot holes and boring stories. Luke's character is totally disrespected in this film and the new characters don't even develop. This feels like it just added more plot holes.","true":true}
