Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"**spoilers**\\n\\nFirst of all\\, forget all of the dumb \\\"fan theories\\\" that have been floating around the Internet for the past 2 years\\, we are still no closer to finding out who Rey's parents are. This film seemed to go out of its way to avoid answering any questions that we may have had at the end of TFA. So don't go to the cinema with any expectations of those being answered.\\n\\nThis film doesn't play it safe either\\, Luke is bitter and is afraid of failure\\, he is no longer the naive farm boy.Leia is still as tough in spirit as she always was\\, and it was nice to see Leia use the Force for once. Both actors do an excellent job\\, Mark is brilliant as Luke\\, you can literally see the painfull memories etched into face as he tries to persuade Rey to leave. \\n\\nCarrie looks like she is carrying the weight of the galaxy on her shoulders\\, as she should as Leia is still the leader of the Resistance\\, who are very much the galaxies only hope. \\n\\nOne special mention goes out to one scene in particular that had me in tears\\, once you see the film you will know which one.\\n\\nThe rest of the cast are great as well\\, although Finn I felt disappeared at some points. A special mentiuon goes out to Rey who is no longer the Mary Sue from TFA as she tries to persuade Luke to join the fight.\\n\\nAll in all\\, I enjoyed this film\\, it doesn't pander to the fans and follows it's own path while still stirring up memories from the original trilogy\\, and even\\, dare I say it\\, making a man like feel a little bit emotional.","true":true}
