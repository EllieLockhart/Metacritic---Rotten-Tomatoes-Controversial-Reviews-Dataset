The problem with this game is the complete assassination of the main characters\\, Joel was killed off in such a dumb way and to early\\, then they make you play the person who killed him in order to build sympathy for that character..except it doesn\u2019t work. The ending is even worse. Imagine going to see John Wick where he kills everyone except the actual person who killed his dog and then let him live. The story is a terrible twist on the cliche revenge plot used in all media and it is a complete kick in the face to all the fans of this franchise. There is good about this game though it has set a new bar for how games should look\\, sound\\, and play. Everything except the story is absolutely game of the year material but when you make a 30 hour long story game (mine took me far less but that is the designed time) but the story is absolute disrespectful garbage then you have no game at all. Personally I regret getting this game as i have been looking forward to it for 7 years. I\u2019ll just consider the end of tlou 1 as the canon ending since in my opinion I think the last of us is perfect (even it\u2019s flaws). I didn\u2019t expect this game to be better or as good as the first but it is the absolute worst it could possibly be in terms of storytelling.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
