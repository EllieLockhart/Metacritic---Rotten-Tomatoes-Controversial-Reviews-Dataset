Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally! A Star Wars made in the spirit of the original Star\\n Wars. I think and and all true Star Wars fans will enjoy this movie. Wish I can give it 10 STARS. Loved it!","true":true}
