Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are a Star Wars fan and haven't seen this yet. Please save your time and money. This movie destroys the hero's character which has been developed over the entire saga.The largest plot holes in a movie series I've ever witnessed. I'd give 0 stars if possible.","true":true}
