Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so bad that it retroactively made the original trilogy bad! An almost impossible feat!\\n\\nBesides the character assassination of Luke\\, Rain Johnson\\, in hist ignorance\\, destroyed the consistency of the Star Wars universe itself:\\n\\n- 6000 years of the Jedi Order has taught us that it takes dedicated training to master the force: fight with a lightsaber\\, move objects\\, perform the \\\"mind trick\\\"\\, etc. But Rey can do these things within days of discovering she has the force.\\n\\n- Hyperspace ramming is not possible for a reason: hyperspace is another dimension! Otherwise you would be going through things ALL THE TIME - space is not empty. Mass proximity can knock you out of hyperspace\\, but then you are no longer traveling at hyper-speeed when you hit something!\\n\\n- Force ghosts cannot (may not!) affect the physical world! If this were possible then any major force user could achieve any goal by dying\\, because\\, as a ghost\\, they cannot be stopped!\\n\\n- Joda who has been a Jedi for most of his 900 years\\, suddenly and without explanation\\, decides that the Jedi texts are junk (have you read them?)\\, and destroys them.\\n\\nThis movie is a kick in the teeth to anyone who is a real fan. I would rate it less than one star\\, but I have heard that rotten tomatoes ignores those ratings\\, hence the 1 star.","true":true}
