Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I first watched it I loved it but after thinking about it and the plot holes as well as throwing away so much from previous films I am left dissatisfied. Rey BB8 were awesome in this and Kylo had a better performance from the last film. Space battles were awesome. If it were a standalone non star wars film I would have giving it 4.5 stars.","true":true}
