Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"WARNING! There are spoilers. After all I wrote this for the devoted\\, but disappointed Star Wars fan. \\n\\nIf you haven't seen it yet\\, go see it. It's worth it. Don't read the rest of this. If you have seen it and are still complaining about it\\, read on.\\n\\nThe disparity in the Tomatometer between critics and viewers was perhaps the biggest shocker of the whole Last Jedi release. When critics go gaga like they did with the 93% fresh rating and at the audience goes blah like they did with the 56% rating\\, something's amiss. Usually it means we are dealing with some pretentious filming that impresses the critics but really lacks the ability to connect with anybody else.\\n\\nIn this case\\, however\\, it's almost the opposite. The people dissing Last Jedi are the Star Wars elitists and spiritualists. These are they who see the franchise from a religious view where symmetry is everything and where homage means repetition. To them\\, this is what made this film's predecessor so delightful. It was a reboot that was merely a retelling. \\n\\nFans wanted more of that. They wanted to know that Rey and Kylo were siblings\\, or at least cousins or possibly betrothed children of Jedi royalty. They wanted  Snoke to be even greater than Palpatine even to the point of being the guy who can raise folks from the dead. They wanted a Luke whose every word was filled with Yoda like profundity. They had fan theories and matching fictions that they wanted validated.\\n\\nMost of all\\, they wanted a repeat of the Melodrama of Episodes III\\, IV\\, and V. Instead\\, they got a deconstruction of them. This pissed them off with a piss that has the force of a car wash spray wand. For this reason alone\\, they have shouted the film's suckage from the roof tops of their backyard replicas of the Jedi Temples.\\n\\nBut the movie doesn't suck. It's a great film\\, possibly second only to the Empire Strikes Back. In fact the offended should be proud.  The Last Jedi takes all of it's cues from Episode IV's lack of moral certainty. It does an excellent job at expounding them.\\n\\nIt's creators have shown a certain courage in whittling down Lucas's melodramatics. They should've chosen to completely saw off his horrible storytelling habits. If the film has any fault\\, it's that it holds to much of the cutesy comic relief. Fortunately\\, we are nowhere near Jar Jar territory\\, but a little less of it would have improved the experience. Also\\, I could have done without Leia's miraculous return which is way to old school for me.\\n\\nEven with these very minor annoyances\\, this movie does make a clear statement about canon. It very clearly tells those who view Lucas as the deity of a sacrosanct canon to grow up. It was time to tell a story for today's audience.\\n\\nThe audience before them is not wowed by the special effects that got much of New Hope and Return of the Jedi through their stilted dialogues; a fact that was made painfully clear by the prequels. Furthermore\\, this audience doesn't see the absolute black and white of war that once held the ideals of a generation\\, even after Vietnam. \\n\\nTheir audience is too aware of the fact that violent battles come with ugly realities that are often covered up. They've had two decades of questionable military actions. They understand war isn't always about right versus wrong. They know war comes with war profiteering.  They realize that bravery is not a replacement for intellect\\, experience\\, and wisdom. They know that not every act of heroism succeeds and that many heroic acts don't involve the use of weapons at all.\\n\\nThey also know that midichlorians are idiotic and that a return to mysticism and metaphysics is a better explanation of powers beyond our physical limitations and understanding. \\n\\nWe lose the melodrama which means we enjoy much more nuanced characters than those of yesteryear.  The confident are less confident\\, the heroes are less heroic\\, and the scoundrels act more like scoundrels. \\n\\nThe deathbed redemption of Vader is gone. Kylo's act saves Rey\\, but not himself. In fact\\, he may be even worse off. The truth about Rey's past is much less dramatic\\, and all the more surprising and deep because of it. \\n\\nWe are left to conclude that rebellion isn't always the answer\\, that people don't grow last minute consciouses and sometimes leave with the cash\\, and that being one with the force\\, involves a price that's paid when it's all they have left to pay.\\n\\nThe symmetry and instant rewards we got from the past are not freely given. No win or loss is complete. \\n\\nThis somewhat morally ambiguous Star Wars upsets the fragile universe of a devoted fan base that has grown more inflexible as it has gotten larger. The film creates it's own disturbance in its own force. \\n\\nIndeed\\, the greatest rebellion is that of the filmmakers.  They have dared to go straight to the face of the fan and declare their religion a creative enemy. Some will turn to the light of new ideals and others will remain committed to the darkness of tired old tropes.\\n\\nThose who love a good story will be well rewarded. Those clinging to the remnants of their old Lucasian faith are being rocked to their core. They have fought back; not with their wallets\\, just with their vitriol.","true":true}
