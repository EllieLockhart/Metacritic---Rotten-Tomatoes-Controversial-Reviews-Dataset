Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a film\\, it's nothing short of a great experience. However\\, as the sequel to episode VII\\, it was arguably more disappointing than any other Star Wars Film. The plot was confusing\\, it lacked character development\\, and had an extremely anticlimactic ending. It seems as if they took the safest\\, most predictable route they could have for episode VIII. After episode VII\\, you are left with many questions\\, and that's what I was looking forward to most about this film. Did get down to what I was curious about? No\\, not at all and what it did answer\\, it was boring and\/or not as exciting as it could have been. The cinematography and acting were the most redeeming factors of the movie\\, but that's not enough to pass it off as a memorable Star Wars film. My opinion may vary when episode IX is release but for now\\, the disappointment of the film is physically painful.","true":true}
