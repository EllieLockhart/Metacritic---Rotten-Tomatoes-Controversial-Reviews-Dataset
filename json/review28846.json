Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Read some real reviews (not paid critic reviews) and was debating about even seeing this\\, but scored some free tickets so figured what the heck. I want my three hours back! I thought JarJar was the nail in the coffin for the star wars franchise\\, but oh nooooo this has definitely been that nail. from bombs that drop in space (hello gravity?) to the horrible comic relief (if you call it that) with Gen Hux at the beginning\\, the horrible political undertones of the movie I wish I could give this steaming pile of donkey poo a 1\/4 star. The only reason it gets a high school is merely for the final scene when the ship went to light speed\\, that was pretty epic visually.","true":true}
