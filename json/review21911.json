Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Just.... ruined all of the potential TFA set up. For the first time ever as a die hard Star Wars fan who even found enjoyment out of the prequels\\, I just don't care what happens next. This film has literally made me not care about Star Wars. This movie makes me appreciate Jar Jar.  This movie made me wish the world did end in 2012 so I would never have my and so many else's  beloved star wars just ruined","true":true}
