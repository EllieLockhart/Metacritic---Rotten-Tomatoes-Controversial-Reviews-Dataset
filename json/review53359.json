Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Excellent movie - don't believe the hate from the self described 'fans' who love the disaster and soul-less vapid money grab that was rogue one. This movie has stakes\\, heart\\, wit\\, and cleverness. Everything is intentional and the viewer is rewarded with a thoughtful film going experience instead of something flashy and stupid. if you liked rogue one and you diss this movie go take any kind of class on any kind of story telling. Then again... looking at the state of the world\\, it's easy to see a majority of morons blabbing their useless uninformed opinions out in the world. This movie will go down as one of the greats.","true":true}
