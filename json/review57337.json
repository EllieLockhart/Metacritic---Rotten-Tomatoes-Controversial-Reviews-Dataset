Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is pure rubish. It completely ignores the events of The Force Awakens (which I don't mind sometimes since that movie was too trash). Luke Skywalker\\, the most powerful Jedi in history\\, is isolated to an island\\, contributes zero to the movie and is made out to be a bum. There is a forced relationship between Fin and this new Rose character. The subplot with them contributes nothing to the story. Nothing is accomplished in this film. The build to the climax takes 98% of the time just to have the big moment dangled in front of you\\, pulled away\\, and fade off into the sunset. Very bad movie. 1.735\/10","true":true}
