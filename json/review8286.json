Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fascinating. Not the best\\, but interesting to see more intentional humour and more slow-paced developmental stuff than we've seen for a while in SW. Very different from what's come before. Disappointing to hear some unnecessary language in it. Otherwise\\, very good\\, but not excellent. Will see it again.","true":true}
