Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi serves its viewers a new type of adventure with new characters and experiences. For those looking to rehash previous trilogies and characters\\, this is not for you. Unfortunately those who go in thinking that this movie is like every other Star Wars movie is mistaken. As Luke says\\, \\\"this is not going to go the way you think\\\". And why should it? We have already had the I'm your father storyline. Who wants to watch another Empire? Don't get me wrong I loved the original trilogy\\, but this isn't meant to be a repeat of it. Failure is a major theme of this movie and that is the point. Not everyone is going to win all the time (that includes the fan boys who are giving this movie 1\/2 stars and hoping the last movie changes because of it). If you don't understand the point of the movie than you should rewatch a few times. The movie isn't a clear dark and light side type of movie. That would make things too cut and dry and in my opinion\\, BORING. It's unfortunate that people don't understand ambiguity at all. Particularly fans who are stuck in the past. \\\"Let the past die\\\"\\, it's time to move forward with something new and different. Besides some little side stories that I didn't care for (i.e. Poe and Holdo)\\, The Last Jedi serves one of the deepest and emotionally moving films of all time pushing the idea that being good or bad is not as simple as we believe.","true":true}
