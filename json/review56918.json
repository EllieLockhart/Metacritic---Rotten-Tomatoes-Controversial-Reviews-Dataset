Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The utter mediocrity of this movie is astounding. Parts were so bad\\, it almost broke my heart. Star Wars will forever be my favorite movie franchise\\, but I'm afraid Disney has wrapped its claws around it\\, and turning it in to the same pomp and circumstance movie with terrible plot lines\\, similar to the Transformers-like flicks of modern day. Mark Hamill almost single handedly saves this film with his performance. Lord I hope a large overhaul comes for episode 9. One can only hope.","true":true}
