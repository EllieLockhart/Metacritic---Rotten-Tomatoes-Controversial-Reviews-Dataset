Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I sat transfixed at the screen when i went to see this in the cinema. Not because the movie was so good that i didn't want to miss a moment\\, no because i could not believe what i was watching . A hotchpotch mish mash of ideas thrown at the screen which have little or no bearing on what has gone before in The Force Awakens . It has the Star Wars name but that is as close as it gets to being a Star Wars movie. I have no problem with movies and franchises going in new directions but first and foremost they have to tell a good story and they must bear some relation to the movies which have gone before. This does neither. This is like being presented with your favourite meal only to realise after you have eaten it that you have been poisoned. A truly awful film and the pro-feminism\\, anti-male agenda which pervades every scene is sickening. And don't get me started on what they did to Luke Skywalker. It would have been more sensitive to the character had Rey pushed him over the cliff at the start of the movie. At least he would have died with his dignity intact. This is the last Star Wars movie i will ever watch. A steaming big pile of Wookie sh*t !!","true":true}
