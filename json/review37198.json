Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"- The pauper children were straight out of Oliver Twist and kind of uncomfortable and the film ends with some kid who I can only assume has a terrible cockney accent and is like\\, a chimney sweep or something\\, using a broom as a lightsaber.\\n\\nAnyway\\, at least the prequels are watchable now.","true":true}
