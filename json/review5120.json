Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Critics will love this film\\, fans not so much. Lots of new things to love and some great additions to the universe. However it didn't feel like an episode\\, there was almost no follow through on the part fans wanted fleshed out the most\\, many jokes and odd choices made across the board. Will still be seeing every movie related\\, just not a classic...loved half of it\\, hated the other.","true":true}
