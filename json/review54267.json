{"101487":132988,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-16","3":4,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I 'get' the complaints and many of them are justified (there are at least 15 or so\\, many of which are quite valid). Particularly I found the entire chase scene unbelievable. Worse than that was the constant exposition.\\nThere is really no excuse for this\\, Disney. Thirdly\\, Finn is more or less a filler character. He added little in TFA and less in TLJ. Fourth\\, I found the Jedi training to be even less believable than the star ship chase. However\\, I think there are a few issues with the complaints of this film as well.\\n\\nThat being said\\, I completely disagree that meta the story choices\\, not plot points were poorly chosen. Luke was meant to die\\, Leia was meant to live. Snoke was also a distraction from the story line\\, a great character but highly problematic. All the meta choices were well thought through. The plot to get there was anything but\\, it was \\\"C-D\\\" sci-fi flick rubbish.\\nYou see the cultural and character development of backdrop of the story was great\\, the races\\, the casino\\, the narrow chases\\, the excellent sub plot characters and stories were all great. And honestly loved the humor\\, it was fun and somewhat Oz esque. Likewise the conflict between Rey and Kylo was enough to be interesting.\\nWhat destroyed this movie from being great was the convoluted\\, often ridiculous enough to unbelievable major plot points.\\nIn Rian's defense\\, I think he was handed a hot mess\\, JJ Abram's made a much less interesting film. Super force users beating somewhat trained jedi\\, and unceremoniously terrible execution of  of the most memorable character in the canon\\, all at a hot and now pace.\\nBoth movies suffer from a real lack of main character development that isn't spoonfed.","true":true}
