Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A bold new direction for star wars\\, plenty of twists and not just a rehash like the force awakens. I am 48 and have been a life long star wars fan\\, this film gave me the same feelings I had when I originally saw a new hope and empire and its  the first time since then I have felt this. (Although the Leia in space was a bit much)","true":true}
