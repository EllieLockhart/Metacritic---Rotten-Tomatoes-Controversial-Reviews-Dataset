The craftsmanship and polish is unlike anything I've ever seen before.\r\rI don't think I've ever been more affected by a video game emotionally in my life and I don't think I will for quite some time. Everything about this experience was mature and adult and so very raw. The characters are more genuine than ANY other zombie style form of media and the direction from Neil Druckman is absolutely masterclass.\r\rEllie's character developed between games exactly as you would expect growing up in that world and her actions became increasingly deplorable. You see why she is so filled with hate at the lack of real closure and the survivors remorse she feels knowing her life will never be worth more than what was stolen from her in the original entry.\r\rWhen Istarted the game I thought some of the criticisms and negativity I'd heard must have some credence and earnestness to them but the more i played the better I understood the types of people that give this game a low score are unfortunately lacking emotional intelligence. Something I've seen becoming more and more prevalent\\, and it's devastatingly disheartening.\r\rPeople so often lack the mental acumen to be able to discern a dark and harrowing tale from a \\\"BaD StOrY\\\" and it shows. I've read so many 0 or 2 star reviews saying things are just thrown together or make no sense and I just have to shake my head in sorrow at how far these people missed the mark. It's not a case for opinions\\, it's that this is such a mature\\, evocative tale that so many people (still a minority\\, however vocal) simply lack the ability to appreciate...\r\rI could spend an afternoon detailing everything this game does right\\, but these things must be experienced for yourself and it was far more important for me to volcalise my thoughts on the negativity this game received and quantify exactly why.\r\rTLDR-\rSimply put\\, you wouldn't expect everyone to be able to provide a worthwhile opinion on stem cell research\\, so you shouldn't expect everyone to be able to provide a worthwhile opinion on an experience that does so much over it's lengthy journey.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
