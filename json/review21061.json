Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was really looking forward to see The Last Jedi after The Force Awakens was really good reboot movie. But this not only a bad movie it's also A BAD STAR WARS MOVIE. Episode 9 would have to be really impressive correction\/explanation festival to make this movie make any sense. BUT I'm afraid it won't be. Some plots don't go anywhere and charecters have no reasoning behind their actions what so ever.","true":true}
