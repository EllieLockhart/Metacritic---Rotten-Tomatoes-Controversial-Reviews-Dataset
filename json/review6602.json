Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Do I really need to explain? They killed Luke's personality\\, MaRey Sue\\, \\\"We win by saving what we love\\\"\\, the universe bends so that the main characters don't die\\, Snoke\\,. The movie is a complete mess. I didn't even know Luke died until about a week after I watched the movie because I got out of the cinema before the end because I couldn't handle it.","true":true}
