Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"+1 Star for some really cool fight scenes\\n+1 Star for some really great visuals\\nI'm probably getting rid of my last Jedi t-shirt after this and I'm not overly interested in seeing another movie like this.  I feel like this will be another Phantom Menace; a movie that I watch every once in a while to re watch a few scenes but that's about it.","true":true}
