Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was entertaining but as one of the Star Wars franchise films\\, it was disappointing.  Diversity for the sake of diversity was irritating.  Leia and the general are not convincing as military revel commanders.  They're like some liberal fantasy of what the universe would look like if they were in charge of the military.  Other plot holes are typical for blockbusters but this combined with the other Disneyfication elements make the franchise almost unwatchable.  Not as bad as what was done to Sat Trek Trek though in the latest movies and tv series.","true":true}
