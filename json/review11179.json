Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly A Disappointment\\, Only 2 Good Scenes (Throne Room Battle\\, Hyperspace Kamikaze Scene) Throughout The Film. They Degraded The Legacy Of The Skywalkers\\, Destroyed Everything Starwars Stood For\\, Destroyed Everything Like Stood For\\, And There Wasn\u2019t Even A Lighstaber Clash. Also\\, How Dare They Throw Away All The Interesting Subplots From The Force Awakens After Teasing Us For 3 Years. As A Fan Of Star Wars I\u2019m Very Let Down.","true":true}
