Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why Rian Johnson? Not his fault but who gave him the keys? He had never proven he could handle this. People that say these negative reviews are fake are not even remotely Star Wars fans. The end of all things Star Wars for me and I'm guessing almost all true fans. When the Phantom Menace was over you had the feeling they could recover. Not this time shame on Disney and whomever let Rian touch this great movie series.","true":true}
