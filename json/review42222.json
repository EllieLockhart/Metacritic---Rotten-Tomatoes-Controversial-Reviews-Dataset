Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie's main theme of \\\"letting the past die\\\" resonated with me in a way Disney likely did not expect\\, in that I realize that maybe it's time to let go of the Star Wars that I remember and recognize that this series isn't really for me anymore.","true":true}
