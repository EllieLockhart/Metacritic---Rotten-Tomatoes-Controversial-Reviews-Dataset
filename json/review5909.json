Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing. I liked it\\, but the kind of like that can wait until it comes out on DVD. Some of the humor seemed misplaced in the film\\, like the timing of when they decided to add humor was off. For those of us who have been watching the movie since 1977...the writing for the original characters was definitely off\\, It was like Luke was a completely different character. I\u2019m not a big Star Wars fanatic but just someone who has watched and enjoyed them since they first came out. And I didn\u2019t hate it. I was just disappointed. ","true":true}
