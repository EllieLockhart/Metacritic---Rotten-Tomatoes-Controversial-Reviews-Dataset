Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is the worst or next to worst Star Wars. DOes not fell like the middle of a trilogy\\, this movie might have worked as episode 9 but as 8 it literally leaves NOTHING for episode 9. Just changes a age old character and kills off some new ones and old ones and a side plot that has nothing to do with the story. People actually booed in the theaters when I saw it during two or three scenes. Nothing fresh or new\\, just a jumpled mess with no point but for the director\/writer to throw out all the stuff from earlier star wars movies\\, even TFA.  Never been this disappointed leaving a theater. It took me months to realize Episode one was bogus\\, I realized this one was half way into this movie.  A man dressed up for the movie fell asleep duing it a few rows in front of me and his friends provided more enjoyment than did this WASTE of a movie. Get Johnson away from this franchise now\\, or take it in the back and put it to sleep forever.","true":true}
