Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's hard to believe that so many people liked this movie.  It was very disjointed and fragmented with too many characters and plot lines some not going anywhere.  It's pretty much obvious that the main selling point of the movie is continuous action.  Princess Leah finally shows some Jedi skills which we have been waiting for since the Last Hope.  Unfortunately\\, I just wanted to laugh because it was so phoney.  Luke Skywalker spends most of the movie getting over a childish tantrum.  His story with Kyler Ren also does not make any sense.","true":true}
