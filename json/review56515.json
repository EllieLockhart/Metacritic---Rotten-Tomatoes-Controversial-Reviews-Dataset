{"101487":174698,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":3,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good - there is one of the best light saber battles in the series\\, along with other satisfying moments. The graphics are top of the line\\, this is the most visually stunning yet.  Even with all the forced humor\\, there are some truly funny moments\\, though they went overboard. Rey and Kylo\\, though poor characters\\, have improved since the last film\\, and have a believable dynamic.\\n\\nThe bad- Almost every thing else is boring\\, unnecessary\\, or filler material\\, and doesn't add to the story\\, or makes little sense.  The cool scenes\\, are defeated immediately after by logic or plot .  The porgs were cute\\, but shoved down your throat. A lot of this movie could have been better with large amount of minor tweaks\\, but it is too late now. Still better than the phantom menace. Also where is Lando?\\n\\nThe ugly- A very  iconic character is killed off non nonchalantly\\, in an uninteresting way. And no one seems to care. This was likely due the actors real life passing\\, but it should have been handled much better.\\n\\nLots of characters are killed off\\,both new and old\\,  in meaningless\\, boring\\, irreverent ways\\, with out much point. It seems like a waste of potential.\\n\\nOverall-  This movie is worth seeing\\, once it hits Redbox or a Streaming service\\, but not worth buying or seeing in theaters. It had la large amount of potential\\, but did not live up to it. Something just isn't quite right about it. It was ragingly mediocre. It felt very Disney\\, and kid friendly\\, and it is hard to tell if that is the redeeming qualities of this film\\, or the damning ones. \\n\\nPS- Chad Vader brought more to Stars Wars.","true":true}
