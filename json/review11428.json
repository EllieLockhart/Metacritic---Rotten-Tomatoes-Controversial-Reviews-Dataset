Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. Just horrible. No consistent story line\\, no coherency. Whenever we get a talentless moron who believes himself to be a revolutionary artist about to come out we pretty much always end up with a disaster outcome. Now give such a moron a huge budget and all the power of a company like Disney and a franchise as popular and well known as Star Wars and the disaster gets worse many fold. Case in point\\, Rian Johnson and the mess that is The Last Jedi. \\nHe messed up Looper back in the day but nothing comes close to this pile of garbage we got with The Last Jedi. Pffff.","true":true}
