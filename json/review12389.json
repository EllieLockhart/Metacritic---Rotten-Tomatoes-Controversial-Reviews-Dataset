Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I believe that this movie had so much potential\\, but they just fell short. The first half of the movie was nearly irrelevant\\, there was far too much comedy\\, there was no sense of time-lapse\\, plenty of characters died who didn't need to\\, plenty of characters didn't die when they should have\\, far too many 'as the plot demands it' moments.. I don't know\\, it's very hard to give a well represented review while not revealing anything. I did not leave the movie blown away\\, I did not leave absolutely livid\\, I was just fairly disappointed. ","true":true}
