Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly these are getting so bad that I've decided the next release of a Star Wars movie I'll wait for rental.  This was a first\\, trust me.  There were two seperate times I actually wanted to walk out of the movie.  For the record I am a child of the 80's and grew up on these cherished stories.  They shaped a large part of my childhood.  That said I'm open to an \\\"update\\\" of the franchise\\, but this is beyond any look and feel of what I'm use to.  Out of the gate it was odd and felt a bit strange.  The humor was something I feel was geared more to millennials.  The kind of cheeky elbow jabbing Robot Chicken slapstick humor.  While I love all those they feel really out of place in a Star Wars story.  On a few occasions I got caught staring down a fellow moviegoer with the same confused gaze.  It was as if they too couldn't understand what it was they were watching.  \\n\\nI'm really\\, really just disappointed on where the franchise is going.  I only see it getting worse than better.  Oh well\\, I loved Rogue One!","true":true}
