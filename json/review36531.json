Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie fails to draw in its audience. The beginning is slow and culminates to a battle scene that in all respect should have been the start of the movie. \\nThe cuts back and forth to different characters and times leave the audience craving story development but only delivers short lulls between action scenes.","true":true}
