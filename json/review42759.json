Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this Movie was horrible\\, Rian Johnson is an idiot\\, and has no idea what Stars Wars is in the movies\\, and to the fans! Seriously worst movie of the franchise ever I hope Johnson never has anything to do with Star Wars again!!!!!!","true":true}
