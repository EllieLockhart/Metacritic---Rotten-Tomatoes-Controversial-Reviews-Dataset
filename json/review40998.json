Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie does to the Star Wars franchise what Yoda does to the whispering tree: burn it down and start over. For that reason\\, it's a good movie\\, (Well directed and acted) but a bad Star Wars episode. For Star Wars fans and those who'd like to see storylines carried forward and mystery handled gently\\, you may be very disappointed.","true":true}
