Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't begin to express my disappointment with TLJ.  It could possibly be one of the worst movies I've seen in the last 20 years in any genre.  I'm not joking it's P9 From Outer Space\\, Battlefield Earth\\, Mac and Me bad.  The sequel did not answer any questions brought up from TFA and character development was non-existent.  I feel this movie was meant for money and propaganda purposes only such as feminism\/racial diversity.  It was shoved into my face forcefully like I'm supposed to be impressed.  There was no instance in any scene I was lost in the SW lore (besides Yoda and Luke together)\\, it was just unfunny jokes and pointless plots one after another.  The Finn and Rose romance is one of the most forced romances I've ever seen on screen\\, it will make you cringe and leave the theater.  In the prequels at least Lucas tried to make it a space opera but fell flat on execution.  Bottom line Disney\\, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson ruined the allure of Star Wars and made Mark Hamill and the original cast completely irrelevant.  All SW fans want is good storytelling\\, acting and the rest will fall into place.  I'm just glad I was given a free rental to watch this garbage.  I know for sure I'm not paying money to watch Ep. IX\\, I guarantee it.","true":true}
