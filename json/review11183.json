Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly\\, and maybe I'm just old\\, but after seeing this movie my reaction was just \\\"meh.\\\" It is not even close to being a great Star Wars movie\\, has far too many plot holes\\, etc... Was it ok? Yes. But it made me like The Force Awakens even more and appreciate that Star Wars history was respected in the prequels. \\n\\nAgain\\, I'm old (51)\\, so I get that I may just be yelling at a cloud.","true":true}
