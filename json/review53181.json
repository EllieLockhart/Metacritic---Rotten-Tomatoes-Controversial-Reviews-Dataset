Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Beautiful visuals and a fun ride with a talented cast. The story on the other hand jumped around\\, and some of the more interesting characters were surprisingly cut off. Quite drastic and uninteresting compared to Edwards and Abrams story of Star Wars. Why go for humor similar to that of Marvel? This is Star Wars and deserves much more character development and background. What is Star Wars without a decent light saber duel?","true":true}
