Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm a lifelong fan of Star Wars (literally lifelong)\\, but this was a severe disappointment. Action scenes were good\\, however there were some major plot and story problems. Some huge continuity issues with the last episode and too many throw away characters (big throw away characters\\, not even the minor ones).\\n\\nI'm so upset that I even have to give this movie a bad review\\, I'm upset that I've been driven to be this conflicted over a franchise which I love so much. I'm just so disappointed with how the movie just felt so haphazardly  thrown together\\, in regards to the story's development.","true":true}
