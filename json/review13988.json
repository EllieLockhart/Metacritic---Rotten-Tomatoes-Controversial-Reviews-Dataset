Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you have no expectations going in to this film you will have an enjoyable experience full of stunning visuals and cheap laughs. You will walk away feeling like you just watched a fun new take on a timeless classic that kept you guessing at every turn and left you wondering what's next. If you're like me and you have expectations going in you will be sorely disappointed. The story is garbage. I walked away feeling less like I watched a Star Wars movie and more like I watched two girls one cup set in space. I may have to stop off at the drug store and pick up some Pink Eye relief after exposing my eyes to that much crap.","true":true}
