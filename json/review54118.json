Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think I have ever been as disappointed in a film as I was when leaving the cinema after seeing The Last Jedi.\\n\\nThe Pros\\n\\n-Kylo Ren was a genuinely interesting character and the actor did a great job in portraying his battle between the dark and the light.\\n\\n-Carrie Fisher delivers a brilliant performance.\\n\\n-One or two moments when the film manages to recreate the magic of Star Wars\\n\\nThe cons\\n\\n-Many boring characters that serve no purpose to the plot.\\n\\n-Complete disregard to the universe and rules established by previous movies.\\n\\n-Plot lines that end up being inconsequential to story.\\n\\n-The art direction and cinematography moves away from any other star wars film.\\n\\n-The humor is very \\\"marvel like\\\" every character has to have several one liners that take away from the seriousness of the story.\\n\\n-Unlike any other star wars movie.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIf you are a fan of The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy then you might enjoy this film\\, however if you are looking for a good Star Wars movie then I'm afraid that \\\"This isn't the film you're looking for\\\"","true":true}
