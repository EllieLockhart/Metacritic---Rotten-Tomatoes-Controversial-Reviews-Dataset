Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It continues to shock me that so many movie-goers don't see the incredible story-telling that went into The Last Jedi\\, but after some thinking I think I understand the root of the vitriol. Star Wars is a big series-it goes without saying but deserves reiterating-and over its long life has acquired a very specific image which many fans cling to. It's a large-scale space opera\\, full of the struggle between good and evil\\, light and dark\\, and a plethora of other elevated themes which give it a heightened air. It sits atop a special pedestal for many fans\\, who don't particularly like when anything comes along which rocks that pedestal.\\n\\nBut TLJ has rocked it with some incredibly simple concepts which drive home powerful messages\\, and fans aren't having it. Which is a shame\\, because they're messages which are sorely needed today\\, and especially in this franchise. Spoilers ahead.\\n\\nThe first is the basic idea that Star Wars\\, its story\\, and its characters are for everyone. We've seen backlash to the changes following this concept already in the racists crawling out of the woodworks to slam John Boyega and his dark-skinned Stormtrooper Finn\\, and now spewing hate at actress Kelly Marie Tran and her character Rose Tico\\, the first visibly Asian character in SW. We saw it in the gatekeepers decrying the choice of Rey as the series' new Jedi character\\, throwing out terms like \\\"Mary Sue\\\" for her highly developed piloting abilities and her immense strength with the Force\\, yet missing the irony of not applying such labels to their heroes Anakin and Luke.\\n\\nThe idea that SW is for everyone feels threatening to the gatekeepers in the fandom\\, and so they lash out at TLJ for how much further it takes this notion than The Force Awakens did before it. Not just in introducing Rose\\, but in giving us a number of startling (and occasionally long overdue) firsts\\, like palpable visual evidence of General Leia Organa using the Force. Although it has been canon since the original trilogy that Leia is as Force-sensitive as her twin brother Luke\\, and the Expanded Universe has given us multiple stories in which Leia goes full Jedi\\, many fans balked at actually seeing the princess-turned-general use the Force to save her life. By the looks of it\\, the reasoning against this seems to be \\\"it was out of character\\\" or \\\"unrealistic\\\"\\, an odd line of thinking given the amazing feats other Force-users have been able to accomplish. Why should Leia be any different\\, particularly when she's had 30 years in which to experiment with her abilities? We don't see those 30 years\\, so we don't really know how far she might have pushed learning to use the Force tangibly. There's nothing particularly unrealistic about it.\\n\\nThe other thing people don't seem to be agreeing with is TLJ's bold statement that the Force does not belong to the Jedi. Even after six movies\\, many fans still don't seem to be able to reckon with the notion that the Jedi and their counterpart\\, the Sith\\, were in many ways equally detrimental to the balance of the Force. The Sith took their passion and lust for power to extremes\\, while the Jedi's emotional detachment and adherence to faith in the Force proved too passive and constricting\\, resulting in their downfall. The new generation of characters and movies opens the path for the Force to truly be put into balance-no more Jedi\\, no more Sith\\, just people learning to use their abilities in harmony. But with our heroine Rey revealed to be refreshingly unrelated to anyone else in the series\\, many fans feel cheated by how open this leave the narrative. Unfortunate\\, considering that fresh characters and new stories are what keeps Star Wars afloat.\\n\\nIt bears mentioning\\, too\\, that opening SW up to all audiences in TLJ meant some particular story-telling devices and humor which fans felt landed flat. I\\, for one\\, enjoyed the humor which was injected into TLJ particularly because it chipped away at the lofty pedestal on which fans have ensconced the series. Star Wars is first and foremost about people in all their awkwardness and hilarity\\, and for those fans who say that humor has no place in SW\\, I would simply point back to this moment between Luke and Han on Tatooine in Return of the Jedi:\\n\\nHan: \\\"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur\\, I see a big light blur.\\\"\\nLuke: \\\"There's nothing to see. I used to live here\\, you know.\\\"\\nHan: \\\"You're going to die here\\, you know. Convenient.\\\"\\n\\nFinally\\, one of the most important messages of TLJ which fans are rejecting is one which was summarized best by the surprise appearance of Yoda in Force-ghost form. As Luke struggles to come to terms with his past mistakes and how they're shaping the future\\, Yoda gives him some sound advice: \\\"The greatest teacher\\, failure is.\\\"\\n\\nFailure is a thread which runs heavy throughout TLJ\\, and it's not something audiences are used to having to worry about so deeply. As a collective\\, and particularly where Star Wars is concerned\\, we expect that things are going to work out. More than that\\, we expect to be in the know on every little piece of narrative so that we can brace ourselves for potential failures and be ready to cheer when the heroes triumph.\\n\\nBut TLJ does not give us that omniscience\\, and for many\\, that's enough to be a movie ruiner instead of a game changer. From the start\\, we watch our new favorite flying ace Poe Dameron brush failure as his rash actions lead to the deaths of countless rebels. When he's held accountable\\, we feel for him\\, because his idea of success includes the option of going down in a blaze of glory. That's an ideal for him\\, and as audiences it's an idea we've been conditioned to applaud\\, even when reality shows that that is not always the best route. So we feel for Poe because we agree with him\\, but TLJ smacks us as sharply as Leia smacks Poe and reminds us that living to keep those you're fighting for safe is far more effective than dying a hero and being unable to protect them.\\n\\nWe see failure taken further still. We're fully on board with Poe and his mutiny as the story progresses\\, because Admiral Holdo and the narrative are holding their plans captive from Poe and us. We don't like being kept in the dark as an audience; we're conditioned to feel as though this means the one withholding plans is naturally in the wrong. So watching Poe's mutiny tank\\, learning that his plans and those of Finn and Rose have all been for naught\\, is a crushing blow. But most audiences appear to be taking this as a personal slight rather than as a learning moment. We should always be skeptical of authority figures\\, and blindly following orders is more often harmful than helpful\\, but as TLJ shows us here\\, there are also times when acting without all the facts or thought for the consequences can be just as deadly. It feels like a waste of time to some\\, watching Finn and Rose have an adventure in a space casino only to have it all be for nothing\\, but Yoda's words ring out true here too: failure is the most powerful teacher\\, and our heroes prove their mettle by bouncing back from said failures and giving their all to winning the day.\\n\\nFinally\\, for those who took the greatest issue with Luke's character arc in TLJ\\, there is some comfort to be had in again looking back to the original trilogy. Luke Skywalker has always been a relatable hero because he's the boy from nowhere. He lead an unimportant life on Tatooine and dreamed of greater things. Suddenly\\, fortune (or the Force) brought him into the greater story of the galaxy\\, and it turned out that he was actually someone of great importance. As a good hero does\\, he rose to the occasion\\, but as any human person does\\, he met setbacks and struggled with doubt. Throughout the first trilogy\\, doubt was Luke's greatest enemy\\, particularly self-doubt. He seemed to have conquered it by the climax of RotJ\\, but remember that there are 30 years between then and TFA which we only have had glimpses of. Old insecurities don't die easily\\, and it's easy to see how they could have come crawling back to haunt Luke as hard as they did. A lone man trying to rebuild the entire Jedi Order on his own when he had only a partial training himself? That's a lot of pressure\\, even for someone who almost single-handedly took down the Galactic Empire\\, destroyed the Emperor\\, and redeemed his father. Under such pressure\\, it's hard to expect anyone\\, even a hero\\, to remain perfectly confident. So when confronted with the raw power of his nephew\\, how can we blame him for being terrified and reacting badly?\\n\\nWhat is most important about Luke which is made clear in TLJ is that he is our hero not because of his weaknesses\\, but because he always overcomes them. He stops himself from killing his nephew in instinct\\, and although timing and fate still deliver a sad outcome\\, there's a lot to be said for his restraint and repulsion at his own doubts in Ben. After being in hiding for years\\, he steps in and saves the day on Crait to allow the Rebellion another chance at life\\, at carrying on the fight. And most of all\\, as sad as it is to watch him go\\, he becomes one with the Force at peace\\, having finally learned to reconcile his doubt with his faith\\, his insecurities with his sense of right and wrong. And it's all the more touching a moment for it.\\n\\nAll in all\\, The Last Jedi is a challenge which most viewers seem only to take at face value\\, rejecting the offered opportunity for expanding our idea of what heroes look like\\, how they behave\\, what they overcome\\, and what their stories look like. All these ideas are wrapped in an exciting Star Wars adventure which is full of the incredible visuals and battles we've come to expect\\, but without that expected feel-good pat on the head and assurance that everything will be alright just as it always has been. Because that's not the point of The Last Jedi. Everything will indeed be alright\\, but nothing is ever the same as it was before\\, and that's all for the better. Change is hard\\, but eventually\\, we learn to see how much better off we are for it. I am thrilled to see Star Wars take leaps and bounds into new directions and explore every corner of humanity and our potential. One can only hope that others will learn to see this progress for the good in it\\, as well.","true":true}
