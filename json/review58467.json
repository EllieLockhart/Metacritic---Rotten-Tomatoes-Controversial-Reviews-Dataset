Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Almost every plot point in this movie is mind-numblingly lazy. The actions and handling of Luke Skywalker are\\, in a few instances\\, simply disrespectful to the films. Rian and whoever else contributed to the story just didn't know whoa they were doing. The humor is nothing but an ill-timed cringe-fest\\, and the central plot feels like it was ripped from the pages of an average Star Trek Voyager script. Also\\, it is absolutely unbelievable that the First zorder is so dominating the Rebellion when they are perhaps the most incompetent fictional military ever imagined. Another thing\\, most of the scenes of this film are just cobbled scenes from all the other movies with different characters. While the Mepire Strikes Back was building a story\\, The Last Jedi utterly deflates any hope of story. There are no heroes in this film\\, every character is poorl developed. Laura Dern shouldn't be in this movie\\, either. This isn't half of the problems with the movie. Lazy\\, awful\\, disrespectful\\, mess","true":true}
