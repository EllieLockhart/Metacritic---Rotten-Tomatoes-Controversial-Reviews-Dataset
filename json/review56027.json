Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Six family members have now seen this movie\\, and all six of us feel the same way. Character development?  Didn't happen.  Intriguing plot?   Having the good guys running away from the bad guys (and being low on fuel) just didn't cut it.  Thematically?  This was the most annoying aspect of all.  Star Wars is about good\\, evil\\, destiny\\, sacrifice and heroism.  It turned Luke Skywalker into a self centered\\, cranky old guy.  Poe got called silly names like \\\"Flyboy\\,\\\" and Finn had the same arc as in the prior movie. \\n\\n All six of us hated this movie.  There won't be any repeat theater visits as in movies past\\, nor will anyone be buying Star Wars toys and t-shirts.  \\n\\nWorst scene -- Carrie Fischer flying through space like Tinkerbell.  \\n\\nBest scene:  The cute little critters that looked like penguins. \\n\\nNext Best Scene: The closing credit. \\n\\nP.S.  Maybe it's just me\\, but the music was obtrusive--maybe to cover up the lack of meaningful dialogue. \\n\\nOh well.","true":true}
