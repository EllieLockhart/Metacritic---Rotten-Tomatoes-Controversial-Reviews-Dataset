Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There are many movies that could have been so much better if only they allowed a longer run time\\, movies that I would have loved to sit still for for 3 hours or more. \\nThis movie did not need the extra time to tell the story\\, and I did not enjoy sitting still for 2 1\/2 hrs to get to see it unfold. The main characters seem actually less compelling than in the last movie\\, as they: Turn Poe into an misogynistic ass-hat in order to make the slow-chase less boring\\, give Finn \\\"something to do\\\" with a new character because his part in the story was over before the last movie ended\\, and struggle to keep us interested in two lack-luster foils. I've tried but I just can't genuinely care about what happens to these characters the way I could for episodes 4-6.","true":true}
