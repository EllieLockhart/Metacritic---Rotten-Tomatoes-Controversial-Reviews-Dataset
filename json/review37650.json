Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There\u2019s a good Star Wars movie in here but it\u2019s not what we got. Feels like a Marvel movie (the ones that are quip fests); coming from someone who actually enjoys the Marvel movies\\, it\u2019s not what I want out of Star Wars.","true":true}
