Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only reason I signed up for this site is to let everyone who works hard for their money know that this is probably the most mind numbing movie I've seen.  I'm sorry for Luke's character and for all of the old people in the world.  Obviously this is a movie to let generations know that old people need not apply.  The diversity in actors replaces diversity in new creatures. As a star wars original fan\\, I would have liked to have seen both.  IF you are still curious\\, wait to rent it.  Save your time and your money!","true":true}
