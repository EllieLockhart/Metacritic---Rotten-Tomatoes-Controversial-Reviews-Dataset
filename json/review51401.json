Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute trash. Terrible terrible story and even worse execution. Every \\\"twist\\\" was the second most obvious thing and rarely ever made sense. Completely destroyed the canon\\, whoever wrote this has no idea what Star Wars is. I am going to go watch Return of the Jedi because I want my Luke Skywalker back.","true":true}
