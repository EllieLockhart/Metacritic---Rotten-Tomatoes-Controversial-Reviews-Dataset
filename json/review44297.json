Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too many forced comedy scenes that undermine the villain's role. None of the questions raised in Force Awakens were answered here which means we waited for nothing. Luke is a much different character and his character portrayal is wrong. Overall\\, this movie was a huge letdown and the 2 year wait did not pay off. Hoping JJ Abrams saves what is left of the new trilogy.","true":true}
