Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand where all the die hard Star Wars fans who hated this movie are coming from\\, but also I see what Disney is trying to do. Most people are upset at this film because it \u201cdidn\u2019t meet their expectations\u201d; however\\, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame Disney for that. You are the ones who developed those expectations\\, and honestly shouldn\u2019t you be glad all the things you expected didn\u2019t happen because then wouldn\u2019t the movie have just been boring? Disney is trying to reconstruct Star Wars and that\u2019s why all these things happened in the film that you weren\u2019t expecting. They don\u2019t want you to expect it. Yes\\, Disney hyped up a lot of stuff and then the answers were kind of lame but they did it on purpose. They wanted the fans to come up with theories and everything so that they could make something happen that no one was expecting. They\u2019re trying to make this trilogy different from the original trilogy so no Snoke is not going to be the next Emperor because that would just be dumb and predictable. And although I didn\u2019t necessarily love how Luke was portrayed in this film I understand why Disney made him that way. They\u2019re trying to distance themselves from the originals and get rid of the old characters that we all love. It\u2019s sad to see them go but it is necessary if we want Star Wars to continue. Finally\\, I\u2019m giving this movie a 5 star rating because I love Star Wars\\, and I\u2019m not just going to give it a half star because I wasn\u2019t expecting everything that happened. Overall\\, I loved the movie and I can\u2019t wait to see what Episode IX has in store because I\u2019ll bet that no one will be expecting it.","true":true}
