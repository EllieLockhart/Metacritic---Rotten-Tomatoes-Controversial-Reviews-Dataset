Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of the movies plot made no sense. There was an entire approximately hour long scene that was a complete waste of time in the end.\\nIf Poe is one of the high commanders and best pilot\\, you would tell your high ranking officer the plan. That makes no sense not too\\, only for the writers to make the long and useless plot that wasted half the movie with. \\n\\nThe character development and the plot fell flat. I was hugely disappointed in an entirety. \\nEvery build up The Force Awakens build up\\, this movie destroyed. \\nAnd then the one scene that was incredible cringe. Flying through space. You all know the scene. That was just. Bad. ","true":true}
