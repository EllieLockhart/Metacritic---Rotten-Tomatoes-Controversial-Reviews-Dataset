Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So disappointing. Great acting\\, acting that saves much of the movie\\, but a plot that thinks it's smart but is actually so very stupid. Don't even get me started on the foundation of the action throughout most of the film which is a dozen ships with fast than light speed cannot catch up to one\\, lone ship because it's smaller and lighter (are they in a special gravity zone of space we've not heard of yet? One of the Star Destroyers couldn't zip ahead via light speed\\, turn around and go\\, \\\"Ah ha!\\\". Or how about if the fighters that had just destroyed the entire command staff of the Resistance\/Rebellion... what if they'd just kept attacking? They'd already destroyed all the X-wings\\, who was going to stop them?). Worse yet is the idea that this film does away with the old and brings in the better new. Away with the dashing heroes who risked it all\\, who went off half-cocked.. Thousand of years of Jedi order? Terrible. Burn it all down and start from absolute scratch. But what truly wrecked this for me was a great Mark Hamill given so very little to do. He stomps around on an island\\, Grumpy Old Jedi style\\, then has a moment at the end that's not really a  moment. What a waste. The only truly good thing about this movie is that it's nowhere near as good as the reviews\\, so the fact that JJ is writing and directing the next one is not nearly as big a let down as I'd initially thought.","true":true}
