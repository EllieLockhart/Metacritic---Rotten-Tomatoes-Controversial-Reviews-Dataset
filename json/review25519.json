Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No spoilers. It is not worth seeing in theaters. The plot was thin\\, and it did not make sense half the time. With the being said\\, there are a few scenes that are decent\\, but overall I am not impressed. I urge Disney to hire a different movie director for the next movie.","true":true}
