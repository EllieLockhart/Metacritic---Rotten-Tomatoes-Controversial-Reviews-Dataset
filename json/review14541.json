Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have a few issues or things that I would\u2019ve liked to seen different about The Last Jedi\\, but overall I enjoyed it very much. Looking forward to seeing it again.","true":true}
