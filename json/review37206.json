Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The only word I can use to describe this film is pathetic. Being a life-long Star Wars fan\\, it was disappointing to see such a gross disregard for the prequels (including \\\"The Force Awakens\\\").  The odd slapstick humor was cringe-worthy. The plot was jerky\\, hard to follow\\, preachy\\, boring\\, and left new characters severely underdeveloped.","true":true}
