Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A total travesty on the handling of the main characters! If only Disney had listened to George Lucas! This will be the only Star Wars movie that I'll watch only once! All that build up for nothing. Plot holes as big as the Grand Canyon! What's with all the hate on the male characters also?! The only thing worse than watching Luke milk an alien is watching Disney milk the Star Wars franchise for everything it's worth!! Very disappointed. Shame on you Disney for destroying my childhood and a beloved franchise!","true":true}
