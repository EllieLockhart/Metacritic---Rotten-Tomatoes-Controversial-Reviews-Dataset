The feeling of bitterness and also love follows you till you finish it. Then it lefts you there alone. Despite all the mithical atmosphere you play in\\, all the good fight mechanics and swiftness of animations\\, all the risky yet brave plot\\, all the effort to bring the answers we all asked after playing the first game; there were some weaknesses. Some of the highly impactful and effective characters we see in the story are incomplete and wasted of their potential. The world emerges and expands much much bigger than the first game but it causes to lose the strands that ties the story at some parts. The acting is unshakably strong and polished thanks to the brilliant developers\\, the precious Ashley Johnson\\, Troy Baker\\, Laura Bailey\\, all the executives and the director and co-writer of the game; Neil Druckmann and all the team made this possible working at Naughty Dog. There are space to criticise and sincere thanks for everyone who is considerate and open hearted.  I wish you keep making great games further.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
