Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"TLJ suffers because its main character is as interesting as a wet paper towel.  The plot is poorly conceived with a needless detour that extends the viewer's suffering.  Unlike most fans\\, I approved of Luke's role\\, but the movie didn't earn the viewer's trust because it was too busy going through the motions with shallow characters.","true":true}
