Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars movie ever. The entire scene where Fin goes to the casino to save the racehorses was a complete waste of time. Purple-hair-lady-general refusing to tell Poe the plan made zero sense. And\\, worst of all\\, they destroyed Like as a character. I could go on\\, but this short tirade covers a few of the major problems. Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
