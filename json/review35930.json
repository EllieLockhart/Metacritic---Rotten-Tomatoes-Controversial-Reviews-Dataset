Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is unpredictable. Rian Johnson makes ballsy moves with this film. Some of these choices deliver and satisfy\\, some don't and raise questions and conflict. Nevertheless\\, the cast gives strong perfrormances in their roles (though I did not like Benecio del Toro's performance). Everyone involved gives 110% and it clearly shows. Despite some pacing issues\\, The Last Jedi is entertaining as hell. Rian Johnson makes his mark on Star Wars history.","true":true}
