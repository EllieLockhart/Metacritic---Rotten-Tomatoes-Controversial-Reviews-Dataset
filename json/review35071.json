Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first Star Wars movie that I did not see on opening night since Return of the Jedi. This did not even feel like a Star Wars movie. The only thing that could have made this worse is if Jar-Jar Binks showed up.","true":true}
