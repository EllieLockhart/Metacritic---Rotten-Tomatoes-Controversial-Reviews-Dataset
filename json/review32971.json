Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Storyline was disjointed.  Left many things not explained. All the trials and tribulations to be trained by a master jedi and Rey just picks it up with hardly talking to Luke.  Had high hopes for this trilogy.  I don't think it can recover.  At this point\\, the episodes 1-3 might be about as good as these.  Those got better as they went along.  I think the spinoff movies might just be better this time around.","true":true}
