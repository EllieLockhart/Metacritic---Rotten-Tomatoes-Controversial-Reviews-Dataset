Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like many others made an account specifically to leave my opinion about this abomination of a film. This won't be a long review as there are many others already here which go into detail about this travesty. I love Star Wars more so than any other film or television series I have ever seen\\, it is something that has actually influenced my life and contributed to the nature of my character and personality. The Last Jedi was a disgrace and a total and utter betrayal of everything Star Wars. It made absolutely no sense in keeping with the lore and themes of what this beautiful franchise was built on. Congratulations to the egotisical Kathleen Kennedy and her protege Rian Johnson for destroying something which meant so much more to the fandom than just a series of movies - a spectacular artwork which brought together and connected so many people. This theatrical opera has now turned into a divisive means of social propaganda\\, contaminated with feministic and political ideologies. I will be actively boycotting anything Lucasfilm and furthermore Disney until both Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson are fired. I will not contribute to the downfall of this which I hold so dear anymore. Force and peace be with you people (the exception of Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson).","true":true}
