Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is extremely wrong and has too many sub plots and the worst of the worst character development. \\n\\nYou get on the edge of your seat and boom nothing happens. Disney continues to disappoint but as does Star Wars. \\n\\nAlso don\u0092t worry about spoilers because literally nothing happens. The biggest mystery\u0092s nothing\\, everything in this movie is nothing. I spent almost 3 hours and $30 to be disappointed.","true":true}
