Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some really fun scenes\\, but so sad to say I was disappointed. It took what could have been epic\\, unforgettable moments (Luke training Rey\\, discovering who Snoke is\\, Discovering Rey's secret background etc.) and made them meaningless and boring and pumped up the needless plot points instead. All while adding anti-star wars humor throughout that just took me out of the movie.","true":true}
