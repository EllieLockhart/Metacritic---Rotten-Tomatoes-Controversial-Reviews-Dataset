Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I expect more. The director added some humor\\, that wasn\u2019t before. Maybe for the new fans. And some scenes were boring and did not fit to the franchise.","true":true}
