Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Meh\\, it wasn't terrible. But it certainly wasn't good. I have had a lot of time to think about it since the movie came out. It's a shame JJ Abrams didn't direct this one\\, he probably would have done a lot better. Good visuals\\, I guess. Great CJI. However\\, special effects don't save this movie from its lack of coherency\\, plot holes\\, and\\, I am exaggerating\\, character destruction. I think the most disappointing thing about this move was their treatment of Luke. The character we all used to love was just a depressed former hero in this movie. I would've been okay with that if he had a redemption arc later on at the end\\, where his depression went away and he became the person he once was. Unfortunately\\, that didn't happen. All he did was troll Kylo Ren\\, and then commit force suicide. I really hope he's revealed alive in the Rise of Skywalker (maybe the name says something) and gets better treatment. Even Mark Hamill was clearly upset with how his character was treated in this movie. Overall I don't think this movie is as bad as most haters say it is\\, but it's still moderately bad. I've put my faith in JJ Abrams to fix Rian Johnson's mistake here with the Rise of Skywalker\\, but who knows if JJ can successfully reunite the fanbase and explain away the broken mess that was this movie.","true":true}
