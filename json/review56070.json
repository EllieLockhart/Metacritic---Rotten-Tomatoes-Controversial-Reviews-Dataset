Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many plot holes.  Poe is to blame for the destruction of the resistance.  Because of him all resistance bombers are destroyed\\, sends Fin and Rose on a catastrophic side mission which results in betrayal from code breaker CJ.  CJ tells the first oder how to track Leia and about the transports escaping to a secret base.  How CJ got this info\\, still does not make sense.  By the end of the film the resistance is dead (over 400 killed)\\, they have no allies (no one came)\\, and Luke killed himself.  WTF!!!  Thanks Rain\\, what a S-Storm.  Good luck to the righter of episode 9\\, I have no idea how they are going to clean up this mess.  And how the hell did a Map to Luke even exists if he did not send it.  He did not want to be found!!!  Also the reveal that Rey is from nobody\\, Snok is killed to easy\\, Phasa is a push over\\, and Rey is a Jedi some how with no training.  The story teaches us nothing\\, has little to no tie into the force awakens\\, and does nothing to move the larger plot points along.  In actuality key plot points were abandoned\\, tie to Vader\\, the Skywalker legacy\\, the Jedi order\\, the awakening\\, ect.  \\\"The Past must Die\\, kill it if you have to.\\\"  Wow way to take a big steaming dump on the franchise.  This would have been better as a stand alone film or one part in a much longer series.  Does not work as the 2nd movie in a 3 part series.  Good luck JJ on 9\\, your going to need it.","true":true}
