Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Moral of the Story- Men are stupid and bad and failures in every way even you childhood hero's\\, women are great and amazing and are secretly right about everything even when you can't see it. This is the movie that killed Star Wars.","true":true}
