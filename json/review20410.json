Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I understand why everyone hates this movie. It wasnt what you expected. You assumed all your questions would be answered and you assumed wrong. Rian Johnson said fuck you and did his own thing. And to be honest thats awesome because everyone had their theories on who Rey's parents were and who Snoke really was and it turns out no one is anyone. SURPRISE you were all wrong. Star wars is no longer a Skywalker movie. The old are dying off and new people are continuing the fight. Johnson made a really good movie and if it was its own thing and not part of a franchise everyone would love it and hopefully they still let Rian make his own side star wars trilogy apart from the original storyline kinda like this movie kinda turned out to be. So all in all JJ Abrams shouldve been in charge of this entire trilogy and Rian Johnson should've just did his own trilogy unfortunately we had to see what he could do before we could see what he will do. I think the last jedi was really good but it wouldve been better if it wasnt about Luke and friends","true":true}
