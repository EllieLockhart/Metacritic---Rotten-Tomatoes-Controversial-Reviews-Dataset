Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Why?  Why was this movie made\\, why did no one come in and stop the director.  It just defies all logic.  From the very beginning\\, this movie was doomed. I really don't think the director has ever seen a Star Wars movie before.","true":true}
