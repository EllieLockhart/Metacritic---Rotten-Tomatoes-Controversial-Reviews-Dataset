Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Good:  FX and space battles.  It feels like the Star Wars universe.  \\nThe Bad:  I hate how all the original trilogy's heros have been treated in these last 2 movies.  I'm not sold on Kylo Ren as the \\\"Big Bad\\\".  Snoke being a paper tiger\\, and much ado about nothing.  Yoda bringing the lightning a la Thor from beyond the grave.  Jake Skywalker because that Can Not Be LUKE!   Honestly\\, in this day and age of reboots\\, This movie proves that the last two in this series both need to be rebooted.","true":true}
