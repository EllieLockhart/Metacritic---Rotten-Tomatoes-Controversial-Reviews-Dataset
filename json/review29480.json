Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has taken a franchise that would draw movie-goers no matter who was directing\\, and proved that it would have indeed been better if they had recruited someone from the street outside the studio to direct. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a troubled movie full of absolutely wasted characters and completely unneccesary plot lines. Many otherwise good characters that were well-developed in The Force Awakens were reduced to punchlines. A Star Wars FLOP. J.J. Abrams now has to spend the last movie in this trilogy cleaning up Johnson's mess.","true":true}
