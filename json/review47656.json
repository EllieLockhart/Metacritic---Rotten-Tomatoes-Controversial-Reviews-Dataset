Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When a movie is made the director has a first cut\\, then he cuts out all the stuff that does not move the plot forward\\, or are just fluff and unnecessary. It's like he did that but then got confused because the movie was only 15 minutes long\\, so he just made a move from the deleted scenes.\\n\\nAlmost everything that went on in this movie was pointless to the plot\\, which was The rebels are almost wiped out and need to survive\\, and escape.","true":true}
