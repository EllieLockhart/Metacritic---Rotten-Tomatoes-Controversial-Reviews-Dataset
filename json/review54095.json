Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't hate it\\, but I'm disappointed. Rian Johnson took everything JJ built up in Force Awakens\\, and essentially ruined it. He took Luke Skywalker\\, one of the most iconic characters in the history of cinema\\, and turned him into an angry\\, bitter\\, brooding old man\\, who just wants to hide away on an island\\, feel sorry for himself\\, and die. Then\\, at the end\\, he's just winked out of existence. Mark Hamill's objections to RJ's vision of Luke were well founded\\, and 100% correct.\\n\\nSnoke\\, the new evil force in the universe\\, turned out to be a complete wimp. How he went down so easily\\, without a fight\\, is beyond me. He turned out to be nothing more than a filler character. Fodder to advance Kylo Ren's story.\\n\\nCaptain Phasma\\, another bad ass character from JJ\\, dead. RJ didn't even try to develop her. Complete waste. She could have been big. (Rey's mother maybe?)\\n\\nI loved Rey in TFA. Didn't care much about her in TLJ. Lost interest half way through. The whole build-up to \\\"who are Rey's parents?\\\" flopped. Massive disappointment.\\n\\nAmilyn Holdo. I like her. Could have been better. Another possible choice for Rey's mother.\\n\\nRose. Pointless\\, filler character. Served absolutely no purpose. I don't buy the whole \\\"I love you fin\\\" moment. Pathetic attempt at a love story.\\n\\nWhile Leia floated in space\\, all I could think of was Neo from the Matrix. This was just cheesy non-sense.\\n\\nI was so disappointed in this movie\\, that I didn't even feel the emotion I should have felt watching what would be Mark and Carrie's final scene together. Ever.\\n\\nThe Caisno scene derailed the story. After it was thankfully over\\, it took me a good five minutes to get back into the movie. I never completely recovered after that point.\\n\\nBenicio Del Toro's character was kinda boring. I'm surprised an actor of his caliber signed on for it.\\n\\nI know it sounds like I hated The Last Jedi. I didn't. Episodes 1\\, 2 & 3 I hated. Nothing will be worse for me than those three movies. I am just profoundly disappointed. JJ Abrams setup what should have been a home run for Rian Johnson. Instead of knocking it out of the park\\, and into the the next zip code\\, he hit a blooper\\, right back to JJ.\\n\\nI feel sorry for JJ Abrams. Luke Skywalker\\, dead. Snoke\\, dead. Phasma\\, dead. Vice-Admiral Holdo\\, dead. \\nAdmiral Ackbar\\, dead. He doesn't have much to work with anymore. Talk about having your work cut out for you.\\n\\nGood luck JJ. If anyone can pull Star Wars from the abyss\\, you can. You've done it before.","true":true}
