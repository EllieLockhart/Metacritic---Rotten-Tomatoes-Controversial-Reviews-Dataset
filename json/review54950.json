Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It sucks that this movie is getting so much hate from the \\\"fan boys\\\" \\nThis movie was a lot to take in.. but it was FANTASTIC!\\nRian Johnson changed the game\\nHe just fucked with everything we ever thought we knew and theorized for two years and thru it out the window\\nEvery scene\\, every arc \\nYou think you know where it's going ... and boom !!! \\nSurprises and shocks \\nAnd I FUCKEN LOVED IT!!!\\nHe brought into this movie old concepts from the old republic \/EU\\nAnd call backs from the original movies\\nPuppets !!!!\\nhe expanded what the force in theory can do\\nAnd it was AMAZING !!!\\nso much info \\nSo much to take in\\nWhere do we go from here? How is  JJ going to finish this ?
