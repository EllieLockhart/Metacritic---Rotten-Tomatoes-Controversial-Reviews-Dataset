Now\\, I don't mind a bit of diversity (it is probably a requirement at this point) but it all feels so forced. Characters are blatantly shallow\\, motivations have been tossed out of the window and what should have been an awesome finale to a great game feels like a gut punch from naughty dog because of reasons I will never understand. If their goal was to make an LGBTQ character we could symphatize with they have failed horribly. Instead they have given  us a token\\, a throw-away that should have been an npc-companion you would learn to appreciate during a long struggle to survive\\, not the main character of a franchise that was supposed to have a long future. A waste of potential\\, both of a diverse character\\, a strong female lead and a franchise naughty dog could have milked out for the next 2 decades.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
