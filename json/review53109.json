Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A very solid addition to the franchise. There were only a few moments that I found to be rather unnecessary and one moment\\, while awesome\\, was a bit ridiculous. Through all of it\\, however\\, I found myself realizing one major thing: I don't understand everything about the Force\\, and that's a good thing. I didn't want to understand how everything in the Force because it makes it feel magical\\, and that's what this movie does. Great action scenes\\, a couple standout moments and a major step forward into the relationship of Rey and Kylo\/Ben that makes me feel excited for whatever the final chapter of this Trilogy may bring.","true":true}
