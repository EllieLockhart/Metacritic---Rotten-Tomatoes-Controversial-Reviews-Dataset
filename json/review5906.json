Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing - I felt JJ Abraham\u2019s revived the franchise spectacularly from the damage of the prequals with Force Awakens but Rian Johnson some how made this film feel like the prequals. Some of the decisions might have seemed interesting on paper but it didn\u2019t translate to the screen. Some of the comedy spat in the face of the fan base and was out of place in this series. There are of course some omg moments but there wasn\u2019t enough of an expelenation of why or how. There was a necessary gravitas from Mark Hamills performance that was missing. This is Luke Skywalker in self banishment. A little seriousness and weight would be great. Luke just came off as an uncle who missed a few Christmas dinners.. ","true":true}
