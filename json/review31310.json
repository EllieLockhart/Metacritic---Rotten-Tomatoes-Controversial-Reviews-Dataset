Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some elements were good. Most elements didn\u2019t feel like Star Wars\\, ruined characters I loved and threw away mysteries I wanted to learn about. Overall the film was very disappointing from a fan\u2019s perspective.","true":true}
