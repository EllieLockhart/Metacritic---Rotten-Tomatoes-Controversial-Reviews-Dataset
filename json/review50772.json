Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A beautiful movie with robust character development thrown slightly off track by a mediocre and seemingly unnecessarily subplot. Nevertheless\\, the Last Jedi is a powerful followup to the Force Awakens that gives audiences what will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the most stunning scenes in the entire saga.","true":true}
