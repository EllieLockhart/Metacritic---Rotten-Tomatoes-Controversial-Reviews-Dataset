Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie I have seen and possible one of the worst movies I have seen in general. Sure\\, the effects are decent and the acting is acceptable\\, but it's the overuse of childish humor\\, the nonsensical\\, hole filled plot and the apparent disregard for many previously establish and treasured franchise elements that puts me off. This will be the only Star Wars movie I don't enjoy watching let alone finishing.","true":true}
