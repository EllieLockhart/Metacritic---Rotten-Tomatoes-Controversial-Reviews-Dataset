Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is just bad on so many levels. If Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy honestly think they can fundamentally change this franchise into some dumbed can down version and fans will remain loyal\\, they are extremely mistaken. Media belittling fans critical of the film by calling them names and labeling them as \\\"toxic\\\" isn't a good idea either. It's a good way to commit financial suicide.","true":true}
