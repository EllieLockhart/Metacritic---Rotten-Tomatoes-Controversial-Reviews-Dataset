Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok movie terrible Star Wars movie. It should be call Star Wars: let the old things die. They want us to forget how the force actually works\\, what made the original trilogy awesome\\, and not care about all the build up and questions the force awakens was leading to in the movie. If you was ready for the force awaken sequel this really isn\u2019t it. Storyline doesn\u2019t work and all important characters were botched. Other that a couple cool scenes fans of the o.g. Movies and the force awakens will be disappointed. This director did not get Star Wars had no intention of making a true sequel to JJ Abrams directed force awakens and he messed things up so bad I don\u2019t know how JJ will fix this the next movie. There should have been on director for all of it. This is a shame to have as part movie cannon.","true":true}
