Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Major Spoiler Warnings* \\n\\nThis movie really is just a big shiny centerpiece in the middle of Disney's grand buffet. With some absolutely beautiful scenes such as the destruction of The Supremacy and the gorgeous high contrast of white and red during the battle on Crait. I really wanted to be able to at least enjoy this movie trilogy as if it were its own entity and not an entry in the Star Wars universe\\, However it quickly became clear that I would not be given that satisfaction.\\n\\n Now\\, going into my gripes about the movie. The audience knows from Episode 7 that Rey seems to not really know her parents\\, and clings onto any older male character (Han Solo in Episode 7\\, and Luke Skywalker in Episode 8) as if they were the father figure she so lacked as a child. The audience was genuinely interested about who her parents were\\, whether that be Jedi\\, Sith\\, Or any other fan theory out there\\, However we are never given even the slightest amount of information on them\\, which is a massive lost opportunity to explain exactly why she has such a strong connection to the force and to Luke.\\n\\nSupreme Leader Snoke had a very strong presence in Episode 7 as well\\, and the community in general was excited to see where this supposedly all powerful bad guy would be going in terms of story telling. Did we get anything on that? No. Not a word about him. It seems like his whole role in the series is purely to provide an antagonist during the first two films before he is unceremoniously killed in the matter of a minute or two after our main protagonist meets him. He has no backstory\\, no easily distinguishable motive besides \\\"He's Evil\\\"\\, and after he is killed\\, seemingly no impact on the story going forward.\\n\\nLuke Skywalker is my biggest gripe when it comes to this movie however. Luke was an almost universally loved character in the original trilogy and rightly so in my opinion. His story arc followed \\\"The Hero's Journey\\\" style of storytelling and character development to a \\\"T\\\"\\, which isn't necessarily a bad thing mind you. However when you take all the lessons learned and character development and completely toss it away just to get a shaky plotline out of him\\, it's just lazy writing at that point.\\n\\nI won't say much on Flinn's character because I genuinely like him\\, I only don't like that the ONE main character who isn't white just happens to be the butt of all the slapstick humor in the movies\\, and I think that's a major injustice to Mr. Boyega.\\n\\nOverall I think this would have been a perfectly mediocre movie if it just didn't have the Star Wars branding on it. I really want to like Rey\\, Flinn\\, and Kylo Ren\\, but we still know so little of any of them (With a slight exception for Kylo) that I find it extraordinarily difficult to connect with any of them and truly enjoy their characters\\, no matter how good the acting is.","true":true}
