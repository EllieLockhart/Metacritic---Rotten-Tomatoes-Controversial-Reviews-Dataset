Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything George Lucas and even JJ Abrams has done with the Star Wars movies to date have been completely thrown out the window\\, which creates huge plot holes in favour of selling toys and expanded stories via comics\\, books\\, games and spin offs to fill in the gaps. The movie completely mistreats the legacy cast and stories already told in the universe\\, and doesn\u2019t answer questions from the first. Overall disappointing\\, it is clear that changing director and writer mid way through a trilogy who has a different vision was not a good idea. ","true":true}
