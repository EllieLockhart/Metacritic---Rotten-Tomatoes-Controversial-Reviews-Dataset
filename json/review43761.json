Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was the worst Star War film I have ever seen. Completely disrespectful to the Original Trilogy\\, the fans and basic common sense. Why didn't Admiral Idiot just explain to Poe what her plan was? He just successfully disabled the guns on the first order ship. It's a contrived ham-fisted way of shoving a dubious aesop down the audience's throat. Don't even get me started on what Rian Johnson did to Luke Skywalker....! Utter trash. Don't see\\, don't buy\\, don't let your brain die.","true":true}
