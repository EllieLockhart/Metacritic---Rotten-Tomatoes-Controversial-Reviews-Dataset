Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not just a very poor Star Wars film (although\\, frankly it doesn't even feel like a Star Wars film)\\, but a very poor film in general. Bad storytelling\\, inappropriate humour\\, terrible acting\\, and heroes so one-dimensional and lifeless you even want the sub-par bad guys to win.","true":true}
