Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely adored it! The time flied inside the cinema. I don't know where al this hate comes from. It is definitely better than  Episode VII TFA and far better of what I expected. The worst part is that I will have to wait again other 2 years. At least for me this new episode was AWESOME! In fact\\, I will go to see it again. Just ignore the haters.","true":true}
