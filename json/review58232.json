Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"2 1\/2 stars (exactly half the maximum) is the most generous rating I could give\\, taking into account both fans and casual movie-goers. As passable entertainment\\, it delivers quite well. There is an adequate amount of lightsabering\\, posturing and laser pewpewing to convince casual fans of the franchise that this is a good film. \\n\\nHowever\\, it doesn't quite sit snuggly into the mythos and cannon of Star Wars. True\\, Rian Johnson took the cannon in a different direction (and earned a Saturn award for it) but one could say the same if he put a Jedi cat in the movie too. It establishes a few unreasonable precedents as well. A nobody can train themselves to defeat the top Dark Jedi of the First Order handedly and fly a spaceship better than the one who owned it for most of his life\\, with no further exposition. I just feel sorry for all the young Jedis-to-be\\, who quite literally think they are Jedi Masters\\, eschewing training and thinking they are the next Rey. \\n\\nI ultimately see a satirical archetype waiting to be brought to the screen\\, and that is one of the only conceivable ways to follow up a SW movie like Rian Johnson's. A lot of the visual gimmicks are insultingly obvious cash grabs --- the Porgs\\, although they are designed to be cute like the Ewoks\\, do nothing in the film except to look cute and churn out a few laughs --- unlike the Ewoks\\, which actually served a purpose in the plot.\\n\\nIf I have never heard of Star Wars past seeing a lunchbox from the 1980s\\, then I think I would have thoroughly enjoy this film. And that's how I recommend fans watch this film. Feign Alzheimer's\\, and keep picturing that Star Wars lunchbox in your head. You welcome.","true":true}
