Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"after the force awakens and Rogue One\\, the Last Jedi is a massive disappointment\\, from the humour\\, massive holes in the plots and just a lazy rehashing of the previous storylines.\\, it's a Disney mess of a film.","true":true}
