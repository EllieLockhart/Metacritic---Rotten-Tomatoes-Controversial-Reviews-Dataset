Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. I saw IV\\, V\\, VI in the movie theater when I was a kid. I was not a fan of I\\, II\\, III - I liked the story arc\\, but not the characters\/actors. Last Jedi was very cool in my opinion and I love VII\\, III.5\\, and now VIII. Big Fan of what Disney is doing with the Universe. I have read a couple books\\, and read a couple comics\/graphic novels. I wanted to add my 5 because I think the 52% on RT right now is heavily skewed by a few nay-sayers and I wanted to add light to their dark.","true":true}
