Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Underwhelming. Apart from 2 action scenes at the beginning and end\\, the film drags and feels longer than it is. \\n\\nAs a Star Wars fan\\, i wasn't fond of a few story and character decisions but it was exciting to see certain characters again.","true":true}
