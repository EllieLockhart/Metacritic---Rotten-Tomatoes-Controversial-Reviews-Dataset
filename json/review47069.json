Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a great film! A few minor niggles - a bit too long\\, Finn storyline was a bit pointless and that Leia moment! Other than that though i (and my 9 year old son) loved it! Yes its a bit different but so what?? Shake things up a bit :)","true":true}
