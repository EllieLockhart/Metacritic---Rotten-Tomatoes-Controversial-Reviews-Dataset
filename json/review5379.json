Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Despite a brilliant performance from Mark Hamilton this isn't a good film. In fact it's probably the worst film of the entire saga. Most of the dialogue is clunky and a little cringe worthy\\, character motivation isn't consistent with the other films. The plot is so gerrymandered together that you have to wonder what was the point of half of the action set pieces they threw in. \\n\\nIt feels like today is the day that Star Wars died.","true":true}
