Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"AWFUL!!!!!  this movie is spit on the face of Star Wars. The target audience is about 5 years old but it is too violent for a 5 year old.   Mind you\\, not violent in an interesting way\\, it's all awful junk..   I HATE HATE HATE Disney Star Wars..","true":true}
