Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film that finally killed Star Wars. \\n\\nWhat can I say. My love for this amazing story started in 1977 and grew as Empire and then Jedi were released.\\n \\nWhen Timothy Zahn's novels came out (the REAL Episodes 7-9) it brought back the magic. \\n\\nWhen the Episode I was released\\, there were some things I definitely had a hard time with but we got Maul... Qui-Gon Jinn... a plotting Palpatine... John Williams amazing score... and spectacular lightsaber battles.  And with Episode 3\\, we actually got some great moments of drama\\, emotion and pathos.\\n\\nWhen Force Awakens came out\\, I had high hopes.\\nFor me\\, it was Rogue One that alerted me that something was wrong... that Disney was cynically exploiting our affection for Star Wars to push its agendas and ideologies. \\n\\nThen Last Jedi came out... and that was it. \\nAs Luke said in Return of the Jedi: \\\"Then you are truly dead.\\\"","true":true}
