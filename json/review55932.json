Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"RIAN JOHNSON\\, Henceforth you shall be known as Lukekiller.\\nHe...is the chosen one. He...will bring ruination.\\nThis will be a day long remembered.

Fear of this despicable film.\\n\\nKathleen Kennedy is a great monster\\, as wise as Jar Jar Binks and as powerful as B1 battle droid.\\nDon't be too proud of this deception terror she's constructed.\\nThe more you tighten your grip\\,Kennedy\\, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\\nShe's more machine now than woman\\, twisted and evil.\\nShe could use the Money to influence the Critic to create...fake.\\nFaith in your Critics misplaced may be.\\nAs is your faith in the fake of the News.\\nIs the Money stronger? No\\, no. Quicker\\, easier\\, more seductive.\\nYour money powers will not work on me\\, girl.\\n\\nSometimes there are things no one can fix.\\nDeath is a natural part of franchise.","true":true}
