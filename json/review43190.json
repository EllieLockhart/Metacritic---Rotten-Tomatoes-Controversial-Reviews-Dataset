Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This slopplily written\\, poorly paced film doubles down on the directions of the force awakens\\, fully reverts the galaxy back to the state of the Original Trilogy\\, negates the legacy of Episode 1-6; and what's worse\\, completely ruins Luke Skywalker as a character. \\n\\nTwo films deep into the trilogy\\, the film is yet to establish a single new character that has any similar impact as that in the last two sagas. Those characters that were promised to play big roles in the last instalment were discarded in the most unsatisfying manner. It still relies on the OT characters for emotional impact\\, while at the same time stomps all over what happened in the OT. \\n\\nWith some spectacular set pieces and amazing cinematography in places\\, those who were not that invested in Star Wars previously may find it an enjoyable ride. But a portion of Star Wars fans would find themselves in the same position as Mark Hamill when he first read the script: 'fundamentally disagreeing'.","true":true}
