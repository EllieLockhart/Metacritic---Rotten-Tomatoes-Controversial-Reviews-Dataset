Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen. I was genuinely embarrassed taking my father to see this who saw Star Wars in the theaters in 1977. Disney\\, Lucas films\\, Kathleen Kennedy\\, Rian Johnson\\, and Bob Iger should all be embarrassed by this disgusting incompetence of a film. I pray to all higher powers in this vast galaxy of ours\\, that JJ Abrams starts the 9th film by saying that episode 8 was a \\\"terrible vision\\\" or something that could fit into a fantasy world. If they don't do this in some fashion\\, episode 9 will be a sloppy and terrible film. I feel really bad for JJ Abrams for having his vision and set up thrown out the window by Ruin Johnson. Disney's terrible mismanagement of this once beloved franchise is resulting in fans leaving left and right. So much potential\\, instead we get a bad political message and a middle finger to the fans who have supported star wars through out the years. We miss you George.","true":true}
