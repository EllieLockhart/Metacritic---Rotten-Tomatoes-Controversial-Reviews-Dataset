Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Force Awakens revitalised Star Wars\\, which was waning after the poorly received prequel trilogy. This should have been the film that made Star Wars the ultimate movie power in the galaxy. Instead we get plot holes\\, poor character development\\, questionable CGI\\, awful pacing\\, and what feels like a rushed half arsed attempt to make a Star Wars film by people who don't understand the series that really fails to live up to expectation. \\n\\nThe longest Star Wars film to date padded by a second act that could have been completely avoided with a conversation between 2 of the most underused characters in this movie (Poe and Vice Admiral Holdo). \\\"That scene with a Row of Rey's\\\" which not only felt out of place in Star Wars but stopped the whole film dead in its tracks. And a frankly boring 5 minute scene about the origin of blue milk which would have felt pointless in the prequels. These are just a few I can name without giving spoilers.\\n\\nThe film has bright moments and there were bits I enjoyed for sure\\, but I came out of the cinema with an overwhelming feeling of disappointment. The good bits were too far and in between and over all ruined by the movies desperate attempt to shoe horn in the Marvel style comedic stings which just serve to pull you out of the moment\\, God forbid we start to feel anything other than happy warm feelings during the movie.\\n\\nAs a huge Star Wars fan I felt let down by this film which definitely falls on the dark side of the Star Wars see-saw. But maybe that's the point\\, after the hope and joy of The Force Awakens\\, we need balance. Well this film certainly brings that the balance.","true":true}
