Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've camped out for every film since Empire. I always attend multiple viewings\\, buy the films early\\, merch\\, etc. you didn't just ruin the film\\, my Christmas holiday excitement but you crapped on the fans. Your treatment of Luke was inexcusable. Disney\\, I will never step foot in your parks or buy your products. I'm throwing everything out I ever purchased from you. I won't even buy this film to watch at home. Escapism. I'd rather watch Jar Jar Binks. I will NOT watch anything that Rian Johnsons is involved in either. MASSIVE MISCALCULATION!","true":true}
