Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Who the hell approve this fucking mess\\nI mean Jesus christ\\nThis film is the true test of how much friends will put up with before letting a star wars film sink below a perfect 10 rating.People think this is quality this is made with some level good writing this is a horrifying mess and easily the worst star wars film in the entire series\\, you can like it as much as u want but its a fucking disaster.","true":true}
