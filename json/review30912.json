Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So close to being perfect. \\n\\nThe Last Jedi has a great mix of nostalgia but my experience wasn't as great as I got neck deep in rumours and almost nothing I wanted to happen\\, happened. \\n\\nSelf inflicted.","true":true}
