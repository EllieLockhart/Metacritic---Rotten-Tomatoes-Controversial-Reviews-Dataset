Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hollywoodized rehatch of Empire Strikes Back. Thin story line with back to back action sequence may capture the attention of the ADHD band-wagoner\\, but seriously\\, these last 2 sequels of the Star Wars sega is garbage rehatch of the original IV and V\\, completely uninspiring. The only good thing coming out of this is the justice the movie did for General Organa\\, RIP Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
