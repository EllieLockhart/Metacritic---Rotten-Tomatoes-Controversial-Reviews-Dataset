Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ill be the first to admit I'm a bit biased\\, but this film's RT score on the user side is far lower than it should be. I never do the user review thing\\, but in this case I am more than willing to sound off on a film that does exactly what we asked for in response to The Force Awakens by exploring new sides of the Star Wars mythos and gives us something more than a rehash of previous episodes. There are some minor pacing issues at play\\, and the fact that the film feels in the vein of a Star Wars Expanded Universe novel in movie form is going to either make this the best thing ever (my case) or the worst thing ever depending on your thoughts on those storytelling conventions. All in all\\, once the smoke clears from the initial backlash against it from a vocal minority\\, this will be remembered as the peak of Star Wars post OT\\, and is easily my second favorite Star Wars film\\, only behind the perfectly paced Empire Strikes Back. Excellent work Rian!","true":true}
