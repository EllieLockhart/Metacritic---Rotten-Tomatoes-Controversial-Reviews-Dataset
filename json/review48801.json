Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst.\\nStar Wars.\\nEver. \\nThe entire Fin and Rose storyline is complete trash.\\nLuke as a character is like Rian Johnson said fuck every piece of source material we got\\, this is my movie.\\nLeia Poppins.\\nRey's parents.\\nThanks for wasting two years wondering about who the fuck Snoke is to have literally no answers.\\nDialogue worse than the prequels? Check.\\nThis movie is god awful\\, I know there's more terrible shit in the movie but I started blacking out to keep from getting a stroke. Fuck Rian Johnson and fuck this movie.","true":true}
