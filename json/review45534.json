Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed with this Star Wars movie.\\nThe plot was horrible and the way the killed many of the characters was weak! \\nMovie dragged on and the acting was horrible.\\nDisney has its on agenda and it's fine. \\nI will think twice before spending anymore of my hard earned money!!!","true":true}
