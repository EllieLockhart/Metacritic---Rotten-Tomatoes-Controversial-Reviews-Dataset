Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have seen every Star Wars movie in the theater.  That being said this one pissed me off so much i will not waste my money seeing the next one in the theater i will wait for it to come out on a steaming service.  Rey is a mary sue\\, Rlyo is an emo punk who has none of the gravitas of his grandfather or even his uncle has\\, Leia's death when she got blown out of the ship would have been a perfect way to explain her death in rl but no all of a sudden she has massive jedi powers out of nowhere\\, and they made Luke a joke of his former self.  No they wont get that much of my money again beyond whatever streaming service pays them to stream the movie","true":true}
