Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Spoilers ahead: Be Warned: My husband I both liked and enjoyed The Last Jedi. It was everything that a Star Wars movie was meant to be. I was kind of disappointed with some of the scenes which reminded me of ROTJ but other than that\\, I enjoyed the movie. It was good to see Carrie Fisher in her role as Leia. I have a feeling that in the next movie that her son in the movie\\, Kylo Ren will be the one to kill her and that will truly make him evil. I was saddened with the way that Luke died but knows he is with the Force and is not truly dead. I was thrilled though with the death of Supreme Leader Snook and Phasma. All in all\\, a good movie and looking forward to the next one. Long live the Resistance!","true":true}
