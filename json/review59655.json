Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I really hoped that this would not be a banal continuation about Ellie and Joel\\, who go to some safe place and simultaneously strengthen their relationship again. And how glad I am that the sequel takes a completely different idea for the concept and more deepens me much more as a player in the game world than part 1 did. The second part has the concept of a cycle of revenge\\, which we will study immediately from two sides of the conflict. I really liked that the first half of the game\\, we go through revenge\\, and the second half of the path of redemption. The gameplay has become much deeper and more interesting\\, and the study of locations has become much more fun. The atmosphere has become much darker and no longer has a division into white and black\\, which can be seen in 1 part.  The Last of Us Part II is the most beautiful game I have ever seen. I like that there are much more moments similar in atmosphere to Resident Evil. The gameplay in the hospital for Abby is definitely one of my favorite moments in the game. As in the first part\\, I am pleased that I was not given a choice at the end. I'm glad for Ellie that she was able to let go of her revenge and off cycle of pain. And I'm definitely happy for Leo and Abby\\, who\\, I hope\\, will find Fireflies and happiness.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
