Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring.

Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've never felt so cheated and disappointed in a film in my entire life.  Pointless characters that serve no plot advancement or any sort of purpose.
