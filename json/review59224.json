The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This game already has well over twice the positive ratings as the original had overall ratings.  It has 34k negative ratings\\, and most of those came out the day of release\\, 99% from people who heard what happens in the game and didn't like it\\, following the leaders of their youtube\/twich groupthink.\r\rGameplay: 10\/10 - This is easily among the best gameplay the PS4 has to offer.  Anyone discounting gameplay to give this game a 1 either didn't play the game or is so immeasurably butthurt\\, their review should be withdrawn from the calculation.\rGraphics: 9.5\/10 - See above\rStory: 8\/10 - The story isn't as good as the first game\\, but TLoU's story was probably the best in any game ever\\, so that is hard to beat.  It was also a vastly different game\\, focused on one character's selfishness and restrained madness. Joel channeled his lack of ability to save his daughter and her death at the hands of humans to Elie and his general hatred for humanity.  This made him choose Elie over humanity\\, despite not giving Elie a choice in the matter.  Joel was selfish and wanted Elie to live to sate his own failures\\, and keep him from loneliness.  This selfish and hateful act inevitably brings its comeuppance both in his demise and the turn to madness monstrosity that befalls the one he was so desperate to save.  It is like what he held onto was a hatred and disgust for humanity\\, and that manifested in Elie by no agency of her own.  People forget that the fireflies saved Elie from drowning.  She was incapacitated when they took her to the surgery room to save humanity.  Marlene knew Elie far better than Joel\\, and knew she would be more than willing to have sacrificed herself so that all those she lost would not have died in vain\\, so that there would be no more Rlieys killed by this plague.\rBalls: 15\/10 - It is refreshing for a game to take such daring steps that they know will inevitably anger the gamer bro and white nationalist communities.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
