Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To avoid giving away spoilers I will just say I went into this movie with very little expectations. I generally grade any Star Wars movie on a curve\\, do to many different factors. With that said this movie has actually made me question if I have any interest in seeing the next installments. Plot holes\\, lack of plot\\, terrible characterization\\, political issues\\, even continuity issues. At one point a character is dressed differently in the next scene which made no sense to me (Least of its problems but it shows a lack of attention to detail I DO expect from the series). This by far demonstrates that Rotten Tomatoes and critics do not in anyway actually reflect the quality of the movie. \\n    It should be noted that even the horrible prequels did not steer me away from the genre like this one. I really have no interest in what happens to any of the characters now. I never thought I'd feel that way about Star Wars. There were SOOO many missed opportunities here\\, so many directions the movie could have gone in but the writing was sloppy\\, bland\\, obvious and the direction is nothing less than a nose dive. Just for the record\\, I did enjoy Force Awakens\\, and I was excited to see what was next. Not sure how I feel now. Bummer","true":true}
