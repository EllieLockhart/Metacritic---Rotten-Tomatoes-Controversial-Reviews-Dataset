Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst Star Wars movie of All-Time.  No continuity between the old films or even \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" for that matter.  Luke Skywalker has been ruined for me and the whole Rey parents thing had the stupidest explanation possible.  Snoke was built up to be a \\\"G\\\" and he went out like a complete punk bitch.  Kathleen Kennedy needs to step down out of shame.  Too much political agenda in here and it's obvious.  EPIC FAIL!!!  I was super excited for this film and it was the hugest let down I have ever experienced in my whole life in my 36 year career of film watching even taking down my last predecessor in X-Men the Last Stand.  They honestly need to apologize for releasing this piece of crap to the public.","true":true}
