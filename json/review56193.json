Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(STAR WARS FAN\/FANATICS DON'T READ! Sorry AJ!)\\n\\nUpfront let me say I am not into Star Wars\\, Star Trek or\\, in general\\, sci-fi movies though I did see the first two of the former and vaguely remember liking them. For the last movie I was to see in 2017 \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" I would put it on my yearly list as one of the worst\\, most boring\\, one of the needlessly longest movie of the year but I am afraid if I do they would lynch me!\\n\\nI read a story recently that Star War fans were upset during showings because they thought at one point in the movie the sound had gone out and was going to stop the movie but the director\/screenwriter had purposely done it that way. The distributor\\, Disney\\, had asked the critics not to give any spoilers but some did so the audience would know this was not a mistake. Folks the scene lasted 2-3 seconds maybe and a big fuss was made about this?\\n\\nTo me the fuss should have been about the length of 2 hours and 30 minutes which could have easily been shortened just by cutting a couple of the aerial dogfights that just basically repeated the same thing over and over.\\n\\nA fuss should be made about the obviously placed species that you could just hear Disney saying\\, \\\"We could make millions with this cute creature\\\"!\\n\\nI know some of the history of the heroes and two of the villains but\\, unless it was told in another movie or I missed it in this one\\, why is Rey picked to be the next Jedi\\, unless it is politically correct to show another strong woman which the series has always had in Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia and now has another in Laura Dern's Vice Admiral Holdo?\\n\\nPrevious stars Harrison Ford\\, Alec Guinness\\, James Earl Jones\\, Mark Hamill and the aforementioned Carrie Fisher made strong impressions from their appearance in the first movie but\\, come on; Adam Driver an inheritor of the Darth Vader role?\\n\\nI was impressed by Oscar Isaac who has the same throw away style of Ford along with the gravitas the character needs. Kelly Marie Tran stood out as Rose a resistance fighter but I seem to recall John Boyega having\\, and being\\, a stronger in the last movie but here he is wasted.\\n\\nAnd why oh why does the music have to blast every 5 minutes? To keep the audience awake?\\n\\nThe only good s about \\\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" was 1) though I thought it would never end it did and 2) it was the first completely free moviepass movie I saw!","true":true}
