Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Crap movie! Very inconsistent with its own plot from the first movie much less the entire star wars lore. I am sure the director never heard of the star wars movies much less watched them. Next time you have a new director create a sequel\\, have them watch the previous movie and read up just a page or so on the lore. OR\\, get a few of the millions of fans to come in and give feedback on your plot line. Synopsys: Luke an old emo Grinch that has no real power and can't see the good in people any longer; Leia is an immortal flying wizard super woman terminator; Rey is a force god (with two weeks of inexperience under her belt); Kylo is a barely force sensitive snot nosed millennial with daddy issues and a bad temper; the emperor really has no power and only serves to display a return of the jedi moment; the entire galaxy forgot about force field shields; there is now gravity in space; single fighters can take out entire giant battle ships (see shield reference); death star laser cannons can only make tiny holes in giant doors\\, ginormous ships can be taken out by ramming others ships into them (see shield reference again)\\, the first order now controls the entire galaxy\\, the rebel alliance is only made up of a few hundred people.","true":true}
