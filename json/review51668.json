Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A departure from what is normally expected from a Star Wars film\\, but in the best way possible. Rian Johnson sees what we want and plays with it that left me enthralled and eager for more Definitely one of the best films in the franchise.","true":true}
