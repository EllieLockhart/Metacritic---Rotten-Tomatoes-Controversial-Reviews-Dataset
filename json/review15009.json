Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I knew this movie would be polarizing....and as a lifelong Star Wars\\, while I understand why people are upset\\, I personally enjoyed it greatly and think it\u2019s my favorite thus far. It\u2019s not the same Star Wars anymore for sure\\, but it\u2019s still Star Wars. Maybe the reviews\\, like the film and the SW world itself\\, requires balance from the \u201clight\u201d and \u201cdark\u201d. ","true":true}
