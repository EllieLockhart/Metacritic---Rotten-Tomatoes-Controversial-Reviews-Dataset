Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars TheLast Jedi definitely was something different unlike the previous film. The visuals and actions were on point. I think Luke's story arc now can come to an almost end. It was a very entertaining film despite some boring parts. I think there was some unnecessary comedy for some characters that didn't need it in the first place\\, not only it damage the film but the way you look at the characters specially if they are bad guys. Also they completely disregard the Knights of Ren all together\\, there were some things that didnt carry over from the previous film. It was a nice addition but a very disappointing conclusion until episode 9 arrives.","true":true}
