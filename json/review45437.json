Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very critic who lied in their review for political reasons should be fired. This movie was a violent\\, intentional assault on the franchise\\, haphazardly\\, yet methodically destroying everything good about the Star Wars Saga\\, leaving it in smoking ruins. Halfway through this dismantling of the franchise\\, I was brought to tears\\, feeling like a dear friend had died. I will never see another new Star Wars movie again as long as the hateful monsters running it are still at the smoking helm.","true":true}
