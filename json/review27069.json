Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most boring Star Wars movies since the prequels. Many of scenes were loaded with exposition and had none of the interesting aspects that made The Force Awakens great. Many of the plot elements in this movie were redundant and created more questions about the Star Wars universe than answers. On the other hand\\, the movie has gorgeous cinematography and some good ideas. The execution and the god awful\\, misplaced humor brings this film down drastically.","true":true}
