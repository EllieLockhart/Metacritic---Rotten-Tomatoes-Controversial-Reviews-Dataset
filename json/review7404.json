Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Es una buena entrega para los amantes de la Saga\\, creo que ha recibido muchas cr\u00edticas por el hecho de minimizar la participaci\u00f3n de Luke; sin embargo tenemos que entender que ya viene una nueva generaci\u00f3n de personajes\\, si habr\u00eda algo que podr\u00eda criticar es el abuso de escenas con tintes de comedia\\, siento que algunos chistes est\u00e1n de m\u00e1s; si m\u00e1s a mi me agrad\u00f3 y creo que lo mejor se espera en el Episodio IX.","true":false}
