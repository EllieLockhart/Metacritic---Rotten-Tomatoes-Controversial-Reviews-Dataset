Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Too long (::way::too long)\\, too many superfluous characters\\, too many unanswered questions (Rian Johnson told fans curious about Snoke to go pound sand)\\, no real lightsaber fights\\, too much \\\"across the universe via the Force\\\" expositoin\\, too many cutsie animals\\, and an insulting treatment of Luke Skywalker (I agree with Mark Hamill's assessment of it not being \\\"his Luke Skywalker\\\").\\n\\nThe script was weak (capital ships \\\"running out of fuel\\\" seems to be the centerpiece of the story\\, which is about as compelling as \\\"trade route disagreements\\\").  This is exactly what one would expect when a corporation takes over coming up with movie ideas.  Rian Johnson's ego has run amok in this one\\, trying to reinvent the franchise and move it away from its core ideas.\\n\\nGo watch Rogue One again if you want a Star Wars fix.  It was a true masterpiece that honored the franchise.","true":true}
