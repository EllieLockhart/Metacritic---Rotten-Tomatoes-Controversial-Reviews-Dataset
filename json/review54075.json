Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't so much mind the long run time\\, but I did notice it. It was interesting\\, with action scenes that had plenty of dramatic impact. There were a few rather gaping plot holes that I thought about only after it was over. People are bashing this film because it didn't cater to their fan theories\\, or a purple haired woman was in charge of the Rebellion. Frankly those complaints are childish and miss the point. This is unlike any other Star Wars movie\\, but it is definitely a Star Wars movie. \\n\\nIt's not without its flaws. There's an entire gambit that our heroes go on that results in absolutely nothing lost or gained. There's a sense that there are no stakes\\, since every character that dies is inconsequential. There's also a sense of breaking with tradition in the Jedi order itself\\, that many fans probably didn't like. I get where this complaint is coming from\\, but I kind of want to see where they go from here. Enjoyable\\, but definitely with flaws.","true":true}
