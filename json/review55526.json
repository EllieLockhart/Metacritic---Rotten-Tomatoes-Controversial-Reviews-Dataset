Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never before has a film offered such an entertaining ride only to have it sour so woefully once the end credits rolled.  That is because the film itself was constructed to cover the real intent of severing itself from the original fan base. This covert tactic only sparked the true rebellion and showed that we original fans have a powerful voice left in us.\\n\\nUnderstand this.  It's not that the filmmakers were unknowledgeable about the legacy.  This was a clear agenda to dismantle what had inspired so many\\, only to forge perpetual wealth for the franchise going forward.\\n\\nI have no issues with a new direction for a film series\\, but this entry actually impacts the beloved original saga in a way that we cannot wipe it out from our minds.\\n\\nLow blow\\, but not unexpected.  I think we are really in a dire state if we are now relying on Abrams as the savior.  Who served as a producer in this encoded installment\\, let us not forget.\\n\\nMy suggestion would be for creative minds to use this as inspiration to write their own stories.  To look for inspiration with today's movies is a foolish errand at this point.  The Last Jedi is but the latest proof of this.","true":true}
