Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not giving away any spoilers\\, but extremely disappointed with the last Jedi. Waited a night to digest everything and find two crucial issues: no character development and lack of grand scope that the original movies had. Plot seems too isolated and insignificant to the rest of the universe. Disney and Lucas films need to stop over thinking the formula and stick to the blueprint.","true":true}
