Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very polarizing movie. While the execution (soundtrack\\, acting\\, visuals) was amazing\\, I felt most choices they decided to take with the script fell very flat\\, and the pacing was all over the place. Overall\\, an okay\\, but flawed\\, movie.","true":true}
