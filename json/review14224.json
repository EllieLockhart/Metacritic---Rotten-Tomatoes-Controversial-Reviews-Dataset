Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I give it a 3 at best and I'm probably going to wait for the final episode to come out on DVD or stream it. WEAK story\\, diluted among too many plot lines and absurd Deus ex Machina incidents. Character development is non existent. Sure the FX are strong\\, but so what? It's astonishing how the elite reviewers' taste is soo divergent from the audience's.","true":true}
