Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointed no spoilers but god was it hard to make interesting characters besides Mark Hamil(still a legend) and somewhat Rey\\, fell flat with everyone else and I liked Finn the most in the first movie now hes been reduced to something of a side character that does a useless task for an hpur an a half(slight spoiler I guess)","true":true}
