Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most brilliant Star Wars where layers of understanding are served in a symphony of action\\, emotion\\, moral and spirituality. All of these flowing in magnificent scenarios where past and future of the saga unite in sublime ways. Luke and Leia tribute  some of their best and new stars strength their roles\\, messages\\, missions and also nurse existential doubts. Life. Absolutely not to be missed.","true":true}
