Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie sucked. Kelly Marie Tran might be a good actress but her character was flat out annoying in this movie. I'm still shocked at the fact Luke never leaves his little island to help the resistance or teach Rey anything useful about the force. \\n\\nWorst part is\\, since Rain Johnson killed off Luke\\, the next director wont be able to redeem lukes character in the last installment. So sad","true":true}
