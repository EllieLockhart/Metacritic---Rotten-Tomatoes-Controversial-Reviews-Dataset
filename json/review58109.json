Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars movie ever made. The professional critics are being paid for high ratings. This movie is VERY VERY BAD.\\n\\nThe entire premise of the movie\\, the entire premise\\, is the rebel fleet gliding through space at 30 mph with star destroyers behind it too slow to close the distance and deliver a final blow. The plot holes only get bigger from there.","true":true}
