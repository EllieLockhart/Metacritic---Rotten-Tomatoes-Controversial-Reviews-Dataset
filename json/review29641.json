Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson singlehandedly destroyed the future of Star Wars. Bad storytelling\\, and a slap in the face to not only fans\\, but to children who will not understand who badly they are destroying this story. This is the problem when a director doesn't take the myth seriously-essentially the modern problem with making fun of mystery and the sacred. There's no new hope for this legend\\, which is unfortunate because it holds such a wonderful space in my imagination. \\nI won't give any spoilers\\, but i just need to say this publicly.","true":true}
