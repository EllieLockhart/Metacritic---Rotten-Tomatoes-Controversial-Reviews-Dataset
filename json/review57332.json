Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie isn't exactly what star wars fans were hoping for... but it is a spectacle\\, an exiting action movie that explores its characters and lore more deeply in preparation for the final movie while still standing on its own. It keeps the Star Wars feel alive in its music\\, visuals and plot hooks\\, but manages to move away from the expected formula through a series of twists and revelations which leave each of our remaining cast different than they were at the beginning of the film. This twisting plot however\\, does leave some unnecessary tangents in the story that\\, while important for the characters\\, feel fruitless to their ultimate goals of protecting the galaxy. Despite its flaws I recommend this film to any fan of star wars who is ready for a change of pace in the series.","true":true}
