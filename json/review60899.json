The graphics look amazing\\, especially in 4K\\, the feel of terror and fear you have around every corner adds more to the amazing feel naughty dog have tried to make with this game. This is mainly accomplished by the incredible soundtrack they have put together for the game and the level design and details they have in the game. If I had the option of rating the game out of 100\\, it\u2019d be a 98\\, this is because I wish they had a difficulty trophy to the game to encourage more people to play and experience the game on the survivor option. They have added a myriad of new setting features to the game which can improve your game play while also scaring you half to death in various areas.
