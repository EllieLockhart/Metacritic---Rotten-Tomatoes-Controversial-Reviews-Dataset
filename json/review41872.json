Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie Is the end of Star Wars as we know. Have a Lot of plotholes bigger than the force awekens. In  general Is fun to watch but Is horrible as Star Wars movie.","true":true}
