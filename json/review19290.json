Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's not remotely Star Wars.  Millenials might love it\\, or those with the regressive agenda obsession\\, but as far as the Star Wars saga goes - it's terrible.  No character development\\, no story\\, just Kathleen Kennedy's activist clipboard being ticked off by her adoring little Rian.","true":true}
