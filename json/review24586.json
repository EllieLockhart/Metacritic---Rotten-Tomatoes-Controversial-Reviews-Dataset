Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie is messy\\, doesn't make sense and tries too hard to be marvel movies. Subplots get picked up and abandoned\\, characters have no development\\, major plot points don't make any sense. Ultimately it is clear that this was directed by an amateur trying too hard to set himself apart\\, though some of this blame falls on Disney for hiring him (or really\\, hiring more than one director for an entire trilogy). All around a bad movie that tries to hide behind flashy cgi. ","true":true}
