Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At times it was utterly brilliant\\, and at other times it was horribly ham-handed. It could stand to lose about 30-40 minutes and an entire storyline. 'Less is more' seems to be hard for Hollywood to do these days. I look forward to seeing fan edits in the future. With the right cuts\\, I bet it could be devastatingly good.","true":true}
