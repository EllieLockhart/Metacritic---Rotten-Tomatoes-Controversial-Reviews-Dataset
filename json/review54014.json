Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I cannot believe that anyone would say that this movie honors anything about the other films' legacy\\, it doesn't even honor its predecessor\\, \\\"The Force Awakens\\\". This is a husk of a film\\, devoid of soul and character...and plot. It's perfect for those who mistake the vanity of special effects combined with completely cliche\\, stupor-inducing\\, 4th wall-breaking humor and dialogue for something useful or meaningful. It feels mopey\\, and sad\\, yet unimportant. The entire conflict of the film seems laughably small in scale\\, as a seemingly few dozen ships and people at odds speak in terms of galactic importance. The feeling of desperation and a true conflict is lost here. \\n\\nPeople will meander about and then occasionally give empowering speeches and talk about resistance and love and how important what they're doing is. You will actually root for the antagonists and hope their opposites are killed off just to spare you their stupidity and the one dimension they exist in. (The First Order are basically a bunch of bumbling police officers with billy clubs in a 1900's silent comedy film chasing a perp though\\, so good luck with that!)\\n\\nReferences to the original trilogy in this movie feel so mismatched\\, that it genuinely feels like a parody when you do hear a familiar score\\, or see a familiar sight. You'll hear plenty of recycled dialogue though (to much lesser impact\\, of course). Old characters are butchered and inconsistent as they pull 180's from who they actually are to make this story happen. Men of great wisdom will revert to sulking\\, childlike states and tell you to leave them alone\\, as they storm off to their room while really wanting you to follow them and ask what's wrong. This is a film for the masses\\, that has conformed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Please\\, steer clear. You could hand me a rock and call it Star Wars and I'd probably be happy\\, and yet this film still manages to disappoint me.","true":true}
