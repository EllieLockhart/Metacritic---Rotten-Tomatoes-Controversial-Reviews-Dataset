Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Finally saw this on Bluray.  While I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan\\, I have seen all the films.  Not impressed.  Film basically goes nowhere at a crawl.  Plot is weak\\, many unnecessary subplots which lead nowhere.  WAY TOO LONG for the story? presented.  It picked up at the end right before I was going to fall asleep.  Princess Lea flight through space had me scratching my head.  Suoer Storm trooper character did nothing in the TFA and basically did nothing here either but die.  Why bother?  I'm ok with grumpy Luke\\, fine\\, but there wasn't much of a payoff at the end.  Question: Why do all you Star Wars fanboys expect a good film anyway?  50% of the Star Wars films are not good\\, this one is bad too.  Rogue One was the exception\\, that was good.
