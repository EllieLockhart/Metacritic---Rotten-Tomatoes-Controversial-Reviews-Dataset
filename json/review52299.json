Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A good film but not a good Star Wars film. Some great scenes and Mark Hamill was terrific. But more negatives than positives. Poor plot\\, misdirection of Luke's character\\, cheesy childish jokes. A wasted potential and a film that really shows the Disney influence and also the need to overpack it with action and drama to keep up to date with Marvel etc.","true":true}
