Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is no point in doing a bullet point about everything thats wrong with TLJ now. This movie is broken beyond any redemption. It gets the very few good things established in TFW and destroys them for a few dumb 'gotcha' momments. You dont have to be a 'star wars geek' like the rest of us to see everything that is broken in this mess. Anyone that understands a little about movie making\\, story telling and character development can see this pile of garbage from miles away. Please Disney\\, get your **** together.","true":true}
