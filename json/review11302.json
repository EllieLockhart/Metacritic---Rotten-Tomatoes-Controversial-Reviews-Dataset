Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Honestly was pissed when the movie ended. I am a huge star wars fan and if you are one too then you will be pissed.  Not only did everything I wanted to happen not happen but exactly the opposite. After giving it about 12 hours and thinking about what happened I realized what Johnson's vision was and how everything really added up. Movie made me feel every emotion from complete joy to spitting anger. For anyone who is going to see this movie just give it a couple hours and think about what you saw. Truly an amazing film.","true":true}
