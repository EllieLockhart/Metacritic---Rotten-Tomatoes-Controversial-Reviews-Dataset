Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Can't hold a candle to The Force Awakens. This movie is split between a boring and PC filler (literally running out of gas)\\, and an interesting story with Luke and Rey on the island. Plot holes galore. It wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't for the glowing reviews by \\\"critics\\\" and youtubers who saw it early\\, which are clearly biased and must have some cash incentive to positively review this mess. There are parts that are great\\, but overwhelmingly bad.","true":true}
