Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Is it too much to ask for: a) the film in the middle of a trilogy to tie into the previous one? (I'm Snoke most Evil Sith Grand Master all powerful-oops\\, I'm dead) b) a plot to make sense when you leave the cinema and think critically (star ships running out of gas)? c) the characters to have understandable motivations and act in a believable way\\, not as plot surprises (looking at you Laura Dern and your secret plan that is secret because... secrets...)?\\nOne has to ask why there is this massive discrepancy between \\\"critics\\\" in the media and the reactions of actual viewers? If this film wasn't set in the Star Wars universe and if it didn't utilize every protective SJW trope available to Disney it would be panned for the poorly constructed mess that it is.\\nPS Admiral Ackbar is dead. But at least they saved the space racing horses!","true":true}
