Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The plot of this movie is completely incoherent and riddled with holes. There are countless moments and decisions that went into the production of Star Wars 8\\, for which I cannot understand the logic behind\\, because there is none. It is the worst Star Wars movie to date by far. The visuals are great\\, but with the amount of money Disney put into this\\, you would expect that. The only redeeming qualities is has are the performances of Mark Hamill and Adam Driver\\, however that isn't enough to save it from a 1-star rating.","true":true}
