Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Fucking incredible. A perfect indictment of toxic masculinity. Loved that Leia was alien to be bisexual\\, and I'm such a huge fan of how much this just entirely killed so many darlings.","true":true}
