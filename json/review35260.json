Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good thing about The Last Jedi\\, is that it\u2019s not a cookie cutter formula like Force Awakens. The bad thing about it was that they tried to be so away from the formula they went to far. They tried to get you to assume what would happen and then they flipped everything on its head. And that made for a film that did not live up to the creed or storyline of other previos Star Wars films. Everything you thought you knew about Star Wars goes out the window. ","true":true}
