Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Interesting to see such a high score on the tomatometer while the audience rating paints a different picture.  To begin\\, I've been a fan of the series since the first \\\"trilogy\\\"\\, if you've watched any episodes before this one prepare to toss everything you know into the trash.  \\n1. Leia has apparently mastered the force in this movie despite never showing much potential lets say ever.\\n2. Rey goes to Luke for training but doesn't seem to really need it since she has all but mastered many abilities\\, seems to me she could have used her time more productively.\\n3. Luke's character is completely destroyed... don't expect to see a wise man who's developed since we last saw him\\, rather\\, he's a broken old man who doesn't make much of an impact and seems to simply exist (in the movie) to tie together a few story arcs.\\nThis isn't a star wars movie it's a \\\"Let's be very politically correct while adding some flash and humor\\\" scifi blockbuster.   Do not be deceived by the Star Wars title\\, the plot holes are plenty and the movie in a nutshell is a 2 1\/2 hour chase scene that ignores it's history for the sake of being fresh.","true":true}
