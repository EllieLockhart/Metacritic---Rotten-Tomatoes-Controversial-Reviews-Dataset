Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to like this movie\\, but couldn't bring myself to enjoy a 2.5 hour movie where only 45 minutes of it was decent.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is a cumbersome movie full of plot holes and horribly filmed scenes in an overwrought production . It's basically 2 movies\\, one is the interesting tale of the reluctant hero Luke Skywalker and his redeeming apprentice Rey and how they try and save the galaxy from a rebuilt Empire under Kylo Ren\\, then spliced into the larger and apparently more important story of how the janitor and all the little people are injured in the process.\\n\\nYes\\, it's that stupid. \\n\\nFinn (John Boyega)\\, a hapless Ms Swann character called Rose (Kelly Tran) and a bevvy of other useless and irrelevant characters clutter the screen and take away from the more interesting and better acted story of Luke (Mark Hamill) and Rey (Daisy Ridley). While the pair discuss the finer points of being a Jedi and how to deal with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) the rest of universe fights in ridiculous space fights to no purpose or end. \\n\\nFantastic lightsaber fights are reduced to horribly edited messes\\, and space battles which make no sense leave huge plot holes. Even Carrie Fisher as Leia has trouble with some of her lines\\, speaking as if she constantly had a base case of the flu. Most of the details of the previous movie were also just thrown out for no reason at all or explanation\\, making 'Force Awakens' completely irrelevant as well.\\n\\nWhile I sound unfairly harsh\\, is it really is that bad? Only in comparison to 'Force Awakens'\\, or the worst of the Star Wars movies\\, The Clone Wars\\, so I gave it 2.5 stars. Had the movie been only 90 minutes\\, and properly edited\\, and not bothered with how the space janitor and all of his non-essential friends fared\\, would it have been more watchable.\\n\\nAs it stands\\, no. This is what happens when you take a great story and let the studio heads write the script\\,and the editor takes a powder. \\n\\nThink of it like watching Hamlet\\, only from the perspective of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz\\, and you get the idea.","true":true}
