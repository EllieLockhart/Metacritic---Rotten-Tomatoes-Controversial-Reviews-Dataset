Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wanting to distance itself from the TFA for being too much like New Hope we are given a side buddy movie\\, a complete destruction of Luke Skywalker\\, and Mary Poppins in space. I expect the Millennium Falcon to explode in the next movie and the debris land on any surviving character from the original trilogy.","true":true}
