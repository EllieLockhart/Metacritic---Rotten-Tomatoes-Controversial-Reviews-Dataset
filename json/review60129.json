(in my opinion) A lot of the story moments are justified and the characters we hate are humanized in such a way that you are able to understand why they made particular choices and where they come from. The pacing definitely has issues. Some of the scenes should have been placed before others (if that makes sense). TheI can understand why people have such strong opinions on this game.

The pacing definitely has issues. Some of the scenes should have been placed before others (if that makes sense). The visuals are outstanding. The environments are so meticulously detailed and the gameplay blows the 1st game's gameplay out of the park. Naughty dog was brave to try something new and i understand why people are decisive about it. But i respect naughty dog for taking tough decisions. This isn't the best naughty dog game\\, its not even close\\, but I think that this is a pretty good game in my eyes. There are a few plot holes and the pacing was all over the place but thats not the end of the world for me(not pun intended). I think that it should be understood that revenge isn't the story of this game\\, its the plot. Ill be checking out new game plus on a harder difficulty.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
