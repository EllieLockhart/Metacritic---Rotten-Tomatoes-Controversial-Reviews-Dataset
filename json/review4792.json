Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely unexpected and new\\, The Last Jedi takes Star Wars to places we've never seen before. I'm not just talking about actual locations but the tone and the ideas and the philosophy that happens in this film is beyond incredible. People will always hate good movies for reasons beyond normal people's comprehension\\, but this movie delivers where Star Wars has been lacking or never had in the first place. Complete masterpiece.","true":true}
