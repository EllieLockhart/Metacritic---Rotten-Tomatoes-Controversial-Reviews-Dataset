Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Great movie\\, one of the best of the franchise. I admit that there are a couple of awful scenes\\, but the space battles are absolutely great\\, the plot is good\\, the acting is really good\\, and the characters development is impeccable. The movie is obviously a turning point in the franchise and i understand who didn't like it\\, but\\, instead\\, i loved it. A really fresh air breathe.","true":true}
