Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some visually cool spots in the movie\\, but really only in the third act. Should've been at least 45 mins shorter and less fluffy. Pretty disappointing especially after they just remixed A New Hope for the first movie.","true":true}
