Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The troll is over. It was one person guys. It's very easy for one person to add tons of reviews. I did this very easily without the aid of a bot. If I had a team of 10 people this score would be moved rather simply.  1000 people voting a few times a day is all it takes. \\n\\nFWIW most of the reviews submitted to RT don't have anything written. Look what I did in a single week? There are at least 3 YouTube video created about a few hundred reviews on a meaningless poll. All the claims that Disney was paying for reviews. Why would Disney care? Some guy on Reddit is scraping reviews here so \\\"analyze\\\" the data. If some of you were more curious about data\/statistics you'd realize that 200k votes for this film render this data statistically irrelevant. Please keep voting on this poll though. :)","true":true}
