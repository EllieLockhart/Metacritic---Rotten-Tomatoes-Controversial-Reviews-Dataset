Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is just a bad star wars film. It takes huge liberties with the force\\, makes Luke into an inconsistent goof and contradicts everything we've learned from the previous movies about what it means to be force-sensitive and wield a light saber. It's a farce.","true":true}
