Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There were certain elements of this film that were enjoyable. I could certainly appreciate its efforts to be unpredictable\\, but the plot is so nonsensical\\, tonally inconsistent and poorly paced that it left me feeling that I'd just watched a satire about Star Wars.\\n\\nUltimately Luke has no particular value to the plot\\, as Rey was gifted with perfect Jedi powers from birth and the subplot around Finn and the pilot (whose name I'm not sure I've ever actually established) is an example of wholly and egregiously unnecessary padding a film beyond it's natural runtime. If they wanted to make a movie essentially about running from bad guys more entertaining\\, then they really should have taken a leaf out of Mad Max's book. Such a lack of focus.","true":true}
