Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not as good as hoped or hyped. \\n\\nTechnically flawed with plot holes\\, and elementary mistakes.  Humor was unnecessary as we're many of the scenes mud film. Missed the potential of great characters and dynamics. \\n\\nGreat first 10 minutes\\, pretty good ending. Forget the rest.  Really let down.","true":true}
