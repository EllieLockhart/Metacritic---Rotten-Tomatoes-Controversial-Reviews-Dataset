Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horrible. Simply horrible. This movie was very bad.\\n\\nIf you thought E1-3 were bad you are in for a surprise. This sets the bar all time low. I actually watched E3 few days ago and cried. It touched me. During this movie I only laughed to the level of stupid jokes put into it.\\n\\nI will take a long time before I will watch another movie from Rian Johnson.\\n\\nAs a huge fan I went to see this movie with huge expectations. If and only if\\, I will ever see E9 it will be with 0 expectations. So bad this was.","true":true}
