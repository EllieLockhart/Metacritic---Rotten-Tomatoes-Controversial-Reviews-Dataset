Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's okay. It certainly isn't the best Star Wars movie. A lot of good things (like the scene in Supreme Leader Snoke's throne room)\\, and a lot of bad (like the fact that they gave a casino planet a 30 to 40 minute segment\\, but the only creative planet in the movie gets 5 to 10 minutes). The one thing that I loved was Luke Skywalker. I love how he's all cynical and sassy. It may be uncharacteristic\\, but I love it. A lot of the jokes fall flat. Captain Phasma is the new (but worse) Boba Fett. But the worst thing (to me at least) was that they ruined General Hux. In the force awakens I was like \\\"oh he's this trilogy's Grand Moff Tarkin.\\\" Yeah he is... in the force awakens. In the last Jedi he's a complete and total joke\\, and like most of the jokes in the movie\\, he is terrible! However there are a lot of great things. I already mentioned Luke Skywalker and the scene in Snoke's throne room. There's a lot of really cool action sequences. However the film just feels like an attempt to make Star Wars... Marvel. I think the only reason for why Marvel can get away with making quip after quip after quip is because that's what they've been since 2008. Star Wars has never been a franchise known for quips\\, but now I'm scared that it'll become one. 5\/10","true":true}
