We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Actual rating is around a 8.6\\, but rounded up as i cant do that.\r\rVery well written story. Never have i ever engaged more with a game and felt more emotionally tied to the main characters. I was aware of the leaks so was a bit apprehensive but i went in with an open mind and they have done a really good job with the story as i have grown to really love Abby as well now. Playing it multiple times have led to me seeing encounters i wasn't even aware off\\, and the foreshadowing for future events is really good.  The use of Ellie's Journal for her thoughts is phenominal\\, especially after she kills Mel and is suffering. She questions her own motives\\, which is why the ending was fine for me - It was never ever purely about revenge. As heartbreaking as the ending was\\, I believe it was the nicest thing we could have had for Ellie. She lost so much\\, I needed an end to all her guilt and that is exactly what we got\r\rDrawbacks i have for it are that I would have preferred a nice balance between the two characters. Abby felt like fight after fight whilst Ellie was story after story. I would have loved to see some more fighting from Ellie's aspect\\, and some more story telling from Abby's. I wasn't really that emotionally invested in Owen\\, Mel or Nora so felt unaffected when Abby went back to seek revenge for them. (Maybe thats what N-dog wanted\\, idk but I would've preferred some more story telling for Abby there (especially with Owen).\r\rAlso\\, there is no MULTIPLAYER. Very gutting. Plus so far there is no prospect for any DLC?!?!?!? I would have loved to see more about their life in Jackson\\, or some more about what Tommy and Joel got up to.\r\rI would like to have enjoyed to play with Ellie and Dina abit more. Their chemistry was fabulous.\r\rOverall\\, its a well thought out game. People hating on it for no reason imo and kudos to the ENTIRE naughty dog team. Even though people have mixed reviews about the game\\, there is no doubt about the hard work you done in making the environment\\, sounds\\, and accessibility.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
