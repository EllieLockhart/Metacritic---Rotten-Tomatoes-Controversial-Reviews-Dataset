Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went to see this film in 2017 and I still don't have a thing to say about this film. I was speechless. I was surprised and most of all I did not know what to think about this film. I wouldn't say it's bad because it's not but after thinking two years later about it\\, I have to say there were some bold decisions in this movie that I was not expecting at all. But it was a little underwhelming because it did not have a light saber duel or something that would make this feel like Star Wars. I know we are not going to get that but the charm of the originals is missing in these recent movies. I feel like they tried please the critics instead of the audiences when it came to telling a compelling story about Star Wars and not make a Rian Johnson film.","true":true}
