Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"J.J. reset the galaxy\\, and all but copied a New Hope\\, and left so many questions and gaps. Fans\\, giving him the benefit of the doubt\\, started to imagine all the ways that TFA wasn't  just a pretty but poorly written knock-off\\, placing the hope the TLJ would fill in the missing pieces.\\n\\nWell it turn out that there was no vision for the trilogy\\, and Rian wouldn't or couldn't explain away all the bad writing in TFA. Oh\\, and it's the fans fault for thinking that TFA or TLJ should or would make sense. or be cohesive. \\n\\nOn it's own\\, TLJ has nice visuals and decent acting\\, but I find it empty of substance or significance\\, heartless\\, and awkward. \\n\\nWhen IX comes out\\, go watch Spaceballs instead. \\n\\nP.S. If you like TLJ\\, good for you. This is just my opinion.\\nP.P.S What's with all the SJW comments?","true":true}
