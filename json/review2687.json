Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful and all over the place. Hard to believe a franchise like star wars can fall so far. You use to see fans sleep outside for any new star wars thing\\, now they leave thinking 'meh'. Not sure the new\\, upcoming one can save the damage this one did. ","true":true}
