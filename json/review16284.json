Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not going to write a long review. I'm just gonna tap on a few stars and say that I personally loved this movie. Lifelong fan of the Star Wars movies and stories\\, and this amazing work was a very welcome experience! I can't wait to see more.","true":true}
