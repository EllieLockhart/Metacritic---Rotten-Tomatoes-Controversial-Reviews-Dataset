Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I read that  posting a 1\/ 2 star review it is  not included in the totals here in RT\\, (same for a review of Not Interested it does not count as a negative)  and decided to change mine to 1 star. From what I understand this is still negative review.\\n\\nAnd 49% seems way off. 40% ..... maybe... unless this is a new math  I dont understand? 5 stars are woth 20 points...1 star 1 point? I have no idea\\, but something does not add up here.\\n\\nMost of the negative reviews on here\\, I agree with 100%\\, but will add something else that has come to mind as of late.\\n\\nI understand Ryan Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy are belittling the inteligence for anyone that does not like the movie and !  \\\" Does not understand the great wonderful message in the movie ! \\\" \\n\\nOkay... the great message of  Rey \\, Leia and the kid at the end of the movie with force ablitys.  The great message is ....\\n\\n\\\" Training or school  is for retards.  You know all you need to know now and should go to the top of anything you want without  having to work  for it.  You do  not need experience as this is your right ! Because ! You are special ! And you deserve it ! \\\"\\n\\n......Is this the great message in the movie  I missed ? \\n\\n\\\" Kids... you do not need school\\, you do not need experience\\, life owes you a living and the very  top position in whatever it is you want\\, school \/ training \/ experience is only for slow stupid people . \\\"\\n\\nWe need more people thinking they are entitled and deserving of everything without working for it......just because ?   Training\\, education and experience are ...redundant now? \\n\\nI did not think this was the sort of message we needed in this day and age... but...what do I know ? I am one of the crazy people ( the majority) that did not like the movie ( hated the movie)  So yes...it is obvious I did not get it.\\n\\nWow...\\n\\nBy the way\\, people with the 5 star reviews\\, and no details as to why\\, you look like paid trolls and or  real fools.\\n\\nThe honest people here\\, positive and negative\\, people in both camps\\, take the time to write out why they loved the movie\\, or ...like with  so many of us\\, why  hated the movie.\\n\\n\\\" Refreshing\\, new\\, great story\\, \\\"  \\\"Wonderful  character development \\\"  \\\"Best star wars movie ever ! \\\"  \\\"Dont listen to the whiney fan boys! Its great ! \\\" \\n\\nBullshit\\, shit reviews for a shit movie....\\n\\nIf you take time to think\\, everything in this movie is bad from story\\, to timeline\\, homor\\, plot holes\\, destuction of old star wars lore\\, to destruction of old characters... For No Reason\\n\\nI thought Disney would want to expand on the movie legacy\\, not destroy it.  But for many of us as fans\\, destroy it they did.\\n\\nWhat a shame\\, and what a waste of what could have been an incredible new legacy","true":true}
