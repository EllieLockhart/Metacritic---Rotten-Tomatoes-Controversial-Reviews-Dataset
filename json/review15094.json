Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I left this movie depressed ... you should NEVER leave a Star Wars midnight screening depressed.  Luke and Snoke\\, even Phasma and Finn ... wasted\\, just wasted.  Oh and thanks for all the sjw messages\\, like I really want to see that in a SW film.  Sad\\, just sad :(","true":true}
