Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A staggering achievement in film. I'm stunned that a script this good exists for a Star Wars film. No wonder JJ wanted to direct the movie himself when he ready it. Rian Johnson has created a truly unique and amazing chapter in the Skywalker Saga. Thanks  Rian!!!","true":true}
