Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. Truly Awful. How anyone can seriously hold this up as a good movie is beyond me. Its disappointing that StarWars has become a vehicle for people to signal which side of the political debate they are on in regard to social justice and identity politics. Politics aside\\, this is objectively\\, a terrible movie. The story telling\\, pacing\\, direction\\, character development\\, ALL objectively terrible. It doesn't respect the previous film\\, let alone the original trilogy. But\\, of course\\, to say so is to ally yourself with undesirables\\, guilty of wrong-think. I'm not a misogynist\\, nor am I a racist. I didn't mind TFA\\, apart from the central premise being fundamentally flawed of course (No need to fire on a planet if you have the ability to extinguish its star!). I even quite like Rey as a character. I have nothing against Disney either (I loved Rogue One). This movie however\\, is an absolute disgrace to the franchise and has left me\\, a life long Star Wars fan\\, with very little desire to see the next instalment. love him or hate him\\, JJ gave Rian Johnson plenty of material with which to build a compelling story\\, but what did we get? A slow chase through space and an inconsequential sub plot that had no baring on anything. Don't even get me started on his portrayal of Luke.... Awful. Just awful.     ","true":true}
