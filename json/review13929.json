Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you are satisfied with good visuals and have little attachment to episodes 1-6\\, you may like this movie.  However\\, if you grew up with 1-6 and episode 7 left you brimming with questions you were exited to have answered... this movie will feel like a slap in the face.","true":true}
