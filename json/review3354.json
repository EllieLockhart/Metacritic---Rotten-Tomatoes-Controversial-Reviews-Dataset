Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Besides a few cool actions scenes and the scenes between Rey and Kylo\\, this film is NOT Star Wars. Not only does it have the most boring plot with the most unimportant sideplots\\, the film is almost entirely filler with scenes taken out straight from rotj and esb. Horrible\\, can not believe the films stooped even lower to what The Force Awakens brought.","true":true}
