Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie felt like a waste of time. The majority of the plot focused on the purple haired girl as the antagonist\\, only to later reveal that she just didn't feel like telling anyone her plan. Rey (who apparently has no parents) hardly trained on the island since Luke was too old and whiny to do anything. Not to mention Snoke was killed off without having any backstory. This movie was horrendous\\, but gets 2 stars because the Yoda scene was pretty koo.","true":true}
