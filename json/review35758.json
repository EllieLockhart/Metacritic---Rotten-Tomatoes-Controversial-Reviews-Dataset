Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is easily ranked above the prequels\\, and outscores its predecessor (VII) by a good stretch. The movie combines strong characters with interesting pasts\\, intertwining plots that elevate the movie beyond popcorn\\, and some truly amazing fights. Throw in a few good laughs and some real fan-theory trouncing\\, and the movie is much fun and deep. There is a strong philosophical underpinning that will make TLJ a great conversational movie for generations to come.","true":true}
