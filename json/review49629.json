{"101487":199385,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-03-18","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow! This is such an awesome movie! If is one of\\, if not THE BEST movie in the franchise! I really liked this movie for multiple reasons\\, but let's get the biggest ones right off the bat: \\n\\n    First\\, this movie doesn't follow the average clich\u00e9s that happen to characters in most movies. For example\\, we expect to see Supreme Leader Snoke to die in this final battle at the end of Star Wars Episode IX\\, but we barely know a thing about him! Besides\\, this kind of storytelling has been used too many times. It's even been used before in this same franchise! So\\, it's a smart decision to go \\\"George R. R. Martin\\\"\\, so to speak\\, on Supreme Leader Snoke and kill him. And they even kill him like Darth Maul in a way! And they did the same thing with Captain Phasma\\, which is about the new saga's equivalent of Boba Fett: barely any lines\\, yet playing a huge role in the movie. She's too overrated\\, so they toss her into the fire and the flames of the ruins of Snoke's battleship. And regarding Rey's parents\\, many\\, many people thought that Luke Skywalker was Rey's father. Or other characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi\\, Han Solo\\, and so forth. But in the end\\, Rey's parents are literal nobodys. They didn't even have names! This is another story aesthetic that makes Star Wars: The Last Jedi a very good movie. Cool! Amazing! Kudos for Rian Johnson! \\n\\nSecond\\, it emphasizes a feeling of true desperation coming from the protagonists. Usual rebellions in movies are up against this huge unstoppable power\\, but somehow win at almost every turn. Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\, on other hand\\, allows the Resistance a single victory against the Empire. They even emphasize over and over that most of the Resistance fleet has been decimated against Captain Kennedy's First Order Dreadnaught\\, and that the Resistance has been driven from its base at the very beginning a movie. Most of the Resistance dies off completely. Even the Battle of Craig kills off most of the pilots\\, and it's only Luke's force-holographic image at the end of the movie that saves the Resistance. To quote from Leia: \\\"The Resistance is gone. The spark that was to burn down the First Order has gone out.\\\" And in addition\\, Luke doesn't even truly activate his lightsaber\\, let alone lay waste to the First Order. He even says in the movie: \\\"You think that I'm just going to come back and strike the First Order down?\\\" Cool! Amazing! Kudos for Rian Johnson! \\n\\nThird\\, the usual Mission: Impossible heist that is usually performed in moments of sheer desperation doesn't succeed in The Last Jedi. Instead\\, Finn\\, Rose\\, and BB-8 end up finding a code breaker that they were unaware of\\, instead of the supposed \\\"Master Code-Breaker\\\" that Maz Kannada was advising them towards. And instead of somehow disabling the First Order's power to track the Resistance ships\\, they end up being captured before even reaching the tracking module. Now\\, THAT'S what actually happens in real life\\, most of the time. Cool! Amazing! Kudos for Rian Johnson! \\n\\nThere are also a ton of other\\, smaller factors that help make this movie one of\\, if not the absolute best installment in the franchise. Factors like these include things like: \\nHumorous jokes that lightened up the mood of the audience. \\nMemorable storyline for a movie like Star Wars. \\nStunning visuals unmatched by any previous Star Wars movie. \\nIt's like the Empire Strikes Back: it's no \\\"good-guys-constantly-win\\\" movie. \\nThe poetry it tells as Luke's life comes to a close\\, as it shows almost the exact same sunset that Luke watches as he is just a baby at the end of Revenge of the Sith\\, and when he was at the verge of discovering the Force. The only difference is the location. \\nBesides\\, like I said earlier\\, it's just like the Empire Strikes back\\, which critics consider to be the best film in the franchise until The Last Jedi started rolling around the movie theaters. \\n\\n        Cool! Amazing! Kudos for Rian Johnson! \\n\\n    \\n    And yes\\, there are rooms for improvement. It could still be a bit shorter (especially with the casino scene)\\, and many parts of the story could be fleshed out more\\, but it's still much more PRO than CON. \\n\\n    \\n\\n    So\\, if you don't like The Last Jedi\\, that probably means that you were more used to events like A New Hope\\, and Return of the Jedi\\, where happy endings continue popping up again and again. I'm not saying that that's a bad storytelling element: I personally love A New Hope and The Last Jedi. But if that sort of repeat scenario happens again\\, as it did in The Force Awakens (also an extremely good movie)\\, the creators of The Last Jedi would be leaving the storytelling with too few loose ends to tie up in Star Wars: Episode IX. In addition\\, a lot of the audience would be rather bored with the \\\"good-guys-always-winning-despite-the-fact-that-they-are-completely-outmatched-by-the-opposing-force\\\" scenario. \\n\\n    We should not trash this kind of story. It's a great story.","true":true}
