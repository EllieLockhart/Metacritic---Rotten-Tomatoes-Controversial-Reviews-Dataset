Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had to give it 5 stars to balance out the 0 star reviews. What I enjoyed about this movie was how it felt. The chemistry between Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley was explosive (broke a couple of powerful things in half). The messages in the film were also very powerful. Kylo Ren says something to her about destroying the past to be who you really are and this story did destroy the past because it was about something deeper\\, moving away from the formula of a straight fight. Don't destroy what you have\\, save what you love (paraphrasing Rose). We live in a time where we need to act on that message. Who are the good guys really when both sides are just blowing each other up and the arms dealers are profiting? The message might not resonate with some\\, but what about Carrie Fisher's final appearance? The exchange between Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher was touched my heart. I miss the characters from the original but felt I got to see them in all of their glory up to the final moments. The best Jedi mind trick ever from the Jedi master himself\\, Luke Skywalker. And a ridiculous force move by Princess Leia. She'll always be a princess to me \u2665\ufe0f.","true":true}
