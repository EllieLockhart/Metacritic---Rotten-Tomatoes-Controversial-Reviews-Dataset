Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi has impressive technical effects and cinematography\\, and shows Rian Johnson is a compeling director\\, despite its narrative choices and plot twist are left to be desired\\, but are retroactively redeemed because of The Rise of Skywalker's nerve to correct the previous' narrative flaws.","true":true}
