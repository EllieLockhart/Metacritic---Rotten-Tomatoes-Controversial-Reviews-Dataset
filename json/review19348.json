Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's one of the worst movie that I have ever seen.  There are enough plot holes that a Death Star can fit through\\, and it was grossly Disneyfied. This movie is a about SJW's propaganda\\, hence absolutely horrid writings and bad characters development. I'm a big Star Wars fan since the early 80's\\, and this movie basically slapped me in the face.","true":true}
