Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Not perfect\\, but thrilling and enjoyable. Unique flavor on the Star Wars universe\\, while still maintaining the charm and emotion that are its signature. Several incredibly satisfying moments\\, several scenes that brought me to tears\\, and a few scenes where I cringed because CGI took me out of it.","true":true}
