Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow. All of you bagging on the movie and calling yourself \\\"true fans\\\" are the epitome of The Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons. Before you decide to tell me I don't know all the cannon\\, that I don't understand the magic from the original movies\\, yada yada yada...I have to state I was alive and actually saw Star Wars\/New Hope in the theater in 1977. Meaning\\, I am part of the same fan base that was alive when these movies originally came out. My first viewing wasn't on VHS\\, Laser Disk\\, DVD\\, Blu-Ray or Digitally (so I know how it felt in the 70's and I saw how Star Wars changed the movie landscape and I am in fact\\, a TRUE FAN).\\n\\nThat being said\\, I am sure you will blast me on this and frankly I don't really care. It seems that those of you hating on this move don't see it as an EVOLUTION. Instead you see it as abandoning the \\\"true Star Wars story\\\" and therefore ignoring the \\\"True Star Wars fans.\\\" \\n\\nIt appears to me that you are the same fans that bagged on The Force Awakens for copying A New Hope and now you are mad because The Last Jedi didn't copy Empire. You seem to not be able to let go of your \\\"Theories\\\" over the past years and cannot see that The Last Jedi is TOTALLY DIFFERENT from the other movies and that is what makes it a great movie and even more importantly an AMAZING STAR WARS story. The dialog\\, effects\\, sound\\, etc. were phenomenal. Did it have missteps? For sure. However\\, the growth and story in this movie were fantastic.\\n\\nPull up your britches and go see it again with an open mind instead of being such a judgmental b-hole. I doubt you can do that but maybe upon repeat viewings you can see The Last Jedi for what it is...an EVOLUTION on the story and not a carbon copy to please you and your theories. \\n\\nBring on the haters!","true":true}
