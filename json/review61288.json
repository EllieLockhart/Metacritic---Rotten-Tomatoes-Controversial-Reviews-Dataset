We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"SPOILER ALERT! This is the best game that I have ever played. No other piece of media has made such a deep emotional impact on me. The storytelling was masterful; captivating and immersive the entire way through. Yes\\, it was really emotionally painful\\, but that's what I expected and wanted. Actually\\, it far surpassed expectations. I'm sure like many others\\, from the trailers and teasers that came out before the game\\, I had guessed that Dina was going to be the one who was murdered by some group\\, and the game was going to be Ellie and Joel going on a revenge mission together. I was taken by complete surprise that it turned out to be Joel who was murdered. Big\\, huge\\, humble props to the developers for pulling that off. I am a young woman with a father that reminds me of Joel\\, so playing Ellie and watching his death hit me really hard. Having so much emotional investment in Joel made Ellie's anger over his murder so much more compelling. Then they devoted so much time to Abby's side\\, and to her character\\, that I empathized with her side of the story as well. As much as we love Joel\\, he did stop the development of a vaccine that could have saved so many lives and could have turned the apocalypse around. On top of that\\, he murdered Abby's father (and a lot of other people) to do it. There's so much pain in this story\\, as there should be.\r\rI also really appreciated the inclusion and diversity of the cast. Both main characters were badass women\\, and they were badass in their own ways. Thank you for giving us Abby's biceps (I hope she is able to get them back someday). My one and only complaint is that I wish they would have called out Owen more for being such a piece of ****\r\rThe graphics\\, audio\\, and gameplay were all astounding. There was so much detail in every level and the landscape felt very real. The audio amplified the emotions at every point. The enemies were terrifying. My boyfriend pointed out that making the flashlight invisible to zombies made the dark and scary parts all the better\\, because it could be creepy without taking away the players' ability to see.\r\rAmazing game all around.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
