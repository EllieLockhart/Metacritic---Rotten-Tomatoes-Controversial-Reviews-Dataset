Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film was the most disappointing film of all time. The first film of the new trilogy was a remake the first films and I enjoyed it\\, it was not to be taken too seriously and set up the rest of the series. This director then proceeds to do what Luke Skywalker does with the Lightsabre he was handed and throws it away. He then seems to stick two fingers up at the core audience of those who were kids when the first trilogy came out or even kids when the second came out and instead of us finally getting to see Luke Skywalker Jedi Master\\, we get this grumpy old caricature of god knows who. The whole film is just wrong. I won't spoil what happens\\, but the franchise ended there and then for me. This was a director who did not know his audience and made a film for others\\, but they aren't the ones who want to see this rubbish\\, and they won't be back for the next one.","true":true}
