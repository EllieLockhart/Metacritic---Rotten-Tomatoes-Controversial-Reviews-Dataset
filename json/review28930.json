Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really disappointed with this film. Just - I understand why some people love it\/like it. However\\, I'm convinced that's due to they want to have a good time and treat these films as the theme park rides they are becoming at Disneyland. Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back are part of a lexicon of films that are almost sacred. When they were released there was nothing like them at the time\\, now films mimicking them or trying to be like them are encouraged. I'll say The Last Jedi took risks\\, but risks that felt inorganic to the fabric of Star Wars lore or what we knew of the characters and took a lazy plot with terrible subplots to make this film really tedious. Mark Hamil is good in it\\, but the Luke Skywalker in this film is a betrayal of the character presented in the original trilogy. Characters\\, elements and questions set up in The Force Awakens are basically killed\\, ignored or the answers are terrible and lazy. Basically\\, it's a lazy film that tries for something new in regards to story ideas and humor\\, but is really boring and a I got a headache from rolling my eyes too much. If you see it\\, expect the worst and maybe you'll like\/love it. However\\, if you expect something along the lines of Star Wars\\, Empire or Rogue One prepare to leave disappointed.","true":true}
