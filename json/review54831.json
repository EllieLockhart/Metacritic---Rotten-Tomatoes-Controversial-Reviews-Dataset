Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought to myself\\, great another chapter in the Star Wars Saga! This movie is going to be good.  After watching the international trailer a handful of times I was very excited.  Well.... to be completely honest this move was a huge disappointment in my view. Though the movie is visually stunning\\, the plot leaves holes bigger then the Grand Canyon which leaves viewers questioning the entire Star Wars Universe. I left the theater wanting more from the story and its characters. This movie lacked character development and if I were Mark Hamill I would be upset  as well\\, for they way they portrayed  Luke.  I had hoped Kylo Ren would descend deeper into the Dark side and become a true villain\\, but he is portrayed as the biggest cry baby in the  galaxy \\, who seemingly becomes more annoying as the film continues on. I don't want to spoil the movie\\, but I didn't appreciate the fact that General Lea Organa uses the force and seemingly looks like Jean Grey from X-men.  Yes\\, I know it sounds crazy\\, but it happened. Though Star wars usually does a good job not killing off characters\\, that cant be said for this movie\\, everybody and their mother were dying off. Any how\\, see Star Wars at your own risk\\, but If I knew what I know now\\, I would wait for Netflix.","true":true}
