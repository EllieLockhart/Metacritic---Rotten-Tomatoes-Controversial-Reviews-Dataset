Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This probably falls alongside the prequels for me. It just feels like they're cutting everything they didn't like from TFA and starting fresh. They cam deny all they want but this is what they're film has made a lot of us feel. Tone is all over the place\\, obvious jokes and cracks are thrown in in the middle of a very tense or serious scene. Don't get me started on the casino slash Harry potter land...in the end this could have been a better movie if disney would have approved a coherent story and hired one director for all three films. I have seen all star wars films 2 or 3 times upon release since episode 1....yes even the prequels...this one im done with. At the moment im not even excited for 9. Call me dramatic if you want haha but it's the truth.","true":true}
