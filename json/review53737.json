Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good action\\, great special effects and good acting are brought down by a lenghty plot and inconsistent pacing. During the first third of the movie\\, although scenes were succeeding each other\\, you feel like the story isn't moving forward at all. Mark Hamill did well for his return as a hopeless Luke Skywalker\\, even if some of his actions might feel out of character. That can be forgiven : you can't predict what effects tragedies have on people behavior. Once again\\, Adam Driver proves his range with his great portrayal of the still convoluted Kylo Ren. On the downside\\, John Boyega's talent feels wasted in a pointless\\, boring and long story arch that should've been written off the script. Overall\\, The Last Jedi was a good moment\\, full of mildly unexpected turns and cheesy sequences\\, but still a fun episode in the whole spectrum of Star Wars movies. As the second installement of a trilogy\\, it's doesn't come near Empire\\, while still outperforming Attack of the Clones by a mile.","true":true}
