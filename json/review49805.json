{"101487":199770,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-28","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Yes\\, I am a new user who created this account to rate this mockery of a Star Wars movie. No\\, I am not a troll\\, a hater \\, a white supremacist\\, or part of the \\\"conspiracy group\\\" to bring down Disney. And yes\\, I think the \\\"critics\\\" and the raving idiots giving this movie 5 stars are simple-minded\\, half-wits. First let me start off with the fact that I am more of \\\"The Hobbit\\\" and \\\"Lord of the rings \\\" girl\\, however I love Star Wars\\, and especially the The Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith. I was not born when the original triology was released\\, but I found it to be mesmerizing. I don't really understand why the prequels are so despised by some fans since they told the story of how everything started\\, including the journey of Anakin Skywalker from a Jedi to a Sith. I loved Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kanobi and Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. They both had depth and convincibility that the new characters lack in many respects. I even enjoyed Darth Sidius (the Lord Sith) manipulative and conniving ways\\, he knew just what to say and when to say it in order to bring the worst in Anakin.\\nThe Force Awakens was passable\\, however I hated that they so quickly got rid off Han Solo\\, but I was excited at the promise of Luke Skywalker in the upcoming movie. What a mistake on my part...Instead of getting the Grand Master Jedi\\, who could have replaced Yoda as the leading Jedi\\, I lived to see this marvelous character milk a walrus\\, drink green milk \\, and catch the fakest looking fish possible. Then we have to listen to the stalest\\, most forced \\, copy cat dialogue between Rey and Luke. With Rey trying to talk Luke into training her so she can convert Rylo( another idea borrowed from previous Star Wars films). Then we witness Rey's 5 minute lesson on how to become a Jedi  when she slices a rock and watches it roll down the cliff breaking the card of the poor frog looking caretakers of the Jedi Temple( one of the few comedic moments I found funny). Rey becomes so powerful that she even defeats her teacher Luke - totally unbelievable. Then we get the utterly boring and completely illogical space ship chase\\, the made-to look ridiculous general of the First Order and the absolutely annoying\\, condescending\\, arrogant and unlikable Admiral Hux\\, the purple haired lady. The only satisfying thing about her character was when se decided to stay in the mother ship and kill herself in order for the other pitiful bunch of losers to escape (one would think that such an advance ship would have autopilot and would not need anyone staying behind\\, but as I said I was overjoyed to see her go). If only Admiral Hux has told Poe and Finn about her plan\\, there would be no need for the Casino scenes\\, but the \\\"heroic lady \\\"did not want to appear as a martyr or a hero so she kept it all to herself. \\nAnd then we get those stupid looking birds-Porges. They were everywhere \\, in all the scenes\\, even in Chewbaka's spaceship...how did they get there..noone knows. \\nThe Rose character with her ridiculous haircut\\, self righteous attitude and constant preaching made me want to puke...especially the forced kiss with Finn and the\\\" we protect what we love\\\" speech. And let me tell you that I do not believe it for a second that Finnor any other man unless blind and deaf would find this utterly unattractive\\, void of personality abomination of a woman- yes I said it..\\nNow we come to the supposedly ultimate villain Kylo Ren ( since the real Sith and villain Snoke was killed as easy as you chop a mouse). Kylo Ren's angry outbursts made him look like un emotionally unstable\\, almost hormonal mockery of a villain. We are now to believe that this semi-Sith without real knowledge of the Dark side\\, without any composure or will strength is supposed to be the number one Sith in the galaxy- weak\\, very weak and implausible. However\\, when one comes to think about it this parody of a villain might actually succeed because what is left of the resistance are a bunch of losers without manpower or weapons worthy to fight with.\\nAnd lets not forget the puppet looking Yoda who shows just in time to burn the Jedi Temple\\, after which bursts into crazy laughter and mocks Luke Skywalker for caring about the Jedi scripts. \\nLuke Skywalker trying to kill his nephew in his sleep without even talking to him first is totally unbelievable and illogical to his character\\, I would say killing someone in his sleep is low even for a Sith.\\nThe \\\"bold moves\\\" and \\\"twists\\\" are nothing new but exact copies of previous SW films down to the scene when Kylo tells Rey that they should both rule the galaxy and create new order; a scene taken from Revenge of the Sith when Anakin tells Patme exactly the same thing before his fight with Obi Wan. \\nThe end scenes with Leia were cheese and overly optimistic regarding the condition the resistance was in. Even though we know that at the end they will win\\, the characters themselves donot know it and should show more humility and contained hope rather than the sure belief in their success. That is what separates the SW from the likes of flicks like The guradians of the Galaxy. Believability\\, depth and substance over cheap tricks and overly arrogant good guys sure of their success which makes the villains look pitiful and kills the suspense.\\n\\nThe movie is a total mess\\, devout of any feeling or depth\\, the magic is gone buried in forced dialogue\\, illogical sequence of events and totally forced diversity \\, the only ethnic group the \\\"creator\\\" RIan Johnson forgot to include is the pygmy man...what a miss Rian\\, how could you forget the pygmy man?\\nLuke SKywalker needs to come back redeemed. George Lucas must to return. Rian Johnson should not be allowed to direct the Han Solo series\\, otherwise DIsney you are in for a big loss.","true":true}
