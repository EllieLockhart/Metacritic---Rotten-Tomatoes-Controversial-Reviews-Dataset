The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"This is pure art. I don\u2019t necessarily need to be happy with the events that happen in a game\\, movie or series. I was incredibly moved by the story\\, and have never been more invested in a game. And because of how much i care about this game\\, I will try to justify the two big events of the story that alot of people have a problem with. This is a story about hate and loss\\, and I think the choices Naughty Dog took with Joel\u2019s death and letting Abby go\\, was necessary for the story. The death of Joel put Ellie on a revenge mission\\, and will kill anything that gets in her way. I think that is completely understandable\\, and shows her incredible loss. She goes on a journey of hate\\, and only cares about getting to Abby\\, and therefore not showing any emotion other than hate towards her fellow Wolves. Abby lets Ellie live when they met at the theatre\\, and therefore shows that she is willing to let go of her hate in order to stop the killing. Also getting to play as Abby\\, seeing her humanity\\, and symathizing with her\\, is a fantastic part of the game. After that\\, Ellie and Dina lives quite happily on the farm with JJ\\, but Ellie still has severe problems with Joel\u2019s death\\, and has a firm belief that killing Abby will make it stop. Dina knows the loss of what a journey of blind hate can make you lose\\, woth Jesse getting killed. She understands that it is not worth it\\, and has perspective on what is important. Ellie has not yet realized that fully. She finds Abby on the pole\\, and is kind of paralyzed when seeing her so weak. When getting memories of Joel\\, she is enraged and wants to fight\\, and has the opportunity to kill Abby. When getting another image of Joel\\, she stops. I think this is because she realizes how much she has lost\\, with Joel\\, Jesse\\, Dina and JJ because of this pure hate. There is simply no point anymore\\, she figures out that it wont resolve anything. It will only create more suffering. It is sad that alot of people had to die by her hand before she realized\\, but i dont think it makes the story or the game bad. My perception is that Ellie was clouded by hate for very long\\, and with time and distance\\, she subconsiously left that hate behind her\\, and when she finally had the chance\\, her hate was gone. I don\u2019t feel good or fulfilled by the ending\\, but it makes sense. This game moved me and made me think\\, that is what i think great art is about.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
