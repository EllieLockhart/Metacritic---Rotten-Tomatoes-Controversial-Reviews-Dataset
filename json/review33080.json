{"101487":170887,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2019-07-27","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Stupid written. The chase segment with everything in there. The casino planet and the salt planet\\, everything was just stupid. It tops with some sacrifice that breaks the whole star wars universe with hyperdrive as a weapon. Luke dies a pathetic death. To be a Jedi aint anything special. Anyone can pick up a \\\"lasersword\\\" and be one. It seems. I really dident like this movie.","true":true}
