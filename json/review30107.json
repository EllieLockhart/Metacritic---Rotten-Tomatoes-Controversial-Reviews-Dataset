Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sadly does the same as episode VII\\, takes a great franchise and tries to eliminate the past storyline to kill off the characters without any sort of resolution. A sad day for fans. Please involve whoever made\/wrote the marvel movies in next projects.","true":true}
