Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After seeing Rise of Skywalker\\, it was even more obvious how absolutely terrible The Last Jedi was ....\\nThe Last Jedi was terrible because it didn't draw you into the story\\, so the horrible plot holes and science mistakes were just sooooo blatant and painful.   Gravity Bombs\\, phone pranks\\, etc in just the first few minutes set the bad tone\\, and it only got worse.\\nYou can just skip this one in the series ... Episode 7 feeds into Episode 9 just fine\\, and you just ignore Episode 8 completely.","true":true}
