Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a slap in the face to the lore of the franchise. None of the characters behave as you would expect them to behave based on the previous films. The progress that was established in episode 4-7 are erased. Plot holes drive what very little story there is here forward. It is an unbelievable\\, forced mess that makes no sense within its own universe.\\n\\nMuch has been said about how Episode 4 was saved in editing. Sequences that made no sense were moved. Motivations changed. Lines added to establish elements of the universe. Create a consistent tone\\, flowing narrative\\, etc. Episode 7 was a thief. It took the arc of episode 4 and mixed in plot sequences from later scenes\/movies then continued on with the episode 4 arc to end the movie. It was\\, like 4 originally\\, poorly constructed and suffered as a result. This movie\\, episode 8 was faced with the challenges of establishing elements in the universe again\\, while laying the foundation of a plot that could progress in a way that wasn't needless reveals of backstory. This movie was unlike to be good in the first place. Unfortunately it mostly fails to even do that. In fact it takes the formula of using the episode 4 arc with elements of the other films spliced in and tuns it up 10 fold. The result is a mess that\\, like episode 7 goes no where. It is the nightmare of pre-edit episode 4 on steroids.","true":true}
