Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Filled with familiar images this is still not the SW movies from our childhood. It has the unenviable job of balancing a new story with the integration of iconic characters that have aged-out of the story telling. The movie stands well on it's own\\, feeling less dependant on a sequel than it's predecessor. Very much worthy of it's SW moniker. ","true":true}
