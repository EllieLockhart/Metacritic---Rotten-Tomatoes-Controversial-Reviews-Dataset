Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first time I watched Star Wars: The Last Jedi I wasn't sure how much I liked it.  Some of the plot points and direction did confuse me a bit.  I first watched it on Dec. 15th so I have had some time to sit and think about it.  Overall\\, I really enjoyed the film.  It takes bold character and story directions that you don't really see in any other Star Wars film.  Were they not what I expected or hoped for going into the theater? Yes.  But that certainly doesn't make it \\\"the worst Star Wars ever\\\" or \\\"worse than Attack of the Clones\\\" as many amateur critics have been saying online.  That just means I let myself down with my own expectations. The director and writers don't personally owe me a Star Wars movie.  Overall\\, a visually stunning movie.  Definitely the 'prettiest' Star Wars film.  The story does drag in some areas and the humor is a little too pervasive for my taste.  But\\, overall\\, a decent addition to the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
