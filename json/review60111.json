Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"People who play Souls-Borne games are used to getting the middle finger and a \\\"GiT GuD\\\" when it comes to a difficulty setting.  It's something of a hot topic recently (surprisingly) and it's something that people who were unable to overcome simply didn't like about the games. That being said those games are better for it and arguably could be ruined if ever implemented.  TLOU2 another one of those games.  There is a difficulty setting for game-play but there are no difficulty settings in this game or in real life for processing mental and emotional trauma.  It seems like the majority of these reviews are from people having trouble at the latter.  This is strange though because games like Hellblade and Celeste have done well on here.\r\rGrief is a potent emotion that I would never wish on anyone.  If not under control it will ravage someone\\, sometimes completely changing the person you thought you knew.  This is something that is as hard to watch in real life as it is in this game.  We saw what it turned Joel into in the first game but we never saw how.  In movies you just have to watch as someone goes through this; in video-games you're in the drivers seat and you are far more exposed.  This is where Naughty Dog shines and they do an immaculate job across the board.  I felt the death of Joel hard\\, I felt Ellie's grief\\, I even felt Abby's grief but I didn't think I would be able to forgive her.  There is one moment at the end of the game that is so easy to miss but hits so hard. As Ellie holds Abby's head under water trying to drown her she has a brief but powerful flashback.  In this 2 second flashback Ellie remembers the very moment she was ready to forgive the only person besides Abby that took everything away from her.  It's after this moment that Ellie realizes the is done and lets Abby go.  Its not a happy ending and it was not something I would call fun\\, but rather fulfilling.  TLOU starts as a story about curing all the zombies but changes at the very end with Joel murdering everyone in the hospital and ruining the chance of a cure.  TLOU2 starts as a cliche murder revenge plot but ends up with Ellie ultimately letting everything go.  In hindsight this is something we could have expected.\r\rThis is a must play game for me across the board with one caveat. Not everyone can handle losing a loved one\\, they may even play video-games to avoid this.  If that is the case this game may not be for you.   It doesn't make sense to buy a game after seeing the leaks and knowing you're not going to like it.  Its the equivalent of going to a restaurant and ordering a salad even though you wanted a steak and writing a bad yelp review.  It would seem there are a lot of Karens playing video-games nowadays.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
