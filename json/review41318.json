Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is an epic fail!  Rian Johnson had an opportunity to do something great and decided to write the script in crayon.  The plot\\, character development and continuity was horrible.  We learned nothing from this movie.  All of the questions from the awesomely directed Force Awakens were not answered.  This movie is more stand alone then Rogue one was and definitely not as good. I gave the movie 2 stars for some fun moments.  Other than that this movie and starship literally run out of gas and crash and burn.  So disappointed.  I really hope JJ can save what he started and give us an epic ending.","true":true}
