Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"New characters that were well dressed. That's it! The writers of this should be banned from ever touching star wars again. They've destroyed old and new character storylines that had soo much more potential. Its a basic bottom of the barrel at the cheap DVD bin movie that will be forgotten. Get George Lucas back onboard!!!!!!! Disney.... You should be ashamed of yourself! Enjoy your big paycheck! You robbed the world!","true":true}
