Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can never forgive this one. It ruined a franchise I've been following since I was 12 years old. I probably enjoyed about 70 percent of the film\\, but so hated the other 30 percent that it completely destroyed the experience. The entire Canto Bight sequence - about 20 percent of the movie - could have been cut out and you never would have known the difference. Since the movie is about 40 minutes too long anyway\\, this would have been a drastic improvement. And what was done with Luke Skywalker's character was truly tragic. A poorly written and poorly thought-out movie with consequences for the franchise that are already playing out with fans ignoring franchise follow-ups.","true":true}
