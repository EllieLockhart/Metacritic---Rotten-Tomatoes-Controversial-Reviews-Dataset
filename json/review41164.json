Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie has four scenes that I would like to see again\\, but\\, overall\\, I disagree with nearly every choice that was made story-wise and character-wise. As a life-long Star Wars fan\\, this movie is not for me. I really wanted to like this movie and I know that a lot of people worked really hard on it\\, but this is a Disney movie with about as much heart as one of the soulless Pirates of the Caribbean sequels and as much intelligence as a Transformers film. I don't want to go into spoilers\\, but it's barely passable as an action\/adventure film and as a Star Wars movie\\, it fails miserably.","true":true}
