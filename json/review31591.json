Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much potential\\, so many cool ideas. Horrible execution. Too much Disney and PC\\, not enough common sense. Did NOT live up to the hype from The Force Awakens or Rogue One. Very disappointed.","true":true}
