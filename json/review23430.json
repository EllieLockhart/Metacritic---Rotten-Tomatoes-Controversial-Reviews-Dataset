Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved Rogue One and The Force Awakens\\, but this movie did not follow suit.  The humor was awkward (not funny) and plot was lacking  I really wanted to like it but ultimately a big disappointment.","true":true}
