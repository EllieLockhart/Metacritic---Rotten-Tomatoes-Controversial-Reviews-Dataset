Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Even if it was not Star Wars\\, the effort to create a movie is a catastrophic blunder. We are talking\\, \\\"Cutthroat Island\\,\\\" level of bust. The only answer to all the questions you are left with\\, which is all of them\\, is if Ryan Johnson has ever seen a movie or read a book? There is no hyperbole in honestly questioning the limitation of Johnson's grasp on cinematic technique and art. It is truly baffling how a movie was produced that contained limited to no development in any character arc\\, does not have a plot\\, ignores major protagonists\\, contains no theme\\, is slowly paced\\, destroys previous character arcs\\, lacks any sense of its audience\\, and finishes by sticking it to all level of fans. You walk out of the theater amid a bunch of booing and or the silence of disbelief.","true":true}
