Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a great film. Don't care what the audience scores say\\, I loved it. Sad that Luke had do go but at least his end didn't feel rushed like Han solos was. Definitely can say I loved this movie\\, but I guess star wars fans will be star wars fans. All who cling on too tightly to the past with out excepting the new story. I had my doubts at first because of the way force awakens was\\, but I have to say the last jedi was amazing and should still be loved as much as the original trilogy not compared. Although hopefully they follow up with a LUKE SKYWALKER solo movie. Hopefully closing the gap between Episode VI and VIII. Mark Hamil is such an underrated actor and deserves his shot. Please give Hamil his wish is all I'm asking Disney. I'd pay to see a Luke skywalker movie Wink! Wink! I'm sure alot of fans will agree.","true":true}
