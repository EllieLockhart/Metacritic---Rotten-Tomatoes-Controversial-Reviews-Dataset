Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie felt more disappointing because of the expectations of a Star Wars Movie everything TFA set up is gone. Seriously felt like the Iron Man 3 Mandarin trick. In the end it was a good movie not great. The way that it left Rey and Kylo Ren makes me hopeful. ","true":true}
