Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie came off like a spoof of Star Wars. Utterly incoherent. Pathetic attempt. The kids sitting behind me at the end asked out loud 'Is Luke dead?' when he disappears into a puff after straining himself during meditation. What utter nonsense.","true":true}
