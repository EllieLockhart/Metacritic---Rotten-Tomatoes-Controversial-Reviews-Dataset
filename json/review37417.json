Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The reality is that this film is a weak entry to the Star Wars franchise\\, and no matter which way you want to slice it\\, this film is just not that good. There are so many problems with the clumsy and disjointed plot\\, cringe-inducing exposition\\, and failure to develop the characters in a meaningful and intriguing way. Jokes inserted in moments that are supposed to be emotional or tense that deflate the whole thing\\, and moments that are supposed to be emotional that are unintentionally comical and eyebrow raising. The only reason you should see this film is if you\\, like myself\\, consider yourself a big Star Wars fan and feel a need to have seen the movies for the sake of completion. If you don't really care that much about Star Wars as a franchise\\, then do yourself a favor and skip this one.","true":true}
