Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi blazes its own path in the Star Wars saga. The result is a movie with several great character arcs and tension throughout. It's not replacing Empire as the best sequel in the franchise\\, but it holds its own with the franchise's best films.","true":true}
