Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was awesome! It is quite different than other Star Wars movies but I like that. It gave a good amount of screen time to the old characters while mostly focusing on the new ones which is nice. The visuals were amazing and the battle scenes were epic and fun to watch. I recommend this movie to every Star Wars fan. It is easily up there as one of the best movies in the series. ","true":true}
