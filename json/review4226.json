Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By far the worst movie I saw for continuing the SW story.  I still can not believe how Luke's character was written.  To become a bitter old man turning his back on the Jedi ways was just too much (and having him toss his lightsaber away just set the tone for the whole movie as being non-canon).","true":true}
