Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete disregard for the iconic lightsaber\\, flat and disturbingly childish characters\\, in some cases copied and pasted from the earlier films Choppy story telling\\, and a new low for one of our favourite characters from the original trilogy. If you don't watch films to be invested in them\\, this is for you.","true":true}
