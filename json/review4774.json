Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Completely ruined Star Wars.  My 4 year old commented how it's not the same without Luke Skywalker or Chewy.  This movie was a major step backwards serving the fan base\\, both old and new. Killing Han Solo was hard.  Losing the entire point of the Skywalker lineage is a breaking point that can't be salvaged.  My children don't want SW toys because they don't connect to the new barrage of characters.  Completely undeveloped and rushed writing\\, much like the DC universe.","true":true}
