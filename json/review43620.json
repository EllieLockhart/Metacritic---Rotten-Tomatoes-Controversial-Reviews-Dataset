Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This wasn't the Luke that I remember\\, and that we witnessed going thru hardships and growing in the force and in the end redeeming his father and saving the galaxy. Disney missed out on a huge opportunity here. Smh..... It looked great and was entertaining. So 2* only.","true":true}
