Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very disappointing. Visually stunning movie\\, but very disrespectful to what came before. Nothing wrong with moving forward to the next generation\\, but do it with class.Folks will say that our expectations were high\\, that is wrong\\, this is Star Wars\\, if you can't handle the expectations then stay out of it.","true":true}
