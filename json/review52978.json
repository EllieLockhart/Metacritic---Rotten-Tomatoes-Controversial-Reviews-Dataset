{"101487":104896,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":5,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a 40-something\\, I came in right after the initial wave of Star Wars Mania and I'm old enough to abhor the Prequels. The Force Awakens was a restart of the franchise\\, and was a step in the right direction in terms of righting the ship... but it was reliant on ep VIII. I knew it at the time\\, and I hope others did\\, as well.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi delivers. It picks up all the pieces\\, wipes off the smudges that TFA marked on the franchise\\, and moves us all forward. Expositional dialogue was needed and delivered; Kylo and Snoke's first conversation was plainly speaking to all the fanboy critics\\, much as Kylo's declarations later in the film: we're all moving on. Let go of the past. Quit expecting to see the old EU on screen\\, and enjoy what's being put out there... because it's some good stuff.\\n\\nNone of the flaws in the film (and yes\\, there are some!) bother me to the point where I'd drop a full star away from what I'd wedge between ESB and R1 as the top-3 Star Wars films. You'll get some Marvel-esque humor mixed in (this may turn some people off) and you'll get a healthy dose of homage\/throwback without feeling like this is the same movie you've seen before. You'll see an expanded view on the Force and the mechanics thereof that are usually relegated to television shows and novels. No\\, you aren't bogged down with midichlorians and specific powers\\, but there's definitely a more intimate look at the Force and how its \\\"users\\\" interact with it. \\n\\nExpect some fun\\, expect some geekery\\, expect some magic\\, expect more 'war' in your Star Wars.\\n\\nRian Johnson delivers a film that moves us all forward in a satisfying way. This film covers a LOT of ground\\, and sets us up nicely for ep IX. Now it's up to (rumored?) JJ to finish what he started. Please\\, Mr. Abrams\\, please... be bold\\, be daring\\, and give us the finale we deserve!","true":true}
