Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars Episode VIII - The Last Jedi brings the ingenuity\\, shock\\, spectacle\\, emotion\\, and investment that we all want. Rian's eye\\, combined with astonishing use of color and cinematography\\, provide some of the most striking visual moments of the franchise. While one of the brief storylines in the middle is lacking\\, it still ends up giving unexpectedly informed and grounded insights on topics we don't often see covered. There's also an underlying humor and with that work very well\\, and the performances are full of life. How lucky are we to be getting a new picture into this galaxy every year??","true":true}
