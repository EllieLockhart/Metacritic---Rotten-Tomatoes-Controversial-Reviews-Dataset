Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They literally ruined Star Wars some of the main characters were killed off without ending that actually make sense... Star Wars 7 might aswell not took place because this destroys all the significance of the events that took place in the last film.... sooo much is unexplained... and WHY THE FUCK are they joking while there about to all die by the dreadnaught.. jokes were just bad... nothing made sense and some guy down the street could have made a better movie... my disappointment couldn't be higher I HAD A HARD TIME NOT FALLING ASLEEP THATS HOW BORING THE STORY IS NOW","true":true}
