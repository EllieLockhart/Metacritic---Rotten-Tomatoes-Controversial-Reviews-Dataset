I dont care about black characters\\, homosexual\\, bisexual\\, or whatever sexuality the character has. BUT I care about logical motivation. There is a lot of illogocal actions. the motivation is a little bit understandable\\, but the forced subverting the expectations\\, just to shock the player. subverting the expectations DOES NOT mean good storytelling. they also forced another character in the spotlight\\, which doesnt work just because of the prequel. If you want to tell such a story\\, start a brand new story with cameos from the the prequel character.\r\rMy Score:\r1 points for the graphics\r\r1 points for the atmosphere\r\rand still 1 point for the gameplay because i dont dislike it\\, but its a disapointment. they could made it so much better\r\runluckily when your game doesnt offer much except mediocre gameplay you must have your strength in storytelling\\, and in TLOU 2 offers a very weak\\, disappointing\\, forced story.\r\rI wished i would like it. Naughty dog was besides CD project red one of the developers i always trusted with a high quality product. but now i am disappointed and sad. I hope i dont get disappointed by CD Project red later this year.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
