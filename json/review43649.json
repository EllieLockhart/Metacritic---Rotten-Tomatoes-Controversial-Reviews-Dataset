Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this was pobably the last star wars that I will sit through. There were many problems with this movie. The humor took all of the tension out of some pretty big scenes. Many characters were not developed fully and were killed off for no reason. Too many unbelievable\\, and convenient escapes from danger.  Pacing was off.  The whole movie felt pointless\\, and really disappointing as a whole.\\n\\nThe fight scenes were cool and Kylo and Rey were incredible! Mark hamill was great\\, but they completely ruined Luke Skywalker.","true":true}
