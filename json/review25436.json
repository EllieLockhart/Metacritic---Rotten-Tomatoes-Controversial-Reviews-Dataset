Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"No original ideas - very repetitive of past films. Disney humor. Numerous plot holes. Very obvious that all of the new Star Wars movies have very little care for plot or character development and are just being made to get money using the popular franchise.","true":true}
