Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a supurb film. It was a little more intelligent than other SW films in the series. Aside from a few deciscions that seem odd and a little drawn out\\, this movie fits perfectly into the SW lore of the Skywalker saga.","true":true}
