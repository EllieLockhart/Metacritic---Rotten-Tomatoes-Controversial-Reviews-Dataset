Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Although there were some elements that were good\\, specifically the acting of Mark Hamill\\, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver\\, and the new creatures were cool to watch\\, the movie falls flat dramatically. \\n\\nAlthough the film makes it seem as though things of major consequence are going down\\, and could go down\\, the things that are happening actually only affect the CGI background characters. Leia not dying when she should have told the audience that no major deaths were to be expected this movie. Yes Luke dies at the end\\, but it was anti-climatic when it turned out he \\\"force powered\\\" himself to death. The fact he doesn't actually duel Kylo Ren was them taking away the biggest moment of the movie for a suprise reveal which was lame and uncalled for. \\n\\nThe story lines that were introduced in episode 7 also have little tangible impact on the actual story line\\, the Knights of Ren are only indirectly referenced\\, and Rey's parents\\, who we have been led to beleive are important (if not to the world but to Rey)\\, are just low life junkies and we are told to essentially forget about them. If so why were we asked to think about them in depth in TFW! \\n\\nHorrible movie from a movie lovers prospective\\, and unholy treason to a star wars fan.","true":true}
