Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I still can't believe that there are no checks and balances in place at Disney or Lucas Film to prevent such a train wreck from entering production. The number of plot holes is insane and the blatant disrespect for the lore of the previous 7 movies is mind blowing. How can such terrible writing be approved by anybody?  Beloved characters get mutilated beyond recognition and killed off to make space for the bland and badly written new ones\\, the plot doesn't make any sense at all\\, the forced humor doesn't fit into the movie and feels awkward\\, we have to sit through \\\"side quests\\\" that take 30 minutes of screen time and don't go anywhere\\, Rian Johnson actively destroys most of the mysteries of The Force Awakens and we get Feminism and SJW ideology force fed to us. What was delivered is an insult. An insult to the audience's intelligence and an insult to the original trilogy and it's characters. I personally refuse to accept TLJ as canon. Disney\\, you lost me...perhaps forever.","true":true}
