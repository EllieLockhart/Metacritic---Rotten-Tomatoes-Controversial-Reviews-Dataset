Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The force awakens left me surprised and very excited for the next movie. The exciting new story and almost flawless integration of old starwars themes with new story and new characters was exceptionally done. The Last Jedi on the other hand felt like the story was going no where. Many of the characters from the Force Awakens were not developed\\, to many new characters that did not seem to fit in or just weren't necessary. \\nThe film could have taken the Force Awakens strong foot hold set by new ideas integrated with old school starwars themselves. But instead it continued to recycle old starwars films and felt like a compilation of Random moments from all the old films. All in all an entertaining movie\\, but a failure to me as a starwars fan. I was worried when I found out they were using a new director\\, and I think the director may be to blame\\, as well as Disney. The film felt like a step back to the 2000's movies. I would have though the lessons were learned from the failure of those films and was so relieved after watching the Force Awakens\\, but now I feel like I'm back in the theater watching the clone wars feeling embarrassed to be a starwars fan. Just like how I felt when Carie Fisher was blown out of the space ship\\, and magically did not die from the vacuum of space and flew her self back to the ship. The writer\/director should be Embarrassed.","true":true}
