Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's so bad.. The force is turned into some wishy washy magic that can do almost anything. How the fuck is Leia still alive after getting blasted into space? The saying should not be 'may the force be with you' anymore\\, it should be 'may the plot armor be with you.' Token black guy and token asian chick are given a plot just because.. Snoke is a joke\\, Kylo Ren is a joke\\, Hux is a joke\\, Rey is overpowered\\, Chewy is turned into a simple monkey\\, Yoda pops just for a fan service\\, and Luke is obviously fed up with all the bullshit.\\n\\nNot only I regret paying for the movie\\, I wish I could get 2.5 hrs of my life back.\\n\\nStar Wars is dead. Long live Star Wars.","true":true}
