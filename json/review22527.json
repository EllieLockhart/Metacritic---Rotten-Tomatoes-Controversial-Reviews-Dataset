Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let me start out by saying\\, I love starwars. I love starwars so much\\, in fact\\, that I will forgive much more in comparison to what I would forgive in other franchises for. Unfortunately\\, this movie was bit of a mess. The plot was incoherent at points and the movie seemed to be proping itself up on nostalgia and not proping itself up on plot you cared about whatsoever. The characters are shallow and weak (aside from Kylo Ren\\, who's character seems to have the only coherent progression and aim) and the most interesting characters are those from the original trilogy. I hate to say this\\, but the majority of the movie was just bad. No other way to put it. I almost walked out (OF A STAR WARS FILM) when Princess Leia floated like a space witch back to a ship moments after her entire cabin got blown up and then I only stayed because it is star wars. Now\\, all this being said\\, I was impressed by a few scenes and that's why i would give this movie the descriptor of messy. It had all the potential\\, but instead of hitting a ball and getting in base\\, it kept hitting foul balls but still decided to run to first even though it wasn't really allowed to.","true":true}
