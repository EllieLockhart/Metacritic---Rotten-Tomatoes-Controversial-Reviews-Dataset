Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is more about pandering to politically correct\\, progressive notions of gender and racial parity\\, than making a good movie.  Disney is more interested in pandering to women and minorities\\, two cohorts that they have yet to fully exploit with their tied marketing of toys\\, video games\\, Happy Meals and whatever other garbage they can foist upon the brainwashed masses.  This movie is a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
