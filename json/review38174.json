Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The tragedy of this film isn't that it sucked\\, but rather that it's robbed the world of one of the most awesome story lines forever. It's retroactive in its failure in that it drops so many things from episode 7. It goes backwards in ruining older star wars. And it's also bad because it's unrecoverable and it ruins everything from this point on. Aside from that it's riddled with plot hole after plot hole\\, so it doesn't even get points for being an integral movie in and of itself\\, which really should be the bare minimum\\, shouldn't it? There were a few moments to love and it was visually nice in some parts and that's the half star. Everything else is just... Well it's Disney squeezing every penny they can out of a series they know can't fall financially. No quality control with the storyline.","true":true}
