Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie\\, entertaining\\, nice to get more of the Star Wars story\\, but in the end\\, it was an underwhelming experience.  Too much forced humor\\, which was very out of the character of the other movies in the series.  It also felt very choppy\\, like they were trying to fit so much story into the time-frame of 2.5 hours....so much that it felt thin and rushed.","true":true}
