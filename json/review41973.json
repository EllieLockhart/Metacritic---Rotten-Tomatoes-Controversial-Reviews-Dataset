Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie kills the energy charged up from the previous movie. It just tossed out everything that fans were waiting for. I feel cheated. But it's not just nostalgic expectations that hurts this movie. There is so much about this plot that is ridiculous (such as the long space chase scene that makes no sense and feels more like a Star Trek movie plot than a Star Wars one). There are some really good scenes. But I feel cheated watching it. Between this and hearing that there will be no appearances by Princess Leia in the next movie (and my lack of interest in the upcoming Han Solo film which doesn't star Harrison Ford)\\, my enthusiasm built up from The Force Awakens has been depleted.","true":true}
