Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story is very small in scope\\, juxtaposed with a massive film budget. Rian Johnson turned the whole story into a simple and linear McGuffin chase scene. Beyond that\\, the whole idea of the entire Republic being wiped out with just a few planets being destroyed is just lazy. Also lazy is the fact that this minor power (New Order) somehow magically makes and mans endless ships from the region of space that didn't have whole lot of humans and very limited trade (according to canon).  All the while\\, the main industrial centers of the Galaxy with well-established and large economies suddenly just collapse. Whether anyone realizes it or not\\, this is a super lazy attempt to reboot the franchise while hoping no one notices. I noticed. \\n\\nI appreciate the Joseph Campbell philosophy being applied here.  Yes\\, you do need to recreate stories for each generation.  But\\, execution in this movie is horribly lacking.","true":true}
