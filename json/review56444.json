Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The creators of Star Wars have used their platform to convey some important and much-needed messages with this film including but not limiting to (spoilers) letting go of nostalgia when the \\\"good old days\\\" become dangerous\\, idols can let you down as they are flawed humans too\\, everyone is capable of being good just as they are capable of being bad\\, corruption and trauma can mislead those still trying to figure themselves out\\, and the importance of saving the ones you love rather than destroying the ones you hate. The cast and their portrayal of beautifully strong and diverse individuals left women and minorities with a sense of belonging and representation. An important story coupled with some of the most breathtaking imagery I've ever seen in my experience with cinema\\, The Last Jedi is a groundbreaking film that is as impactful as it is a stunning work of art.","true":true}
