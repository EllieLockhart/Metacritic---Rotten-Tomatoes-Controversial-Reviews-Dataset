Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the best Star Wars since the Empire strikes back. Did things I didn't expect and kept me on the edge of my seat. I don't understand why it's garnering so much negativity on the internet. It certainly doesn't deserve it. Easily blew The Force Awakens out of the water.","true":true}
