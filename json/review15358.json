Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'll start by saying I loved The Force Awakens and thought Rouge One was ever better.   I couldn't wait to see those moves a second time. The Last Jedi disappoints on so many levels that I don't feel any need to see it again.  There are some very cool special effects for sure\\, but that's pretty much it.  The story is...boring.   It just is.  The character interaction is just strange. Outside of Kylo Ren and Ray\\, the characters don't seem to have a lot of chemistry or memorable scenes. \\n\\nAlso....I can normally or give some latitude to scene when the force is involved\\, because after all it is The Force.  However\\, Leia flying through space and Yoda creating lighting are in my opinion bizarre and not in the spirt of the force\\, I'm not sure I can forgivable those scenes. \\n\\nSadly...I will not be seeing this one again.","true":true}
