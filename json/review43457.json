Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a terrible middle movie for a trilogy\\, and a terrible sequel to TFA. \\\"Subverting expectations\\\" is not an excuse to ignore virtually everything the previous film set up. While some of the \\\"plot twists\\\" were welcome\\, they were way overdone by the end of the film. I appreciate the movie trying not to be a carbon copy of Empire\\, but that is not an excuse for what they ended up doing. I would rather have had a remade Empire than have this movie as an addition to the Star Wars canon.","true":true}
