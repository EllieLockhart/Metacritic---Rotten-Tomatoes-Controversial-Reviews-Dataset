Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After viewing this movie for the second time I've come to the conclusion this is a good \\\"movie\\\" but it is NOT a good \\\"Star Wars Movie\\\". Too much humor\\, wasted 30 minutes on Finn\/Rose story line and wasted Luke Skywalker. Both times i saw this movie it left a bad taste in my mouth. General audience will like this movie\\, but Star Wars fans will hate it.","true":true}
