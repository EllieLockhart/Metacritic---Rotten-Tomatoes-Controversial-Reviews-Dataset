Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"so heres how movie 9 will go for disney star wars .\\n\\nbaddies show up.   is instantly killed by x wing going to light speed\\n\\nnew dreadnought shows up. is instantly killed by x wing going to light speed\\n\\nkylo ren shows up. is instantly killed by x wing going to light speed\\n\\nthe irony? all of those save more lives than not doing it cause rebellion die so much\\n\\nLast Jedi? all those idiot bombers who died at the beginning.   1 x wing suicide light speed could have fixed all that\\n\\nend of last jedi\\, either of those 2 ships they let run out of fuel\\, could have ended it going ot light speed suicidally.\\n\\nforce awakens the star killer base.   1 droid flown ship going to light speed down the center of that things gun.  could end it.\\n\\nwell disney\\, how are you gonna dig yourself out of this hole? cause retconning previous movies you wrote yourself is just making the hole uglier","true":true}
