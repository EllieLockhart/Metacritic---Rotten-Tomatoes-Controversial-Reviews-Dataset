Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It just wasn't good. the Director flat out changed the root of the main character that the Star Wars universe was built around in Luke Skywalker. They wasted having anyone in the original cast take part as they did nothing with them. There are some utter ridiculous moments that are way too far fetched to even suspend disbelief. But my main problem was the complete reverse course on the current characters. The Force Awakens set up great mysterious backgrounds on Rey\\, and Snoke\\, and even Finn\\, that you were excited to see those expanded upon in the follow up. Not only were they not expanded upon\\, they were give lazy to no background and largely dismissed. You know a cup of coffee is real easy to make\\, kind of  hard to completely screw it up to the point of not drinking it\\, I always thought the same of star wars\\, until this mess. This deserves to be shelved with the Prequels\\, redone and lets just imagine it doesn't exist","true":true}
