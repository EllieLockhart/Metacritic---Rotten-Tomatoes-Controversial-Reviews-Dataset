Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is little good to say about this film. As others have said\\, the Ray-Kylo arc is interesting and the only thing that forwards the story within the trilogy. We have Fin's side story that spans almost the whole movie and finishes with exactly 0 effect to the plot (something you learn very early as a storywriter not to do)\\, also there is the forced love story between him and Rose\\, a mechanic\\, we have no sympathy with. Poes narrative of an apparent plot against the rebellion from within the higher ranks that ultimately ends in \\\"Yeah\\, we had a plan all along but decided not to tell anyone\\\" is beyond unbelievable. Then there is the cartoonish overarching plot of two very slow space ships that chase each other. It's like a Pixar's movie scene with a snail race that is played out ironically slow - but this is Star Wars... a movie about War in Space... Then there is a flying Leia Superwoman and a totally obvious rip off of the battle of Hoth from \\\"Empire Strikes Back\\\". So obvious in fact\\, that one character needed to clarify that it is - in fact - salt\\, not snow what we see there. And last but not least the slapstick humor... if you are looking for \\\"Laurel and Hardy in Space\\\" this is for you! From the first scene\\, I knew\\, I would not enjoy this film\\, and I was right. Every single scene\\, every shot\\, needed a joke\\, the only thing missing was a couch and a laugh track and we would have ourselves a sitcom.\\n\\nThis is all very hard critique but don't just take it from me. Go watch \\\"The Rise of Skywalker\\\" and see how J. J. Abrams himself tries his best to right the wrongs of Rian Johnson. How he tries to erase every mistake that has been put in \\\"The last Jedi\\\" and gives fans a dignified end of this Star Wars Saga.\\n\\nJohnson made me lose hope for this franchise which has been restored today\\, two years later.\\n\\nPS: I created this account only to write my critique for this film","true":true}
