Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is my absolute favorite Star Wars movie. It was new on innovative\\, this movie was new and exciting. I know people have said that it isn't \\\"Star Wars\\\"  but what is Star Wars than? Unlike the Force Awakens (which I liked as well)  it was not a new copy of previous films. The character growth and depth was outstanding. The twists were shocking and reveals mind blowing. This movie also really used humor well\\, it was so natural and didn't feel forced at all\\, and it was so funny too. The action scenes and light saber battles were new an innovative. The main theme of this movie which for me was hope was inspiring and profound. The visuals were beautiful and really added to the tone and affect of the plot. This movie was shocking and well written\\, it was gut wrenching at times and hilarious at others. It made me cry and it made me laugh. Rian Johnson did a fabulous job and I wish that he was continuing on for episode nine. 5 stars for me all the way.","true":true}
