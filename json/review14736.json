Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have no idea why people don't like this movie.  I get people don't like change.  But having such temper tantrums over not getting fan theories right or having story lines being finished 2 movies in instead of 3 does not make this a bad movie.  This was an intense dark story that has set the stage for an epic finish.","true":true}
