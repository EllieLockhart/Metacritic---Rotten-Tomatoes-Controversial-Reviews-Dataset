Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had great hopes for this movie. However\\, I felt that I didn't learn anything interesting about the Jedi story or anything else. The stories behind the characters were flat -- nothing special or surprising. It seams that the Star Wars movies have only turned into a superficial franchise offering no depth on storytelling and zero creative imagination -- wondering if it is why the critics score is so different from the audience and fans. And I agree with many of the reviewers\\, it is the worse Star Wars movie ever!","true":true}
