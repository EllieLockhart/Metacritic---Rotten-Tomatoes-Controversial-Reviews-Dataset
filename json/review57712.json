Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"un vrai nouveau star wars avec plein de bonne id\u00e9e mais avec un sc\u00e9nario tr\u00e8s mais tr\u00e8s basique plat et sans int\u00e9r\u00eat. \u00e7a me fait mal au cur de voir un tel gachi sc\u00e9naristique. un entra\u00eenement jedi inexistant\\, un fin et rose qui font un mission inutile\\, et un sacrifice avorte bref rien au final.","true":false}
