Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Holy hell man...\\nDespite some messy ideas\\, Rian Johnson breathes a bold\\, fascinatingly unique breath into the Skywalker saga and\\, with cinematic influences far and wide\\, crafts an epic scaled event worthy enough of its place within the Star Wars universe. It's flawed\\, definitely not perfect: there are pacing issues and some very bizarre moments\\, but it ultimately did not disappoint - & I kinda feel bad for those who felt it did. Unlike The Force Awakens\\, The Last Jedi - while not a direct copy - may go down the same infamous path as Empire afterall\\, shrouded in initial controversy but caught in a divide that will keep this film in conversation for a very long time.","true":true}
