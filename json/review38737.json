Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They absolutely destroyed the spirit of Star Wars with this chapter.  Its a boring and nonsensical journey into not caring about the past and its the first Star Wars movie I won't buy on blu-ray and won't see a second time.","true":true}
