Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Go and watch it\\, so you can see Walt Disney ruins Star Wars universe.\\nThere is so much wrong and weak things\\, like characters and clearly this movie is made by people that doesn't understand the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
