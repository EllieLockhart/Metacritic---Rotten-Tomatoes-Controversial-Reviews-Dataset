Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the visuals are impressive\\, the plot reads more like a study in fan fiction than that of a film charting the future of the star wars universe. However\\, the film is in part redeemed by the performances of John Boyega\\, Kelly Marie Tran\\, and Adam Driver.","true":true}
