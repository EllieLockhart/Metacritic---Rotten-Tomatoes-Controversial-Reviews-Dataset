Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A two and a half hour glorified car chase. Divisive plot aside this film could really have benefited from a cantina scene or two to slow down the pace and allow for some character development. There really was no reason for that purple haired woman to stay on the big star ship!","true":true}
