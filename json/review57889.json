Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a blunder!\\nPaper thin plot. Reveals to the fan that we're completely underwhelming\\, for instance\\, Reys' lineage and back story of Snoke.\\nCompletely destroyed everything that was Luke's character. Brought him back after 40 years\\, just to disgrace the Skywalker name and inexplicalblly dies using the force in a new way. Not to mention the retirement home they kept Luke on because he \\\"felt guilty\\\" of having 1 failed recruit. The very same Skywalker that always called for battle and never wanted to leave his friends facing impending danger. \\nThis actually felt like the SyFy tv version of what was suppose to be a Star Wars movie. \\nLeia can now fly through the vacuum of space with the force which visually looked decent but literally turned her character into Mary Poppins. \\nAdam driver is just a horrible villain. Pitching a tantrum because he can't get his feelings under control. \\nAnd now\\, Lightspeed is now weaponized??? WHAT IN THE MOTHER F-ING SON OF A BITCH. If that were a possibility this whole time\\, why not put a pilot drone on the ship and lightspeed through the enemy ship. \\nNow\\, most people would say\\, \\\"that would make the movie only 10 minutes long\\\". While that is correct\\, that also shows how terrible of a plot this is if the movie could be side stepped by turning left instead of right!\\nNEGATIVE RATING FOR THIS MOVIE ALL AROUND","true":true}
