Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"one of the worst movies I've ever seen. snokes death was so unsatisfying I've had a hard time sleeping the last couple days. To be honest snokes gards should have been able to beat them. Luke Skywalker the most powerful Jedi by this time in the story should have been so strong in the force he should have been wielding 6 lightsabers or something. I'm not sure how it's possible that two kids out of nowhere seem to be the strongest in the universe. people may have hated the prequels but at least they attempted to have depth; there were so many different layers ( the dark side\\, all the different governments and worlds\\, mastering light sabers\\, and so much more) but now it seems they stripped everything away. it's almost like they dumb down Star Wars and they are proud of it. and maybe it is just me but it is 2017 and even if i see a bad star wars movie the lightsaber battles should at least be amazing. why do they look like its the first time ever touching a light saber.","true":true}
