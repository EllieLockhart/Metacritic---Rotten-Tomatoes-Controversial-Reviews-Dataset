Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"On a cubicle wall in the Lucas Film office a photo hung of Luke Skywalker. His face crossed out with red ink. Kathleen Kennedy and her crew wearing T-shirts saying 'the force is female'. What? Jar Jar Abrams proclaimed proudly \\\"this will be the most diverse (cultural marxism for less whites and shitting on them and on men in general) Star Wars ever\\\".\\n\\nFor these type of people SW is a vessel to indoctrinate a new youth into their leftist ideology.\\n\\nIdeologues are as terrible at telling stories as they are humorless\\, because if they were free thinkers they would not be ideologues to begin with.\\nConsequently SW was ruined.\\nAt this point it is secondary how much of that was intentional and how much was to incompetence.\\n\\nThey have declared war on us and will learn that in the end evil always loses. Any win is tempoary until the masses wake up and unless you live under a rock you will know that they have. The 'evil empire' will go down. One more time.","true":true}
