Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely fantastic from beginning to end.. Jaw dropping\\, edge of your seat action during the amazing battle scenes\\, great storytelling. My only non-spoiler gripe (and it is a big one) is that it felt like the end of a trilogy rather than a middle offering (but that doesn't take away anything from the quality of the film). The spoiler-gripe will do for later day.. MVP Luke Skywalker\/Mark Hamill.. Legendary","true":true}
