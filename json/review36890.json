Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was different. I didn\u2019t know if I liked all of the decisions and see some missed opportunities\\, but in the end we got a complex movie that subverted expectations\\, leaves us not knowing where things are headed\\, and gives us a lot to talk and think about. The more I think about the movie\\, the more I enjoy it. There are few movies I ever want to see more than once in theaters\\, especially at that length\\, but I def want to see it again!","true":true}
