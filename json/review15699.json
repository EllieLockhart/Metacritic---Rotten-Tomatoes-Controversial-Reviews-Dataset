Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I LOVED this movie! I\u2019m not sure what \u201call of the hate\u201d and low ratings are about\\, but I enjoyed this movie more than any of the others. There\u2019s great action\\, great comedy\\, and cool effects. What more can you ask for? I hope that people go to see this movie for themselves instead of overreacting to \u201cDisney Haters\u201d because this movie was actually very well written and produced.","true":true}
