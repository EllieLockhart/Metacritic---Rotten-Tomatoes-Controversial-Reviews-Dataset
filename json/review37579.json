Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There is character development everywhere. Seen it twice now just cause I needed to process. There is a good amount of lore that fans of the extended universe will like. I think one reason why people don\u2019t like it is because It\u2019s not spoon feed to them. This is a heavy movie. Lots going on. This makes me excited for the last installment. If you go into it w\/o all the fan theories you\u2019ll be better off and be able to enjoy it more. Planning on seeing it again tonight! #lukeisBAsoshutit!","true":true}
