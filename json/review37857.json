Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"There will be spoilers:A horrible Star Wars movie\\, but to explain why I hated it\\, I must go back to The Force Awakens.First\\, I didn\u00b4t liked the First Order\\, or the status of the galaxy as presented in Ep. 7\\, because it make seems that all Luke\\, Leia and Han did during Ep. 4 to 6 was for nothing.See\\, the heroes are still the Rebels\\, and the evil guys still rules the galaxy (even if unofficially). Anyway\\, some mysteries were introduced: Who is Snooke? Who are Rey Parents? Why did Luke traveled to the planet where the Jedi order was founded?These questions brought hope that in the next episode we would get answers that would make sense to all those elements. There must had a reason for Luke to go specifically to that planet (maybe he was looking for answers\\, for a way to finally bring balance to the galaxy). Why to leave a map\\, if not to be found?  It was as if he was waiting for someone (Rey) to find him\\, so he they could work a solution to balance things once again.Then\\, came Ep. 8. We had the promise of Luke training Rey\\, the origins of Snooke being revealed (the guy as absurdly powerful\\, so\\, from where he came? How was he able to create an army that later destroyed  the Republic?)\\, Rey\u00b4s parents\\, that are shownparting on a spaceship...Firstly there were those horrible and exaggerated jokes\\, then\\, we have a totally out of character Luke. There was no training at all.Then\\, the answers: NONE. It\u00b4s like Rian Johnson just decided  to spit in the fans hopes\\, only for the pleasure of saying : \\\"your theories were all wrong\\\". It is not being creative\\, itis being incompetent. I would not care if the answers were not the ones I expected\\, if he at least had the effort to work on something\\, instead of just killing every plot raised by Ep. 7 with a \\\"This doesn't matter\\, move on\\\"\\, kind of answer. Fans were not expecting Rian Johnson to deliver then just what they wanted to see\\, just to follow the plots that were started in the previous installment\\, instead of simply killingthem off as unimportant details.If not enough destroying the classic characters\\, with which many of us grew up\\, and expected to see doing something great in their departure movies\\, the movie presents many nonsense scenes. The whole casino plot (they were not able to recruit the right person\\, but coincidently a guy able to do the exact thing they needed happened to be in the same cell as Finn and Rose)\\, and many other moments full of plot holes.No nice battles. No knights of Ren. No reason for me to want watch Ep. 9. I think it willbe better for me to write my own version of the story after Ep.6. Of course it will be \\nonly for my own fun (in witch ep 7 and 8 will be only a force vision Luke has shortly after ep. 6\\, about a dark future\\, then he makes sure to act quickly so this nightmare can\u00b4teven come close to happen) \\, then \\, but I think I\u00b4m able to write something well better than this billion milking fanfiction that Disney approved.","true":true}
