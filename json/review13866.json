Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"if this wasnt a star wars movie with already well developed characters\\, it would have been pretty good.  But because we know who Luke Skywalker is\\, as well as other characters\\, it falls short.  they ruined the skywalker legacy and made Luke look like a scared little wimp... Luke deserved better.","true":true}
