Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star wars Episode 1 was better. This movie is a mess of plots as if the writers were playing a jedi video game and \\\"dude\\\" lets do that happened. I went believing the critics but critics either do not understand Star Wars or just blind to a good story. Thats the point it felt like no story\\, no reason to continue. So I do not need to give spoiliers to tell you that Star Wars Episode 8 fails and the exect at disney who approved it should be fired. What a horrible mess.","true":true}
