Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is trash. Everything that happens is decided by pure luck (see bad story telling) Good guys need a magic hacker? They get arrested and thrown in a jail cell with one (even though he's not the hacker they came to the planet to find\\, that could do the one thing they needed done\\, that was apparently so hard to do that only one person in the galaxy could do it) Finn and Rose are about to be executed\\, and\\, through no skill or planning of their own are saved when another ship crashes into the ship their on at the EXACT moment they were about to be shot! Not only that\\, but the ring of storm troopers around them all get killed (or stunned) but our main characters are completely unhurt. Who ever wrote this movie think's we as an audience are stupid. That's two examples from a movie full of dumb ideas\\, blunt and awkward political messages that make characters look stupid. What were they thinking","true":true}
