While the game gets a few points for graphics and the gameplay.. which might be somewhat amusing at times. The story (which is a big part of a game like this) is so painfully awful that it severely hurts the game as a whole. There are no likable characters and the cut-scenes drags on and on for what seems like forever.","true":true}
