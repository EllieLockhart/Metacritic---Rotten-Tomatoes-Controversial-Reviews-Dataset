Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A deeply disappointing film. It seemed to lack coherency in the area of tone; seemingly not knowing if it was a comedy\\, drama\\, love story\\, or action adventure. I'm sure there was incredibly hard working and dedicated individuals behind the scenes and in front of them\\, working tirelessly\\, but sometimes a thing just falls flat and that's okay :)","true":true}
