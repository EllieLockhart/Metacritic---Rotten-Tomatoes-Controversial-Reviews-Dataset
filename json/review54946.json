Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the worst Star Wars installment. From the space-chase context that lasts less than 24 hours\\, to Luke's enological character arc and incongruence to TFA (why the heck was Lors on Jakku with the map? Why was R2 shutdown until the map was presented?)\\, and his ultimate pointless suicide\\, to Rose's last minute crash\\, monologue\\, and cliched kiss\\, to the structurally unproductive Canto Bight tangent and the waste of characters like Admiral Akbar\\, Snoke\\, Luke\\, Leia\\, and DJ\\, to the introduction of new\\, flat characters (Hodo\\, DJ)\\, the Last Jedi offers great examples of how not to write and execute a screenplay. It will be taught as such in MFA programs forevermore! It simply misses the mark in its storytelling and doesn't smoothly fit within the larger trilogy and cannon. All this movie had to accomplish was to create a chemistry between Luke and Rey (pass the torch)\\, one that is mutually beneficial and coherent. It failed and all these other issues are exacerbated by that failure. You can like the movie\\, you can think its funny\\, or unique\\, you can like the characters too (I love the new characters)\\, but you can't argue its good writing\\, by any rational measure. And that is why this movie fails.","true":true}
