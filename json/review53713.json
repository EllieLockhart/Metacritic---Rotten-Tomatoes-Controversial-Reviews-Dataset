Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Gave it 2 stars just for the visual effects.  The plot was a complete joke\\, no plot element made sense or was related to anything in the previous star wars movies.  Best example was all of a sudden Luke is an apathetic hermit because he tried to kill Kilo in his sleep.  This isn't the Luke of the previous movies and no backstory is given to this change.  The first order is massacring people and luke is in hiding.  This made no sense to his original character. Also the ending of him just being a force hologram is never explained or ever talked about any place in books and makes no sense.  The best made up plot device is all of a sudden space ships need fuel ??  Like where did this come from.   I really thought a reasonable path was Kylo + Rey hooking up\\, to finally bridge a void between light + dark\\, something the Jedi never figured out\\, how to allow familes etc...  But again with some horrible writing\\,they just become these weird stock characters again.  Left this movie with no interest in any of these characters\\, I only watched to see what they did to Luke + Leia\\, which was basically the same they did with Han\\, just destroy them in the weirdest way imaginable.","true":true}
