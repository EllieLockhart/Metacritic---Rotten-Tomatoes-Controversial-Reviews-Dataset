Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Weird and extremely odd for a Star Wars film. Felt very forced and tried too hard to be different\\, just doesn't quite fit into the same universe. Had a lot of potential especially with Luke. Very disappointing film!","true":true}
