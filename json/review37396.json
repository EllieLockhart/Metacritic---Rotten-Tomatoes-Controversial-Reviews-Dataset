Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The problem with this movie is quite simple. Whoever wrote the script is a complete moron who gleefully twists and manipulates the plot in order to suit their needs\\, ignores common sense in order to provide... things which can only be described as 'situations'... and seems to have just watched a bunch of old-time saturday morning kids cartoons (and not even good ones) before throwing together a plot and may have even forgotten that the other Star Wars movies\\, possibly even VII\\, existed at all. In short\\, get a five year old to write the next script; it will have fewer plotholes\\, deus ex machina's\\, and letdowns.","true":true}
