Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"As someone who values powerful stories and realistically deep and complicated characters in videogames\\, above gameplay mechanics\\, this game is a masterpiece.

And what happens to those whoAs someone who values powerful stories and realistically deep and complicated characters in videogames\\, above gameplay mechanics\\, this game is a masterpiece. The mechanics are incredible too\\, giving you vast amounts of options on dealing with combat. But above all\\, the story that's being told has to do with overcoming trauma\\, betrayal\\, and attempting to heal. And what happens to those who become blinded by vengeance. It's a very realistic journey Ellie goes on\\, and anytime you deal with this subject matter\\, sad and frustrating encounters will happen\\, such as people you care about deeply dying. This is the violent feral world that has been established in the first game\\, and many people who are upset by these very realistic consequences\\, aka  characters getting hurt or killed\\, are forgetting the world this game is set in. If you trust Neil Druckman and go along with the story that's being told\\, crying when s*** gets sad\\, raging when Ellie is rightly furious\\, falling in love when things get romantic and playful\\, it will only be a more powerful gaming experience. That's what is so good about The Last Of Us\\, how powerful it is\\, and this sequel knocks it out of the park. Plus it is the most gorgeous game I've ever seen. Please go in open-minded\\, and trust the storytelling\\, this game isn't about feeling good and having a rollicking good time\\, it's about the real human experience of living in the wasteland of the apocalypse told through Ellie's eyes\\, and they definitely 100% achieve that.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
