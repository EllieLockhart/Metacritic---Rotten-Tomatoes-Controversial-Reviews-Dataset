Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson not only made an absolute mess of a film\\, but utterly destroyed the Star Wars franchise.  After watching this on opening night\\, I'm flabbergasted at the positive reviews.  Do y'all not Star Wars? Did Johnson even watch a Star Wars film before?  The plot and subplots were terrible\\, the Disney Channel-esque comedy was over the top\\, the absolute ruination of established characters unforgivable.  The Force Awakens was not a perfect SW film\\, but it left hope that in two years episode VIII would deliver answers and deepen an interesting take on the SW universe.  Instead it betrays us as soon as Luke tosses the lightsaber over his shoulder and ridicules the viewer with slapstick comedy\\, huge plot holes\\, a complete lack of scientific understanding (bombs dropping in space\\, arc lobbing shots on the Rebel cruiser)\\, and obvious marketing ploys Up until now I forgave Disney for only slightly touching the franchise....Rogue One was absolutely top-notch.  But The Last Jedi has their heavy-handed stamp all over it.  It's the first Star Wars film since 1977 that I never need to see again.  Shameful.","true":true}
