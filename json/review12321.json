Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am sorry but this movie has nothing to do with what made StarWars what it once was; I don't mean by that the original characters\\, I mean the vibe.\\n\\nSure\\, I understand wanting to appeal to a new generation of fans\\, however the entire thing is non sensical at best. No character depth once so ever\\, no rime or reason behind how it all shapes up\\, and at the end of the day I was left feeling that a bunch of 9 year olds were handed the job of coming up with a script and what they did was promote their kinder garden friends as the heroes of the movie (that is pretty much what the new bad boy and the new good girl seem like following the actions\/acting\/character arcs).\\n\\nOn a related note\\, greats to Disney for being so god damn politically correct and proving once again that nothing beats a good money grab. I would not recommend this movie to anyone going to the cinema\\, better wait for the BlueRay or just plain go get it online if you can","true":true}
