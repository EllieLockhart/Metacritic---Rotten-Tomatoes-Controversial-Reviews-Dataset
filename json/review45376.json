Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Vacuous film. So very disappointing. I had hope after The Force Awakens and dare i say excited after Rogue One\\, but nay\\, Disney went full Disney. Story? Meh\\, why bother. Its apparent they just dont care\\, if you are a fan of Star Wars save your money and more importantly dont encourage this shameful excuse of a cash grab. You aren\u2019t missing anything.","true":true}
