Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I'm not 100% sure what movie everyone else saw\\, but this was terrible! And I love Star Wars! And I liked Godzilla with Matthew Broderick\\, so you know I'm not picky! They totally phoned in the story\\, characters & script & made it all about the action. And don't get me wrong. The Force Awakens was great\\, so I thought this one would be stellar\\, but it was disjointed\\, clunky & an after thought. The acting was superb\\, but I can't go above 1 Star because the franchise deserves better.","true":true}
