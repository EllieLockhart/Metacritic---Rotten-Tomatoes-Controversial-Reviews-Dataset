Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is beautiful to look at and listen to\\, the cinematics and sound are amazing. However\\, the plot is horrible\\, the characters are uninteresting and\/or annoying\\, and the whole thing is infused with SJW nonsense.\\n\\nRey is a Mary Sue\\, Kylo Ren comes across as whiny and not even a little intimidating\\, and much of the rest of the characters seem to have been included to check boxes rather than tell an interesting or exciting story. Worst of all\\, Luke Skywalker acts in a way that runs completely contrary to his character in the original trilogy\\, and the change is a horrible one.\\n\\nThere are numerous internal consistencies and contradictions\\, and physics errors that are not even excusable in fantasy and sci-fi. A ship requires no fuel to move forward in space\\, only to accelerate (change speed or direction) to make course adjustments.\\n\\nI don't know if it is possible\\, but hopefully they replace both Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson and replace them with people who care about the Star Wars story and universe and are able to somehow make up for this horrible movie with the sequel.","true":true}
