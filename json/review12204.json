Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am completely dumbfounded that with all the attention they paid to recreate the look and feel of the star wars universe the creators allowed so many inaccuracies within the characters themselves. Most importantly we are to believe Luke the eternal optimist who would single handedly take on the entire Empire completely quits because his teenage nephew has conflicting thoughts.  This is the same Luke that refused to fight the badest sith in the galaxy and was able to turn him back to the light because he sensed the good within him. Now he is ghoing to kill his nephew because he can sense some darkness? Without a doubt the direction they took Luke is what I find most disappointing. The film is filled with ridiculous political and social undertones\\, plot holes and just down right poor story telling.","true":true}
