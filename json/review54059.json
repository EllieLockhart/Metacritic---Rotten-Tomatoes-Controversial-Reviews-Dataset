{"101487":130373,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-19","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I decided to add my review to this movie because I saw too many five star reviews that say something to the effect of \u201cdon\u2019t believe the fanboys and diversity haters\u201d... I am not a fanboy at all\\, I\u2019ve seen all the Star Wars movies because I am a movie buff but I\u2019ve never been a big fan\\, and I\u2019ve always thought that even the best Star Wars movies were just pretty good. Still\\, I appreciate what the franchise\u2019s mythology means in our pop culture and I\u2019ve always respected how the films do maintain a nice balance between fantastical science fiction and relatable characters and storylines. The biggest problem with this film -in my opinion- is simply how ridiculously unbelievable the narrative is\\, it\u2019s full of nonsensical plot holes and overall it just feels like \u2018who cares about any of this\u2019. Maybe a new generation of viewers will care about it\\, but me personally\\, you can\u2019t insult my intelligence and expect me to hang in there for future installments. For Disney\u2019s sake\\, I hope there\u2019s enough of these young kids and older audience members worldwide who like the mindless direction they\u2019re taking this franchise. I won\u2019t be watching anymore of them\\, this movie was that bad. Maybe in the future if there\u2019s a whole new storyline with completely new and unrelated characters\\, I might check out a movie when it comes to Netflix just out of curiosity about what they\u2019re doing with it...The Last Jedi was exhaustingly awful\\, like the worst of the previous installments (Phantom Menace would be my choice for second worst) but on top of being bad it was also completely full of holes and wtf bs moments and more yawn-inducing dead-behind-the-eyes pointlessness. I was hopeful because I like Rian Johnson\u2019s other films\\, but however it happened\\, this movie came out a giant turkey that left me with the feeling that the soul of the original Star Wars has been officially and irreversibly snuffed out. The End.","true":true}
