Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is bad.  \\n\\nNearly every characterization is botched.  You have jokes that are tonally awful for Star Wars.  Iron Man Leia is awful.  The CGI horse things are awful.  The entire quest of Poe\\, Finn\\, and Love Interest is unnecessary as nothing they do has any bearing on the plot (and arguably it gets a lot of people killed).  Luke Skywalker was going to murder a sleeping teen student?  Are you serious?  You just toss that in there?  His own sister's kid?  The entire characterization of Luke Skywalker is just awful\\, plus a really anticlimactic send-off.  \\n\\nSomeone needed to bring the director's vision in line with what's already established in the Star Wars universe.  Snokes?  Phasma?  Rey's parentage (And why she is go good at EVERYTHING)?  Guess none of it mattered at all.  Or at least\\, it didn't to Rian Johnson.  \\n\\nBut at least we had a great appearance by Yoda.  Who then Force Lightning-ed a tree.  That might have been handy in some of the prior movies.","true":true}
