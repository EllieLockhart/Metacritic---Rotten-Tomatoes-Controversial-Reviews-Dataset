Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is the great FILM... But it is not the great STAR WARS FILM\\, because some elements in this one are strange. Watching the film in  the cinema\\, I thought: \\\"This is like Marvel\\, not like Star Wars\\\".\\nFinally\\, in my opinion \\\"The Last Jedi' is good\\, but could be better. \\n\\n56% - it's too less\\n93% - it's too much","true":true}
