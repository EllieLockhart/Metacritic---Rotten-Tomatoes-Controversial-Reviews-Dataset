Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If Star Wars episode 7 was a good predictable retread of the same Star Wars formula we know and love then 8 is the opposite. It toys with our expectations and goes to new places and ideas not done before in a Star Wars movie. There were many great character developments that made the characters we love and the characters we hate much more complex and interesting. It still has the Star Wars whimsy and humor even in a story that was constantly threatening. It flips many expectations upside down and provided an incredible new story for old characters and new.","true":true}
