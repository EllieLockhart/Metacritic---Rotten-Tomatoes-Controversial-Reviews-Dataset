Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, if Rian Johnson wanted to do a favor to the feminist movement\\, he failed spectacularly\\, as the women in this movie\\, despite their good intentions\\, did not anything good. Admiral Holdo\\, the one who invented hyperspace ramming and therefore knew that it was a possibility from the very beginning\\, waits until only just one rebel ship remains (casually\\, the one with Leia\\, her secret lover) to perform her maneuver. More power to women. We all want to die due to their inability\\, ineptitude or hidden romances. \\nAnd giving Rey the proverbial Pussy-Pass so that everything is granted to her without the minimum effort is BY NO MEANS a favor to the feminist movement. JJ Abrams already made her a better pilot\/mechanic for the Millennium Falcon than Han Solo and the ability to beat a jedi master in a lightsaber duel WITHOUT ANY TRAINING. Remember that she was a scavenger living in a sandy planet. But Rian Johnson made her swim like a pro in The Last Jedi...\\nOne point for the feminists! Hooray!\\n\\nIf Rian Johnson wanted to do a favor to the diversity movement\\, he failed even more spectacularly. I think that the color of the skin of the characters in a Star Wars movie is not important at all. Give us good characters with plenty of back-story so that we can emotionally relate to them. Who cares whether they are white\\, black\\, yellow\\, red or even green or blue. And what about this VERY RACIST IDEA that people NEED characters of the same skin color to feel connected with them? I love Finn and I am not black. I don't love Rose not because she is Asian but because her character is badly written\\, unnecessary and\\, moreover\\, because she acts in a very stupid way\\, like stopping Finn from sacrificing himself for the resistance. By no way she could know that Luke would come and give the resistance more time to flee. So what she did is CONDEMNING THE RESISTANCE TO ANNIHILATION. Well done!\\nOne point for the diversity! Hooray!\\n\\nSo\\, to recap\\, dear Disney\\, if you want to give us a female hero\\, OK. If you want to give us colored heroes\\, OK. But they have to feel REAL and not like cardboard placeholder for the gender\/minority they represent.","true":true}
