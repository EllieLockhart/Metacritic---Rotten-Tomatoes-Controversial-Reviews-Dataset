Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You\u2019re disappointed and I get that. All your theories of the mythos have became a fanstisfal myth themselves. What you\u2019re left with instead is a tale vastly different than what you imagined and well thank God. I am glad we aren\u2019t retreading the same territory as we had in 7. This film is ingenious\\, it is original and masterly crafted. We have a broken hero\\, one who is overwhelmed with guilt and wonders if there is simply any purpose to the religion he holds so dear. The time of the jedi is to end\\, the sacred texts should be no more and the myth of Skywalker the one Rey knows\\, is embellished and simply not true. Is there a purpose to myth? to a religion? Faith that fails\\, faith that nobody listens to\\, faith that causes some to become hardened\\, evil as in the case of Kylo Ren. The purpose of Skywalker is not that he could take on the first order and bring balance to the force. Instead it is about what he represents. He is an idea\\, an ideology a mythic hero of abnormal proportions and abilities. He inspires us and in the end inspires the hopeless resistance. It is a beautiful film with themes unlike we have seen in any Star Wars movie. I loved it. ","true":true}
