Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Complete Review: 3\/4 Stars.\\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi is a story continuing off of the previous\\, The Force Awakens installment. The movie consists of beautiful spectacles\\, great action\\, and\\, as to be expected\\, a great musical score. The story is the weakest point of the film\\, but by there is definitely things to take out of it. The story mainly focuses around Rey and Luke Skywalker's interactions\\, as well as Rey and the antagonistic Kylo Ren. In this installment\\, Rey is given more of a character\\, but unfortunately isn't completely redeemed. She has very good scenes and interactions\\, as well as ideology and thought provoking questions risen about herself. Kylo Ren also sees light as he also questions himself. Beyond the two main leads\\, the original cast returns once again and the acting feels very emotional and driven. The writing is this movie's biggest downfall. There were plenty of scenes that were either unneeded\\, or simply went for two long. There were characters that fans were disappointed didn't get more screen time or attention\\, and simply felt like they were cast aside. The comedy in these movies are much better than that of the prequels. I often found myself laughing at many of the jokes in the film. They always seemed easygoing\\, and never went on for too long than they needed to\\, much to the extent of the previous installment. \\n\\nThe biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it fails to deliver what the majority wants. Most of the fans of Star Wars set their expectations far too high for the films of the series. You'll often find that people that haven't seen the previous movies\\, or aren't as into the Star Wars lore and universe will enjoy this movie much more rather than those who take the time to read the books\\, watch the television series\\, read and create wikis\\, and much to that extent. This movie is not for everyone\\, and that can be said for every single film ever created. Does this movie deserve a one star rating because of it's writing? Absolutely not. Does the writing drag the movie down? Yes. \\n\\nI always like to ask myself this question when I finish watching a movie. Was I satisfied\\, uninterested\\, or entertained? This question asks a lot\\, and makes you reconsider a movie after you watch it.  Satisfaction is the process of feeling that you got what you came for\\, and nothing more or nothing less. You recieved exactly what you expected\\, and you can say that a movie was good. Being uninterested would mean that the movie simply did not keep you interested and was not a good film in general. Being entertained is when a film does what it is supposed to do in its base. Entertain you for 2-3 hours. You may not get what you want\\, but did you sit there and find yourself taken to a new world or different story? Did you feel immersed and interested in what happened next? \\n\\nAfter asking myself this question\\, I came to agree that this movie entertained me. I felt thrill in the climax\\, I found myself worried in fight scenes\\, and I found myself taken to another world while I watched this movie. I dont think there was a single scene that I wanted to just gloss over and ignore\\, even if they were pointless. \\n\\nThat is the problem with most reviews about Star Wars. Fans expect to be Entertained AND Satisfied\\, and unfortunately\\, most of the time that doesn't happen. The original Star Wars films entertained us. They gave us characters and story that we loved. We had no bar set\\, and we didn't expect anything up and beyond. Now what happened when the prequels came out? Bars were set far too high\\, and people expected to be Satisfied by getting the same entertainment from the originals. When that didn't happen\\, the film was bashed. Now comes these new films. People set the bar (even higher) for satisfaction\\, and the film doesn't deliver. The Star Wars community is broken right now because they want to be Satisfied\\, not entertained. And no one should go into a movie expecting it to be satisfying. You should go into a movie with an open mind\\, and an expectation to be entertained. (It is called the Entertainment industry\\, not the Satisfaction industry.) \\n\\nWith that\\, I give Star Wars: The Last Jedi Four Stars out of Five.","true":true}
