Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to like this movie but can\u2019t. The entire Fin storyline was filler and a ware of time. Luke never leaving the island was a massive letdown. Not explaining who Snoke was before killing him off seems like lazy writing. No true game changers here like Empire. Mark Hamill deserves better. ","true":true}
