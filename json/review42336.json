Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie took chances and gave us a great chapter with the newer characters. I believe the Skywalker  decisions will pay off over time. Great pacing\\, but much to be desired from Finn and Rose","true":true}
