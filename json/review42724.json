Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was great. For some reason it hit some people the wrong way and I just don't get it. It's full of action\\, good characters\\, interestingly tied up loose ends. I can't wait for it to be out so I can buy it and watch again.\\n\\nSPOILERS:\\n\\nI mean\\, it had issues. A lot has been made about the way Snoke was defeated. And how Snoke was this big bad guy that came out of nowhere. Well\\, newsflash fanbois\\, Emperor Palpatine came out of nowhere too. There was no explanation whatsoever\\, you had to just accept that he HAD a back story that you don't know yet. \\nI will say\\, part of Fin's story in this movie didn't impact the overall plot. That's unfortunate and I wish they had tied that in better. But it was meaningful for that character.","true":true}
