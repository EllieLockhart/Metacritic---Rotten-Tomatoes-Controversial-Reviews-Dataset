Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What have I just watched? Because it wasn't Star Wars!\\nAde Edmondson on the bridge? Really?\\n\\nThis is a movie filled with unfunny comedy moments that didn't make the audience laugh once!\\nSo much potential was lost - Rey's parents and Snoke's backstory. The plot was very basic but far too drawn out\\, you could have cut it by 30 mins easily.\\n\\nLeia flying through the air is now officially worse than Jar Jar Binks! Well done\\, that must have taken some doing!! She's force sensitive\\, not a Jedi\\, not magic and not Superman!\\n\\nI really wanted to care and feel sadness when I thought she had been killed\\, but there was nothing. No heartstrings were pulled.\\n\\nThe casino was the \\\"obligatory\\\" cantina scene full of extras from Babylon 5. \\nPorgs... A great merchandising opportunity.\\n\\nStop killing characters we care about! Admiral Akbar was snuffed out just like that and then Luke too.\\nWe really care about these characters.\\n\\nWeak unfleshed out new characters\\, that you don't care about. And Phasma? In 2 films and still no point to her!\\n\\nI think you'll love this if you're not a Star Wars fan. It's cinematic & exciting. Kathleen Kennedy has made sure its packed to the rafters with women heroes\\, maybe overcompensating too much in the other direction now>\\n\\nRogue One was what a Star Wars movie should be\\, not this. Shame on you Disney :-(","true":true}
