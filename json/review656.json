I hate the Telltale games\\, and I didn't much care for Heavy Rain.  It certainly isn't worth $60\\, maybe $20\\, and it doesn't even have much replay value as there are very few differences besides the few different endings and some scenes where dead characters will be missing.\rStill\\, it was enjoyable and after the first fairly dull 3 hours I found it hard to put down.  It literally kept me up until dawn\\, and then some.\rI killed off a few characters the first time and immediately though\\, \\\"I shouldn't have done that.  That was stupider than a teen in a typical horror movie.\\\"  But other times all I did was miss a quick-time event sprung on me after a 10-minute non-interactive scene.\rThe plot is a bit predictable\\, but slightly twisty and fun.  The characters are typical shallow horror movie types\\, but I tended to care more about them as time went on.  I was rooting for them to die at first\\, but trying to save them by the end.\rI just don't understand why the couldn't have built in a few real game mechanics.  Why not let me run and climb like in Tomb Raider instead of pushing a triangle at the correct moment to jump to a higher ledger or slide under a tree?  I don't get that.\rStill\\, it is something different and quite entertaining.  Although there are passages where the characters look like the \\\"zombie\\\" children from The Polar Express\\, the acting and animation is usually quite good and many emotions are conveyed.\rIt is far from perfect\\, but it is a milestone in the interactive movie genre.\rIt is at least worth a rental if you have a PS4.  Or buy it and lend it to friends when you are done.  One or two times through is enough unless you really want to get all the collectibles\\, and have to sit through hours and hours of the same non-skipable scenes again and again.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
