Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a great movie one of the best star wars episodes ever a little bit long yes but I was never bored I was with 8 people of many ages and everyone loved it.To all the people who are dissing this movie you think you are true fans of star wars but all you want is more of the same old stuff and never change they are keeping the story fresh while paying homage to the past.now some of you  not all a small precent hate a woman who is powerful and some of you hate that the black man is a good guy and they didn't kill him off or both so get over it and enjoy the movies or go back and hide in your room on your computer looking at your red pill websites.","true":true}
