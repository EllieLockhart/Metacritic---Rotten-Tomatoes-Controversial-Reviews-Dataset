Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At a loss of words to how amazing this film was. Everyone is subject to their opinion and mine isn't to insult another about his\/hers. What stands out about this Star Wars as opposed to all others is its uniqueness for change and creativity\\, while it grabs small bits and pieces from past films\\, it wasn't like TFA\\, which I loved\\, where it was a remaster of A New Hope. From the inner conflict each of the main characters face\\, to the complex situations they have to face is something new to the saga\\, and it's all for the better. While their definitely was some things that they could've done a little bit better. But nothing\\, in my opinion\\, can disregard that this was an amazing movie\\, with great direction.","true":true}
