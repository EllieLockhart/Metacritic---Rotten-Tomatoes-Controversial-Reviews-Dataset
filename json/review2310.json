Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Atrocious Pile of utter garbage.\\n\\nWhen I asked for a Force Awakens sequel I didn't want a film where there are billions of plotholes\\, pointless and annoying characters (Rose\\, Phasma\\, Hux\\, That woman with the purple wig\\, whatever the fuck her name was) and complete disregard for beloved characters. What the hell where you thinking Rian Johnson?! You completely ruined everything that made Star Wars great once by giving us a enormous pile of shit called The Last Jedi where absolutely nothing eventful happens and where you carelessly disrespect everything JJ Abrahams gave us hope to look forward too (Rey's parents\\, the identity of General Snoke\\, Rey finally getting to interact with and learn from Luke Skywalker and Finn actually doing something useful) . The only thing that was memorable was maybe the special effects\\, but I mean\\, that's nothing new for the Star Wars franschise. Absolute Garbage\\, DON'T watse your time nor money on this flick.","true":true}
