Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney dropped the ball on this one. For the second movie in a row kylo ren character is the most dense and weakest part of the new trilogy. Movie is highly predictable and there is no emotional connection with the audience cause the story is not giving us any back story to make the audience have any type of connections. Yet they keep trying to force it upon us.","true":true}
