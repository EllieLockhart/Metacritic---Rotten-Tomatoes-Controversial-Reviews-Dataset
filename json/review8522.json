Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"First and foremost\\, this is not a good film. On top of that\\, this is not a good Star Wars film. The movie is filled with plot lines that make no sense and\/or go nowhere\\, characters with inexplicable behavior\\, and slapstick the likes of which we all hated in the prequels. \\n\\nOn top of that\\, the movie does not do justice to existing Star Wars characters or lore\\, and that goes both for old and new.","true":true}
