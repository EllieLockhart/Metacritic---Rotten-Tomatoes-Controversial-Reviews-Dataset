Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney decided to take a shit on another movie by forcing laughter through an animal sidekick... and it didn\u2019t work unless you are under the age of 12. The last 1\/3 of the movie is pretty good but it makes the first 2\/3 of the movie pretty much worthless. Watching Leia use the force and \u201cSuperman\u201d it back to the transport ship was excruciatingly painful. Lastly\\, the beginning of the movie is incredibly slow (after the first 5 minutes). To the point where it teeters on boring. This movie had so much potential and in my opinion it fell flat. ","true":true}
