Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My excitement to see this movie was a solid geek 10.  My disappointment after seeing it is now equally high. Didn't\\, Rian\\, why?\\nLuke Skywalker is a cinematic piece of gold. Royalty. And you made him spend half the film whining\\, half the film being scared\\, half the film crabbing\\, then set him up for a great duel\\, but instead made him a hologram quickly fading into force dust. Why?  Why not do something cool?  My 5 year old could have given you a better Luke Plot. Throwing away the lightsaber?  Why?  So dumb.  We spend a whole movie waiting for that moment and then you irreverently crap all over it. It's OK to celebrate the lore and mystique. DO NOT KILL THE PAST. Maybe Rian got a little too caught up in Kylo?    \\n\\nThis film should be called \\\"The Wasted Potential.\\\"  Kathleen Kennedy should be removed as the \\\"caretaker.\\\"  Bring back the mystique and mythos. This is a Space Opera\\, not Spaceballs. It was depressing to watch Luke play a parody of himself. The FA set up so manny potentially great payoffs and none came through.  I have never been more disappointed seeing a film.","true":true}
