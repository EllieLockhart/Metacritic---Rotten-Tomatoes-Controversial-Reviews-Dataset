Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So dissatisfied by this movie. A complete disregard for the fans and the investment of time and care for the characters in TFA. Once again\\, just like Lost\\, JJ Abrams sets up something exciting only to go absolutely nowhere and give no pay-off for two years of anticipation. I\u2019ve lost interest and care.","true":true}
