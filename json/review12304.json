Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am sick and tired of Star Wars become nothing more than a Walking Dead \\\"Who is going to die\\\" shell game. I didn't wait 30 years to see the original characters that I loved as a kid come back only to sit through a 2 hour movie just to watch them die. As far as movie goes the story made little sense\\, it dragged in many places\\, and didn't answer any questions and in fact only left us asking more. I have no idea what movie people who have rated this thing much higher watched. There were parts that were cool\\, a couple of surprises\\, but all in all it lacked anything that I hope for and left me pissed off and bitter. Bitter that Disney took my childhood and is slowly killing it off.","true":true}
