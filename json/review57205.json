Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This move was awful the first time I saw it. The mess of a plot\\, the lack of charachter development\\, Leah Poppins\\, what they did with the character of Luke Skywalker\\, the pointless subplots\\,  I could go on and on.  By any measure this is fundamentally a bad movie.  I honestly tried to watch it again during an international flight but could not get past the holding for Hux scene.","true":true}
