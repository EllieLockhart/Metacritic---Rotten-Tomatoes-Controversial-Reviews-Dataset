Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Without spoiling anything... Great movie\\, many plot twists and so much more. Mark Hamill did a fantastic job as did the new cast. I am happy to disagree with others\\, have loved Star Wars since seeing the original in its original run and liked The Last Jedi. It has taken me a couple days to fully process the end\\, really shocked me and left me quite sad. My expectations were fairly high and they were exceeded. Luke said it \u201cThis will not go the way you expect it to...\u201d and was right on so many levels.","true":true}
