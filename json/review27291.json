Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Only idiots doing bots would use presidential names to create 5 star reviews cause your too lazy to use creative names to do your botting..  get over it Lucas Films.. this movie was some of the worst writing i have seen in a movie in a LONG LONG time..  a total waste of some amazing actors and actresses.. do them some justice.. stop with your political bs and write good scripts for them to act and for us to enjoy.  Thank you","true":true}
