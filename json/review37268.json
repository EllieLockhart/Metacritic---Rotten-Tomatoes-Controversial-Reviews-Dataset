Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The performances\\, visual effects and soundtrack were really good but unfortunately the story and the coherence of the story ruins episode VII and the original trilogy.\\n\\nIn spite of years on training and meditation Luke appears to be a Jedi who is not able to control his feeling because he is scare for the strong power in the force that Rey has and he tries to kill Ben Solo to prevent him from fulfilling his future of becoming Darth Vader but in the Return of the Jedi he is able to control his feelings not killing his father. \u00a1He supposed to be a combination between Joda and Mace Windu for that time!\\n\\nThe Director do not understand the essence of what does Star Wars means.\\nHe said that he has created something new and original but there are many things that he has taken from Looper. Not because that movie and its ideas were a success means that those now are going to be again a success in a different kind of movie.","true":true}
