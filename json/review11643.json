Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Horribly movie\\, horrible plot\\, with many plot holes Immature storyline with lack of character development. Hated the new unnecessary Main characters\\, holDo\\, and rose.  above all They distroyed reys Character. She got powers out of no where with no hard work biggest Merry sue in any Movie ive ever seen. Movie is honestly\\nCoMplete trash. Literally just a TYPICALLY al marvel hero movie.  Boring predictable anD aBove all childish. Ryan Johnson should be ahsamed HIs arAgance caused him to discard eveything jj creatEd","true":true}
