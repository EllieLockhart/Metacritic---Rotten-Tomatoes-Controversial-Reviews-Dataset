Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a bot\\, but I wonder about the reviewers who are leaving 5 stars.  Most reviewers of this movie that are critical are giving a litany of reasons why.  They go into detail about what they found wrong with this movie.  So much so that I won't I will just say that I was profoundly disappointed.\\n\\nHowever\\, most people that are giving it 5 stars are often not giving as in-depth reasons why they liked this movie.  So\\, why are the negative reviewers being accused of being bots (or worse)?\\n\\nI'd really like to know...what did people who are giving it such high marks like about this movie?  \\n\\nIs it...\\nThe dumb jokes?\\nThe lack of continuity?\\nLuke acting like a sullen brat?\\nFlying Leia?\\nThe annoying Rose?\\nThe boring casino part?\\nYoda acting like a lunatic?\\n\\nI could go on\\, but I really didn't want to list my complaints.  I just wanted to know what people actually liked about this movie.....PEOPLE THAT WEREN\\\"T PAID OFF BY DISNEY that is.","true":true}
