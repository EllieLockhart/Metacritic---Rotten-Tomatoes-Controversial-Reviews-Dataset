Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How can Ray be stronger than Luke without any jedi training?\\nHow can Ray lift a mountain without any jedi training?\\nHow can Ray be stronger than the emperor guards without jedi training?\\n\\nThis is not how star wars works.\\n\\nAlso\\, why bother finding the dead star plans and weakneses if you can easily destroy it by hyperspacing a big junk ship into it?","true":true}
