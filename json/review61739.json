I enjoy reading them but never felt conflicted enough to spend the time I have to actually leave one. Until now. I read so much hate on this game. Hours of reviews\\, of videos\\, even of conversations with friends. But all of it is complete malarkey. This is a beautifully designed and written game. I am blown away at the pettiness people have towards such minuscule things that actually make the game so great! I understand that people have developed feelings towards certain characters based off the first(also amazing) game. And what happened in this game definitely shook me to my core. But when has a game done that for you?! When did a game challenge you and your complete way of thinking towards a situation? We are so focused on our own issues\\, our own thoughts that we can\u2019t even see what is going on from another point of view. But this game does that. This game is firing on so many levels and showing people there is a story to both sides and literally puts you in their shoes. Also being completely diverse with its characters is just incredible. Even in an apocalyptic world people are going to be who they are. And raging mushroom headed monsters or scars or rattlers or anyone for that matter is going to change that. I wanted to write a review because I believe this game is so much more than just a game. I wanted to give it the justice it deserved. I am sorry that people are having issues with characters or story line or whatever it is but I just think their perception is slightly blinded by the hurt they may have felt. I did have some pretty high expectations but this game blew right past them. I am so sad it is over but so glad I got to go through it. So anyways\\, I hope whoever is reading this\\, whether they have or have not played the game\\, just keep an opened mind. We all got to be apart of an amazing journey and that is that part we cannot forget. Thank you for you time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
