Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While the movie has its flaws\\, it is definitely a worthy addition to the saga. And I wonder how much of those flaws are the face that I'm seeing the movies from a nearly 40-year old perspective\\, versus that of a 7-year old. \\n\\nSome of the parallels were obviously forced\\, however\\, I did love the subversion and thus lampshading of some specific Star Wars tropes.","true":true}
