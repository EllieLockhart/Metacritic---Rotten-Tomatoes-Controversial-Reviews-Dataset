Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"very poor. flat story without any real development. squandered every character's potential and left me wondering what the point of the film was by the time it was all said and done. I really don't understand why critics are going crazy over this film.","true":true}
