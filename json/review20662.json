Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I\u2019ve seen this movie multiple times in theaters. Im a Star Wars fan and i had very high expectations. This movie works as a big band aid for the stuff that didn\u2019t work in The Force Awakens\\, but it goes too far. For example i wanted more poe and less Finn. They did that. I wanted more Luke. They did that. But in the end much of the travels of all the characters end up not mattering\\, and the ending is entirely independent of most of the film. It went too far to swerve the audience. Too many things went strayed too far from cannon. This was an anti-fan film that was a very well made middle finger to cannon. I enjoyed that part but it went too far and forgot to tell a story id want to watch. Ill hate watch it again but its better than the prequels. Ill watch the next film bc i have to. ","true":true}
