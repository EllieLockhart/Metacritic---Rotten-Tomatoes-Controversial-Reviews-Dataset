Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hated how luke skywalker was treated with the cop out ending. And making luke even thinking about killing his nephew is so out of character. Luke wouldn't even kill vader (whom he only briefly knew was his father) who has committed atrocities for years.\\n\\nThere's no need to build new characters (eg rey) by tearing down old ones (eg luke). This will definitely turn away old loyal fans of star wars. Very very sad\\, i will miss star wars.","true":true}
