Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Some hardcore fans will be salty about it \\\"not following the books\\\" or other details in the film.  But it's the best movie of the year!  and the best Star Wars movie since Empire!","true":true}
