Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"\\\"Breathe....just...b r e a t h e.\\\" These were the words that I kept telling myself during the entire movie. Quite possibly the worst Star Wars movie in the franchise. It felt as if 7 or 8 different directors were each responsible for their own section of the film. Then\\, two weeks before the release date\\, they all came back together in one room and duct taped each director's parts together to make one movie. It was obvious from the start that there are many hands in the pot; they had to satisfy many different (corporate) people\\, in order to get final approval for this film. The marketing department\\, the feminists\\, the purists\\, the kids\\, the parents\\, the shareholders\\, and somewhere in there\\, they hoped the true Star Wars fans as well....they were wrong. I was really really disappointed with this movie. It wasn't total trash\\, but it was close. Nipple Milk \/ Milk Mustache\\, Leia Superman Scene\\, Rose\/Finn Scene\\, Chewy Chicken Scene\\, SUPER Cheesy humor\\, etc etc. I could go on and on and on. I wish I could unsee this movie. CGI was okay in space\\, but certain scenes were actually subpar\\, almost early 2000's level technology. This movie makes The Force Awakens look SO much better.","true":true}
