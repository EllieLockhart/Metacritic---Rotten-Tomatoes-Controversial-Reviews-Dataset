Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Pretty enjoyable if you don't expect too much\\, which means don't take the most glowing reviews too seriously. Lots of rehashed plot ideas here\\, just like with Force Awakens\\, but also enough funny\/thrilling\/surprising moments for me to say I enjoyed it. ","true":true}
