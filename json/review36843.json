Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"the movie was absolutely incredible. i grew up with the star wars movies. this movie is easily the best star wars movie to date. people will complain if the movie is too different but also complain if it's too similar. don't let people's loud negative opinions keep you from seeing this incredible movie. it is one of my favorite movies ever. everyone i've spoken to agrees. the negative opinions just happen to be louder. trust me\\, most people thought it was incredible.","true":true}
