Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When I watched this movie on the big screen\\, I was wanting more of Luke Skywalker\\, which the last movie was lacking of. While Luke has a lot of screentime in this movie\\, his writing betrays his original character. (Spoilers) Instead of being optimistic and wise\\, like in ROTJ\\, he just becomes a washed up hermit who gives up\\, even on life in the end. Also\\, the main characters are not interesting or written poorly. Finn\\, which was my favorite of The Force Awakens is now just a laughing stock and wasted character. Poe\\, which I also liked\\, now doesn't contribute anything and doesn't get any character development in this movie. Rey\\, from the start and now is just a dull and boring character.","true":true}
