Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Things that make me love Star Wars\\,\\n\\n- The sense of meaningful adventure\\n- The excellent pacing\\n- The large scale of conflicting battle between good and evil \\n- The believable and likable characters\\, as well as the journey the protagonist and antagonist go through\\n- The amazing places and environments\\, the lore\\n- The right amount of wit and humor \\n- Epic lightsaber duels\\n\\nThe Last Jedi has none of this or fails at executing it.","true":true}
