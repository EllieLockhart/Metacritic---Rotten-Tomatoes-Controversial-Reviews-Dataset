Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"missed story telling opportunities. who is snoke? who are Rey parents? kylo ren as a big villian?..please nobody is afraid of that cry baby or will ever fear that character. Skywalker and Solo ARE Star Wars...you can't do star wars without a Skywalker or Solo...get control of your visions to burn everything down and start again...i thought this was supposed to be a continuation of first trilogy. here is the plot of this trilogy: kill off all the characters that had any story background to them. watchout chewie...your next on the kill list.Refund please!!!
