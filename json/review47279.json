Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a stinker of a movie... I am so depressed everything good from Star Wars was casually thrown out to make way for such a jumbled collection of poorly written characters and absurd running around to find nothing. The action scenes were terrible - the throne room fights was the poorest chirography ever and WTF with those red salts racers? The biggest problem was how it threw away any consistency with the story built up in the previous 7 movies and left the next one hanging in the \\\"make it up as you go\\\" wilderness.","true":true}
