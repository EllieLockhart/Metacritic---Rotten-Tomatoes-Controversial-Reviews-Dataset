Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've been a Star Wars fan all my life\\, it's in my family's DNA... And for the first time I'm certain that I don't care if another film comes out\\, and I'm fairly sure I will not be seeing the next one\\, or the Han Solo film\\, or the Obi-Wan Kenobi film\\, or Ryan Johnson's trilogy. I'm simply done. \\n\\nI am not a Russian hacker\\, a troll from 4 chan\\, or a clone account. I am simply a disgruntled customer\\, and rotten tomatoes being the zeitgeist of modern film critique it is\\, I have made my way here to make a complaint to customer service.\\n\\nDisney\\, this film is very poorly made\\, the inconsistencies are literally too many to mention... It shouldn't take a several year course in Star Wars apologetics in order to spackle over this magnitude of lazy writing.\\n\\nWhat I don't understand is how Ryan Johnson\\, a fairly gifted writer\\, as proven by his previous films\\, can turn out something this ridiculously bad... Unless of course it was a film by committee that is\\, and if so shame on you Kathleen Kennedy\\, shame on you Lucasfilm\\, and shame on you Disney. If not\\, shame on you Ryan Johnson\\n\\n With critics giving this a higher consensus then many legitimate Academy award-winning film treasures\\, there is definitely something rotten in Denmark. And with Disney overtaking more and more studios\\, this monopoly does not pertain well for the future of fair and trustworthy reviews.\\n\\nSo again\\, I'm done. And if enough of us are done you're going to feel it\\, not our words.. But where it seems to matter most to you\\, in your bank account.","true":true}
