Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I liked that there were risks taken with some characters and the movie aimed to change things up\\, but plot holes kill this one.  \\n\\nI'm also left wondering why I am not wondering what will happen in the next movie. Whatever held me as a casual fan in the first 7 movies is missing.\\n\\nNo additional viewings for me... once was more than enough.","true":true}
