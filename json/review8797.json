Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Forget all the \u201cfans\u201d who complained about this movie. I\u2019m a lifelong fan and LOVED it! I appreciated the subtle comedic moments\\, new characters\\, silly creatures\\, and one liners. Also\\, whoever did the casting needs to get an academy award for detail. Fantastic addition to the Star Wars saga! ","true":true}
