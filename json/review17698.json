Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It broke my heart watching this. After 40 years since I saw the first Star Wars film\\, the dream is finally over. I thought that JJ Abrams had rescued it from the jaws of defeat and I was wrong. Like many\\, Star Wars was a revalation to me as a young boy\\, and eventually inspired me to work in the movie Industry\\, which I was in for 10 years (I even got to work at Elstree Studios where the beloved Empire was shot!). The Last Jedi? The last Star Wars film. (And I say that loosley).  Alas now\\, the journey has come to an end. With a tear in my eye\\, I'm saying goodbye to the franchise. RIP Star Wars.","true":true}
