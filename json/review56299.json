Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star War: The Last Jedi is an excellent film. It is about Rey who develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker. Daisy Ridley\\, Mark Hamill\\, and Carrie Fisher give incredible performances. The script is well written. Rian Johnson did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and fantasy. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a must see.","true":true}
