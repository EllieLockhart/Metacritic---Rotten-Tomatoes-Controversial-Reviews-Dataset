Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie broke my heart.  Adults openly boo'ed in the theater.\\nLuke Skywalker\\, the greatest Jedi of all time is turned into a Monte Python version of himself.  Did we really need to see him milk a fcking alien.  For 30 years have waited for the day he picked up his light saber and battled for good.  Instead he dies like the tortuous from king fu panda.  Just drifts off into the mist. \\n\\nFor the last two year\\, tens of thousand have wounder the answer to the two great movie plot lines.  Who is snoke and who are Rey's parents.... doesn't matter anymore because snoke was killed like he had no power as Rey's parents are drunks\\n\\nPure garbage and I have no idea who the critics rate this movie as a masterpiece. I must have been in the wrong theather.","true":true}
