Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was so all over the place with the characters and story it was hard to stay focused on who was doing what. IF you came to this movie as a fan of previous movies dont bother. It adds nothing to fans besides a big middle finger to you. and with the trend growing where Disney bought movies would rather try and make you laugh rather than build characters or have an interesting or developed story.  this movie was so god awful and there were so many plot holes that left me scratching my head wondering \\\"Why?\\\". This was clearly a movie made by Disney to sell action figures and merchandise.","true":true}
