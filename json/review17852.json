Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It had some good moments but otherwise it was vacillating between being boring or stupid.  I'd say it was worse than almost all the prequels and odd numbered Star Trek movies.  It could have been so much more interesting with the same basic outline but it's like they didn't even care to put in the effort.  I really don't know what the critics that really liked it were thinking\\, especially those who said it was the best since Empire.  Were they afraid of being blacklisted by Disney or something if they weren't gushing?","true":true}
