Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I wanted to love this movie badly\\, but poor character develop\\, plot holes\\, and pointless side stories as filler makes me borderline hate this movie. I have loved Star Wars since I was a little kid and this movie was almost as bad as \u201cAttack of the Clones\u201d. Hopefully JJ Abrams will wrap the series nicely\\, but I\u2019m not holding my breath after this one.","true":true}
