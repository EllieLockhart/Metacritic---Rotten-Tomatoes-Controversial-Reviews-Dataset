Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Such a disappointment. They have totally ruined Starwars in my opinion. Uncle George should of never sold it. They should of let it go after RotJ.  Killed the bad guy before episode nine? No backstory on Snoke or Rey. I think kylo lied to her. I think she does have a place in the story. Lukes lightsaber wouldnt have called to her otherwise. They took an awesome story and murdered it. Long live the REAL starwars movies episodes 1 2 3 4 5 and my favorite 6.","true":true}
