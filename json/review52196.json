Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After watching the full series with my girlfriend\\, this movie stood out in a very negative way. If feels like they completely re-wrote Luke's personality. Further\\, The girl who saved Finn not only killed herself\\, but also killed literally the entire rebellion AND Finn (to her knowledge) in a weird and unnatural sacrifice. Also why would ice foxes exist on a salt planet? There are a lot more weird reasons this move was underwhelming (mostly character deaths and characters that should have died) but I'm not here to cover all of them.","true":true}
