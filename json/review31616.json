Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So much wasted time.  Terrible subplot that went no where.  Nothing happens at all\\, that you couldn't sum up in 2 minutes.  There's hardly any fighting or conflict.. and the main plot was weak.  Additionally\\, don't understand how\/why Leia is blown into space if not to kill her character off... just strange and odd.  The thing I hated the most\\, aside from the lack of direction\\, action\\, or even interesting story\\, was the stupid personified critters that stink of George Lucas.  He put those stupid things in his Indiana Jones remake and now they show up in a movie he's not even supposed to be directing.  The bird hamsters completely distract from the movie and just add a general feeling that the entire movie is geared toward children and not the adult base that grew up (and loved) the harsh reality of consequence.","true":true}
