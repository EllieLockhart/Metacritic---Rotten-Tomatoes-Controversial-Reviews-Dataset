Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"7\/10\\nThis film was so visually pleasing and enjoyable at parts\\, yet so disrespectful to the lore and kind of ruined some characters. It also threw everything The Force Awakens established out of the window and leaves the final instalment of the trilogy a complete mess. I did still enjoy myself though\\, just sad at the incredibly wasted potential.","true":true}
