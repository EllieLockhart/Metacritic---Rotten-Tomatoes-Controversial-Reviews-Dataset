Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is the most disapointing movie I've ever seen! This movie has rare moments where the best of pre-Disney shines through\\, but it is completely outweighed by all the idiotic moments through out the film\\, and times these moments rival the worst parts of the prequel movies in pure stupidity. Characters are dumb for the sake of being dumb\\, some characters do not match their orginal selves\\, parts of this movie can completely written out aa they are completely pointless\\, and there is almost no sense of tension. I wanted to love this movie so bad\\, but I just can't. Rian Johnson completely killed Star Wars for me.","true":true}
