Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Third best film of the franchise. They had to take the saga into a new direction. You can't do re-treads forever. You have to let go of the past. It has its problems (the side-quest)\\, but it challenged you as a viewer and set up for something new while maintaining the star wars feel.","true":true}
