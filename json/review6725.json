Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't let the disturbingly high number of viewers who didn't like it fool you: Rian Johnson's \\\"The Last Jedi\\\" is the best Star Wars film in the last 37 years\\, and maybe ever. The direction is superb\\, the writing is mostly well-done\\, and John Williams's orchestral score is as John Williams's orchestral score does. If it sometimes feels like too many characters and plot threads have been shoved into the film's substantial two and a half-hour runtime\\, it is a testament to the skill of the creators involved that this comes off more as a minor distraction or annoyance than a critical flaw in the movie itself. The film's plot is a solid refutation of the idea that Disney is afraid to take risks with its adopted franchise; it's just a pity that the very audiences who say they want these risks taken are giving this bold entry in the Star Wars saga so much crap.","true":true}
