Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing! Left theatres feeling empty\\, unsatisfied and not much excited for the next instalment. The plot lacks direction and the pace of the film is a mess. The humour feels out of place\/forced (no pun intended) and is basically silly at times to the detriment of the characters. It does have some surprises but unfortunately they're only their for the purpose of subverting expectations and these decisions overall hurt the larger narrative. In conclusion it's mostly a disappointment because of the potential unrealised here and the lack of either understanding or respect for the source material.","true":true}
