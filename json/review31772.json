Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So upset.  saw this in the 70's as a teenager.  The force awakens was meh.  This totally sucked.  I get the whole Luke is old and bitter. But all of the other characters were either not fleshed out or killed off.  What the hell.  Leia is Dead in real life you could go back and change the ending.  You do realize this is the Skywalker \\\"history\\\" so they are all dead before the last movie.  Rey and Kylo are the future\\, Killing Snoke the big baddy so early","true":true}
