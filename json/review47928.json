Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I loved the Force Awakens\\, there was a lot there that was a rehash of things past. Nothing wrong with that\\, I think it was needed at the time\\, but I'm pleased to see that they went a different route with this one. I can understand that those fans who see the OT as pure Star Wars and will not accept anything that deviates from that may not like it so much\\, however I personally found this refreshing\\, with enough nods to the past that you could feel like it really was a Star Wars movie\\, but with enough that was new and fresh that it feels like the beginning of a new era.  I can't wait to see what comes next.","true":true}
