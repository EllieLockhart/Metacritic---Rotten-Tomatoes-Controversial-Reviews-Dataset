Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*copy-pasted from another reviewer as I completely agree*\\nTerrible writing\\, zero character development\\, blatant merchandise pushing\\, and obvious political statements that make this movie seem like it's not in a galaxy far away. Are we suppose to believe that Luke\\, who turned himself into the empire because he believed the most evil man in the galaxy still had good in him\\, would attempt to murder his own nephew while he slept because he thought he might turn to the dark side? Also\\, how did he die? Using the force too hard? Wasn't Snoke using the same force power to project Kylo and Rey to each other? How about an entire horrible and irrevalent casino scene that wouldn't have needed to happen if Holdo just told everyone what she was thinking. How about her staring at the escape pods getting destroyed for like 10 mins before she lightspeeds into the First Order? That terrible dialogue at the beginning with the prank call? Legitimately funny the first viewing but stupid when you realize they dont take themselves seriously for the duration of the movie as well. How this movie got over 90% critic score is one of the most confusing things I've ever experienced.","true":true}
