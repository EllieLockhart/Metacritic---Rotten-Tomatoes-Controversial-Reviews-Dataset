Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love Star Wars and I came out of the film wanting to like this movie but in the end I have to admit the movie is bad.  You should not come out of a movie like this asking yourself \\\"did I just like that?\\\"  I have never felt this way about any other Star Wars movie or any of the recent Marvel movies.","true":true}
