Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie succeeds in moving the plot forward\\, developing the characters in an interesting fashion\\, and giving the audience an unexpected and original story that topples the tropes that made \\\"The Force Awakens\\\" simply a love letter to nostalgic fans. This is a quality film that answers the questions posed by the last installment (or merely renders them moot) and opens the door wide for the characters to go anywhere or do anything in the next episode. Some people would be happy to see the same movie redone over and over again\\, but people who enjoy seeing something new and creative will like \\\"The Last Jedi\\\"","true":true}
