Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While it can be enjoyable at times (mainly just seeing Luke back) it's undeniable that this film completely misses the mark on what a Star Wars film should be. The first scene of the film sums the rest of it up with Luke chucking the lightsaber over his head which could almost be seen as a metaphor for Rian Johnson scrapping the story that was set up in The Force Awakens. Overall\\, distasteful to say the least as a Star Wars fan and really fails at capturing anything worthwhile. However\\, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is always good :)","true":true}
