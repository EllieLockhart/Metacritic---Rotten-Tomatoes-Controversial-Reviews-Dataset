{"101487":170363,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-25","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars The Last Jedi was a blockbuster? No more like a Lackluster!\\nHere's my Likes.\\ncinematography\\nsound\\npo space fight scene\\nRey and Kylo fighting together\\nPorgs\\nkamemazi Hyper Speed\\n\\nDislikes\\nconsistency wasn't there\\ncontradictions throughout\\nall characters except for Mr. Del Toro were out of character\\nsubplot ending up being the main plot\\, and pointless one at that\\nthe pilot sister think her name is page isn't effected when opening the hangar to release the bombs by the vacuum of space\\ngravity in space dropping bombs??\\nForced love interest between Rose and Finn when Finn were showing signs his interest in Rey character already\\nLuke Skywalker wasn't Luke Skywalker regardless anyone argument that he can change in those years. No\\, nobody changes that much. Luke had Dark Side traits in ROTJ\\, but he still found good in the 2nd most evil character in the known SW Galaxy\\, and then wants to kill his own flesh and blood because a little dark side traits was shown in his nephew. Get out of here. \\nwasted a perfectly good villians (Snoke and Captain Phasma).\\ndeath of Luke\\, Rian Johnson said Luke was in the way of telling the story of the characters and just wanted to get rid of him in any way possible\\nRian Johnson\\, he killed the trilogy halfway through. Did he not think there was one more movie? Did he forgot and thought this was the end and final climactic ending? Terrible\\nforced comedy\\, it felt like SNL or Marvel Comedy when Star Wars comedy is sarcastic and witty and pointing out the obvious\\nit had no substances\\, empty\\, bad storytelling. It completely lost the essence of Star Wars\\nthere was no self sacrifice.\\nwas I watching Star Trek? But tried to hard to be Funny?\\nthe casino scene felt like I was watching a combination of Fifth Element and Men In Black.\\ncould have avoided mutiny if Po was told the plan.\\nit didn't savor any moment of sadness or emotions just to be interrupted by comedy.\\nno one came for help\\, literally the Resistance was down to 20 people. How the heck you're going to come back and win with those odds?\\nif Snoke ship can track in hyper speed why not send coordinates to trap them...\\ndeath of Ackbar\\, should have been him doing the suicide hyper drive\\nYoda using force lightening as a ghost... Couldn't he do that to Kylo Ren??\\nJedi Order ending... Or is it? Rey got the books.\\nRian Johnson middle finger to all what J.J. Abrams set up;\\nlightsaber found its way back to Luke\\, F*** you I'm tossing it.\\nresistance base\\, F*** you I'm blowing it up\\nRey's Parents\\, F*** you she isn't special. They sold her for drinks because... They're poor? Even though they flew away in a nice spaceship. Doesn't makes sense\\nCaptain Phasma? F*** you\\nSnoke? F*** you\\nDel Toro character. Let me take your necklace just to use it as a super conductor and return it because I'm nice oh wait I betrayed you.\\nKeeping Princess Leia alive knowing she has past away making the next Director have a very difficult time to deal with that. Kill her off offscreen? CGI Leia?\\nMary Poppins Leia\\nMary Sue Rey. Powered without training? \\nprequels don't look so bad. Force Awakens and Rogue One seems extremely good in comparison.\\ndidnt follow through any plot or plan.\\nwhy didn't Leia lift the rocks?\\nwhy didn't Abrams direct The Last Jedi?\\nHow did Rian Johnson get his own Trilogy?\\nF*** you to Star Wars\\nF*** you to fans\\nall about making money and merchandise... I bought myself a Porg.\\nRian Johnson's arrogance into thinking people bot to give bad reviews... Get your head out your ass. How could you disgrace Star Wars and it's characters this bad? N you won't own up to it.\\n\\nPS: Petition for a remake of The Last Jedi directed by anyone else preferably J.J. Abrams and to receive and utilize creative advice from George Lucas and Mark Hamill.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi was a great disappointment and didn't answer any questions but take the easy way out with the most LAZY storytelling in history.\\n\\nBut it is SLIGHTLY better than Dragon Ball Evolution\\, and Slightly better than the movie In The Name of The King only because of visuals and sounds. Storytelling wise\\, same level.","true":true}
