Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Awful. Awfully paced. Awfully acted. Awfully written. I think this might be the worse Star Wars movie ever made. \\n\\nThe trouble is everything the first movie promised is revealed to have been poorly planned (typical of JJ Abrams) and this movie falls flat on its face. You can literally see the by the numbers writing in it's attempt to make audiences react the way it wants with it's constant use of cute animals and putting them in danger so the audience will feel sympathy. \\n\\nAnd they need it because the humans are so devoid of emotion that you won't care about them one bit. Hell two characters just go missing for what feel like hours and all I could think is Where did those two disappear to? Only to have them pop up not in a big reveal but just in a random scene. \\n\\nThis is where the Star Wars magic died for people I'm afraid. Sadly it died for me at Rogue One.","true":true}
