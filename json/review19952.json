Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was frustrating to watch this series get hijacked by the radical feminists.  Having Luke get cucked and having the purple haired lady ruin the movie has basically undone all of the good parts of the entire series.  Luke is killed off in the most useless way\\, Han is killed in an even more ridiculous way and Leia is obviously winding down\\, due ot her real-life death.  It's a just a mess.","true":true}
