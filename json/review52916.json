Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"An excellent step in a new direction.  J.J. Abrams introduced us to the new cast\\, but Rian Johnson made us fall in love with them.  The film bridged the gap between the old and the new long enough for the old cast to seemlessly pass the torch to the new cast.  The Last Jedi subverts all expectations in storytelling and technique.  I was previously a fan of the old canon and was apprehensive about the new canon even after the release of The Force Awakens.  Now I can safely say out with the old and in with the new\\, because the story and emotion portrayed in The Last Jedi is far superior to any Star Wars stories we lost in sacrificing the Legends material.  Additionally\\, this is the first Star Wars movie was the most effective in terms of using nostalgia not just to have something there\\, but to actually accomplish something.  The feeling I personally experienced during the movie's binary sunset was one that I will never forget\\, for in that moment I knew exactly what was going to happen and I did not want it\\, but I accepted that it needed to happen.  Thank you\\, Rian Johnson\\, for making a truly amazing film!","true":true}
