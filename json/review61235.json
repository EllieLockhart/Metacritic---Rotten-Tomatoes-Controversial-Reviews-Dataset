This game had really great gameplay. But the story is incredibly pathetic and petty. I truly believe Naughty Dog wants gamers to forget about Joel in the **** manner possible. 'How come?' you ask me. Well it's Joel who taught Ellie how to play the guitar\\, handle a gun and self-defense. And when the game starts in Jackson Joel was murdered by Abby. Then near the end Ellie egged Abby to fight. Abby bites off Ellie's two digits so she can't play the guitar anymore in the epilogue. She even has a change of heart in finishing off Abby so lets her off the hook and denies us the satisfaction of exacting revenge. But no Ellie wasn't meant to be saved because she was supposed to be the cure for the pandemic. This is every kind of messed up possible. When she returns home to find her lover Dina long gone and can't even play her guitar properly during this depressing apocalypse\\, how much more depressing can this game get? Of course she leaves her guitar behind\\, which is symbolic of leaving Joel.\r\rA new beginning I suppose... I definitely won't be getting TLOU3 if that ever comes out.\r\rGameplay 9\/10\rStory 0\/10\u2026 Expand","true":true}
