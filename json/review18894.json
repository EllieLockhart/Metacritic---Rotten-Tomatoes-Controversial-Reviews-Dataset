Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's as if the cut The Empire Strikes Back and The Return Of The Jedi all into 1 film...There's so much they could of dove  into from the expanded universe to make a new movie but no they decided too take 2 of the original trilogy films and put them into 1 film....I didn't think anyone could ruin star wars more then George Lucas(by re-cutting then re-releasing the films)  But clearly Rian Johnson now has the title of that claim....","true":true}
