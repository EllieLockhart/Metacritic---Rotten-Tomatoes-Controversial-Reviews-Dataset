Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi pays homage to Return of the Jedi in premise\\, but departs from the mistakes of Force Awakens by avoiding from the \\\"soft reboot\\\" feel of its predecessor. While the movie feels closer to OT than any other SW film\\, it strikes its own identity with one of the most thrilling conclusions of any installation in the saga and builds anticipation for its sequel better than any chapter to date. While a few characters and subplots feel forced\\, the overall storyline takes the saga in a fresh new direction that few anticipated. Beautifully choreographed\\, stunning visuals\\, and excellent character development. This film's exploration of the nature of the force and the legacy of the Skywalkers has earned it a place among the most thrilling installations in the franchise.","true":true}
