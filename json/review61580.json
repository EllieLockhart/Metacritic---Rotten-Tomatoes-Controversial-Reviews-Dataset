The story is compelling\\, unfortunately it has been criticized for his LGBT content inside\\, and yes\\, it seems to be politically deployed\\, but who cares? We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I apologize if i make mistakes\\, english is not my main language.\r\r1. There is no improvement in the game except for it's graphics and the new dodge mechanic that is completely broken and makes melee combat an ez pz task. Graphics are great\\, the gameplay is the same as in tlou 1\\, so there's nothing to talk about.\r\r2. The story is poor and full of \\\"what a coincidence\\\" moments and inconsistencies. Ellie is traumatized for torturing 1 person after killing thousands of them. I mean: WHAT\\, REALLY?\r\r3. The only point in the story is this \\\"cycle of vengeance\\\" metaphor. great clich\u00e9\\, doesn't explore further\\, doesn't even bother developing anything else\\, not a single good story neither for the wolves or the scars\\, just different groups fighting for territory.\r\r4. Abby doesn't kill a person that has travelled all across a city to kill her\\, just because? that without saying that Ellie killed everyone she cared about\\, of course. and SHE DOESN'T KILL HER cause it's Ellie?? OH BUT WAIT\\, she didn't have a problem when she had to travel all the way to Jackson to kill Joey. And all of this\\, for what? So Ellie can go after her AGAIN. TO LET HER LEAVE. Really? Ellie has a problem killing Abby but not all the people in the middle? this is ****\r\r5. What a piece of **** of an ending. But that's just my opinion.\r\r6. Lastly the game is so desperate to call attention that all of its main characters are LGBT\\, like saying \\\"look at me\\, i'm inclusive\\\". All non LGBT characters die. Except for Tommy just: BECAUSE. Even if he was shot in the eye. LGTB characters? no\\, we can't kill those. Look at me\\, i'm an inclusive game.\rMy question is: will there ever be a game that treats LGBT stuff as normal and not as a resource for screaming \\\"look at me?\\\". Suddenly it subverts all the machism and turns itself in the complete opposite type of game where all the character are either gay or empowered woman. Do we really want this to become the new \\\"strong guy\\\" ppal character for all the coming future games? will there ever be a middle-point?\r\rMy real note would be a 5\\, but seeing that people is just giving it 10's without reason i'll give it a lower note\\, i think it kinda deserves the review bombing.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
