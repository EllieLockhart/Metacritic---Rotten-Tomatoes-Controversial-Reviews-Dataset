Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"News\\, critics\\, and some people need to stop trying to defend this pile of crap. WORST STAR WARS MOVIE. Rian was trying to appease this snow flake generation. He should never be allowed near the SW Universe again.","true":true}
