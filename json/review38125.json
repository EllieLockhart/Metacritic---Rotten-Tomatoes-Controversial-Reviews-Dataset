Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The story was well-done\\, for the most part. But I think\\, more important than that\\, is the fact that Rian Johnson was not afraid to do something different and write something truly new to add to the Star Wars canon. He broke away from tradition and wrote a new movie\\, rather than rehashing something that the Star Wars audience is already familiar with.","true":true}
