Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Most inconsistent mess of a movie. It has no interest in building plot lines\\, characters\\, or the Star Wars Universe. It's more interested in manufacturing contrived tension and drama by using the force as an over-the-top plot device and also making characters act in no way understandable or empathetic. \\nSo many boring and non compelling scenes where the movie feels like its holding you by the hand so it can tell you a stupid irrelevent monologue about society. The Canto Bight sub-plot completely wastes the audiences time and keeps us from watching the main plot so we can learn about how rich people are all jerks and how we should save animals from captivity on a planet that we ARE NEVER GOING BACK TO. Why would we spend so much time trying to save animals on a planet that we're never going back to??? The animals are just going to get caught again by the casino people. Yes\\, some rich people can be bad\\, but why should the audience care when our main plot has ABSOLUTELY NO TIE IN TO THAT??? Post modernism and Star Wars do. not. mix. Stop this meta garbage and go back to exploring the Star Wars World and the wonderful characters that we got from the OT and TFA.","true":true}
