Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have viewed the film in two different communities a large city and small town before writing my comments. Reactions from the audience were the same\\, people laughed\\, cheered and applauded and there were even a few tears at the end.The story was surprising Luke\\, our hero has made a mistake with terrible consequences. The overall vision is of hope. The Jedi continue.","true":true}
