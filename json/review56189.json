Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars episode 8-The last Jedi- Directed by Rian Johnson\\, expected by many and high expectations\\, does not disappoint\\, the film lasts more than two hours but it keeps you stuck to the seat from start to finish.\\nIn the visual\\, the special effects as always well achieved\\, combining with photography\\, the artistic edition\\, and the music of the master John Williams\\, who leave it bright.\\nThis new episode reminds us of Master Yoda's teaching times\\, making it clear that strength\\, within the galaxy\\, is everywhere and that independently of the Jedi\\, it exists in all of nature\\, and in any person.\\nAnd that's how Rey\\, the daughter of some junkyards\\, has the power of force at the same level as Kylo Ren himself\\, descendant of the Skywalkers\\, at the same time giving rise to the possibility of more history within the Star Wars universe and not only focused on the Skywalker lineage.\\nThe film has more humor and new characters that do not clash as Jar Jar binks did in his time\\, Luke also in this installment appears with more humor than usual\\, even though in past films did not see that of him\\, not out of tune.\\nAs for the story and the script can be said to be interesting\\, there are surprising and unexpected moments\\, if you could say that some loose ends were left that could have joined in this episode to give more depth to the story\\, although we do not know if it was simply left for the next and last episode of the trilogy.","true":true}
