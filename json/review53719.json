Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"George\\, \\\"You are the only hope\\\". TLJ is an insult to classic star wars fans. Disney\\, go create your own SJW propaganda space movie. CG and music is good\\, and I have to treat it as a separate Disney space movie in order to finish the whole thing. My star wars memory is DEAD!","true":true}
