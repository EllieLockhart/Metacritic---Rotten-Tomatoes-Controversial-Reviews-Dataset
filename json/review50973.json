Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolute garbage. The fact that not only murders the old characters and universe\\, but introduces an incredible number of plot holes into the universe is just the icing of the cake.\\nExcluding an (admittedly) outstanding use of color\\, the rest is garbage. Characters are shallow\\, the plot is nonsensical PLUS additional\\, even more idiotic sub-plots.\\nIt looks like a badly written TV-series\\, in which the twist is introduced for the sake of it.\\nAll the epic feel of the old movies\\, or at least the clumsy campiness of the prequels\\, is lost.\\nThis is the movie that killed Star Wars.","true":true}
