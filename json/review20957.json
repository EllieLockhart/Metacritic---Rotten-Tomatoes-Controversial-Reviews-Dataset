Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was glad to see the story was a little more original; that it wasn\u2019t just a complete reboot of a previous episode (like The Force Awakens). However\\, they didn\u2019t capitalize on the main idea behind the story. Overall it felt very loose and thrown together without much substance. A lot of useless subplot added\\, and forced humor. Don\u2019t get me wrong\\, it wasn\u2019t all bad. There were a few scenes that definitely made my hair stand out of excitement. I was entertained\\, but sorely disappointed. I\u2019ve seen worse movies for sure\\, but this is one of the worst if not the worst Star Wars. ","true":true}
