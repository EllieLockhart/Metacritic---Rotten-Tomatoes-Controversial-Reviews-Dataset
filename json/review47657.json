Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"When a movie lacks exceptional character development\\, has a Disney princess wielding a lightsaber who is omnibenevolent and apparently omnipotent and is facing down someone she's already beat twice\\, turns a space opera into a quirky space comedy\\, introduces Porgs as if there was no backlash to cute creatures who actually served a purpose\\, weakens\\, dumps on\\, and ghosts one of the greatest heroes in film history\\, forces a \\\"love\\\" story that is incomprehensibly lackluster\\, and is forcefully and abrasively shoving diversity propaganda down my senses (diversity is important\\, but I just feel like there are other stages that can have more effective results; however\\, I think it's a cool thing to do\\, I just wish it was more subtle)\\, I look to enjoy the movie as entertainment. It was entertaining and had some great moments. I love Star Wars\\, and can be picky as hell. This was someone else's vision and I think it's cool that they got to see it become a reality. 3 Stars because I enjoyed watching it for the most part.","true":true}
