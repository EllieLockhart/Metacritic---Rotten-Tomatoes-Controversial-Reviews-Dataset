Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Episode 7 left me wondering how Episode 8 would answer the questions posed about the characters\\, and Episode 8 left me wondering not much of anything other than what Episode 9 might be about.\\n\\n*Spoilers. Enjoyed seeing 40yrs of setup paid off with Luke's story\\, even with his Naruto-inspired final move. Fin and Rose's story could have been completely cut out\\, being an elaborate setup for Benicio. Also the slowest chase scene ever didn't help\\, and while I love the idea of force-Leia\\, the execution felt like uninspiring wirework. To cut down length\\, give Fin and Rose a more central role but stay with the group (not running an errand during a 'chase'). Introduce Benicio earlier and have him on the run with everyone\\, falling back to the mining planet at the midpoint. Meet the force-orphans there. Then\\, thinking they're safe\\, Benicio gives away their position and bails for money. Enemy led by Kylo closes in on them AND the force-orphans. Luke's big trick has bought time for both Rey AND Holdo's big finale as the cherry on top of that (like Han coming back AS Luke approaches death star hole in hope. Climax those things together). Seems like they're doing a Twilight love story with Rey's force struggle (Kylo\/Vampire\\, Fin\/Werewolf)? Would really have liked to see that third lesson. Needed that to make more sense of Rey and Luke's turn if it was indeed the 'save them' lesson described by Director Rian Johnson. Needed that beat of Rey seeing Luke as Kylo did\\, lost and without hope.","true":true}
