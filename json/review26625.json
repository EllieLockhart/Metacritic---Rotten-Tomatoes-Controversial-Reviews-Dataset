Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Okay\\, so I've seen this movie three times now\\, and it's official\\,.. I love this movie. Without giving away any spoilers\\, I'll just say that I was expecting certain things coming out of The Force Awakens; and after my first viewing\\, I wasn't really sure what to feel about it. There was so much great stuff here but I didn't get one thing that I was expecting. And while I suspect that many who saw the film felt the same way\\, and as a response\\, felt somewhat underwhelmed or just plain robbed; the more I think about this move\\, and what Rian Johnson does here\\, and what he adds to the Star Wars universe\\,.. it's truly so much more than he ever took away! .... At the end of the day\\, I realized that the problems that I had with this movie at first aren't really The Last Jedi problems\\,.. they're The Force Awakens problems. J.J. Abrams delivered a Star Wars movie\\, that while great and entertaining as a Star Wars film\\,.. it ultimately did nothing for future.  installments except set them up for disappointment. The Last Jedi not only unravels the mess J.J. left it\\, but it sets up what is sure to be a quite satisfying\\, intense and monumental finale when we get to Episode IX. This now ranks third in my favorite Star Wars films following only A New Hope & The Empire Strikes Back. If you love Star Wars or even if you're just a casual fan\\, you'll be doing yourself a disservice to skip this movie\\, and see the possible future that Star Wars may create for itself with truly creative and bold people at the helm. And may the Force be with you!","true":true}
