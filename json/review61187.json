We knew it wasn't a happy ending at all.The game calls Joel's morale into question\\, however he and Ellie gain our affection.\r\rThis sequel plays more with morale and perspective on the situation\\, in theory\\, so that our opinion is broader and not just supportive of one character. However this is a dirty move\\, this tactic only creates a conflict within us.\r\rAt the end of the campaign I feel mentally broken\\, sentimentally bad\\, with a desolate ending. Yes\\, I learned more about revenge and forgiveness\\, the consequences of decisions\\, and how the world is still a place where the strongest survive\\, where there seems to be no good or bad.\r\rOnly a couple of moments didn't quite convince me\\, and the little weight of the music (compared to the first title) were the bad details to highlight.
