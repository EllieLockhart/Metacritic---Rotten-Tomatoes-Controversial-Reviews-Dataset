Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"While I have small criticisms with this movie I extremely enjoyed it. I watched in anticipation of just about all of it. Our new lead characters all had significant character development. We got new worlds\\, new characters\\, ships\\, and creatures. Visually I think this might be the most stunning Star Wars to date.","true":true}
