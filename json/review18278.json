Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I thought the movie was alright but not great.I also hear a lot of people and reviewers saying that if you didn't like it the first time you may like it beter the second time\\, but I feel like you don't have to watch a movie two times just to like it beter the second time\\, it has to be just goo the first time. BUT that is just my personal opinion.","true":true}
