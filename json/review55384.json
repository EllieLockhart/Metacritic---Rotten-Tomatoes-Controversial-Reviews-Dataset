Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved the visuals\\, loved seeing Adrian Edmondson... and that's about it.\\nStupid story\\, stupid jokes\\, no respect to the original cast and legacy\\, nothing fleshed out\\, just adding more confusion to JJ's stupid mystery box and so much more negative things..\\nNot a bold and new direction\\, only a wrong direction. \\nJust give it back to Lucas and call it quits","true":true}
