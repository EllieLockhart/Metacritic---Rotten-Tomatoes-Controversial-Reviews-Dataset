Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really wanted to love this but I couldn\u2019t. Corny dialogue (even by SW standards)\\, poor character development\\, and too many plot holes to count. The pacing also felt incredibly rushed\\, like Rian Johnson was trying to see how much he could cram into a 2.5 hour run time without much regard to the overall flow. The end sequence will probably be extremely disappointing for most longtime fans\\, as the rich and vibrant characters we have come to love over the past 40 years are completely disregarded and cast aside. Although there are certainly some great moments\\, amazing special effects\\, and a great score\\, TLJ falls well short of living up to the hype surrounding it. Time will tell where this entry ranks in the list of best-to-worst SW films\\, as Episode IX could help provide some much needed answers and context to this installment.","true":true}
