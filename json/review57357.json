Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie made JarJar seem like a dream. Created an account just to review this movie. It's painfully slow with SJW propaganda blatantly thrown at the audience. Entire scenes with a \\\"message\\\". I'm amazed they didn't have someone in engineering on the rebel ship pop in to say fuel won't be a problem\\, it's a hybrid ship. I can't believe they put this out and are comfortable charging people to watch it. The blame falls solely on the writers and director. The actors aren't at fault.","true":true}
