Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many things didn't work in this movie\\, yet it had great potential. It felt rushed\\, and as if the movie consisted of nothing but a few mashed up story lines and an attempted crowd pleasing roster of characters that felt hollow and disengaged from what was happening. The movie should have focused more on Rey and her training\\, or the interesting interactions between herself and Kylo Renn\\, not this awkward mess of a plot that was Finn and Rose and for christ sake watching them kiss was awkward and the romance was clearly rushed as a desperate grab for the audience to feel sorry for an injured Rose. (Not spoilers no one cares about her>) Furthermore Snoke was an anti-climax in his entirety\\, and that purple haired commander?? In conclusion\\, don't recommend\\, only go to see the unrealised potential this film had.","true":true}
