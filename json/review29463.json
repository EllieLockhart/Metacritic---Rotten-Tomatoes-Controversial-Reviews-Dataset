Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson has gone to the roots of what made Star Wars a relatable to millions around the world that the force is among all of us. Here's to hoping that people would go on to appreciate the movie years down the line.","true":true}
