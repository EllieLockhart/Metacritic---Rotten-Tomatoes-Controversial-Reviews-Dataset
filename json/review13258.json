Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t understand why it is getting such bad reviews. There are some issues I had with the movie due to plot holes\\, but I very much thought the movie redeemed the force awakens which I thought was a major disappointment.","true":true}
