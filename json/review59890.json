Ever bullet or arrow that you receive and dish out has weight. The design and sounds of the infected\/zombie like enemies will make your skin crawl. The human enemies are interesting because they all have names. Sometimes it was frustrating when you stealth kill an enemy with a silent range weapon (bow or silent gun) and the AI can instantly deduce which direction you are with with out checking the body. However that's the only negative thing about the combat in my opinion. My only other nitpick is that their was only  one part where you could freely roam a large map. I originally expected several sections like this but another one never came. Obviously the story and acting is amazing. The ending was heavy. This game is a clear 10\/10. Not sure why people are review bombing it\\, this game is clearly brilliant. 10\/10.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
