Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Never before has a movie been such a disappointment to me\\, nothing but loose ends\\, bullshit \\\"twists\\\"\\, plot holes\\, and missed opportunitie. The entire movie spits in the face of 40 years of star wars fans\\, disney is the worst thing to happen to star wars. Star Wars is dead.","true":true}
