Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie was complete Trash. The tomatometer is shit\\, this website is liberalized trash. (not talking to politics) Introducing Holdo and giving her a roll we could have easily given akbar. The mary sue. Underutilized look\\, this is literally hte worst movie i've ever seen.","true":true}
