Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This film is a dazzling\\, stupid mess...so many pointless subplots filled with leftist poltics\\, bad puns\\, terrible\\, LAZY writing\\, and contradictory plot holes.\\nBeware if you're a diehard Star Wars fan who cares a lot about the original characters too. I had low expectations going in based on user reviews and was STILL let down. Avoid this if you enjoy good story telling and interesting characters!!","true":true}
