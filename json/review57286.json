Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie is a mess\\, even more than The Force Awakens it feels like a cliche Hollywood comedy-action-romance with Star Wars slapped on it. Doesn't follow the story from the last movie\\, bad jokes\\, blatant political agenda and plot holes made it thoroughly unenjoyable for me. I never felt the excitement I had for other Star Wars movies\\, simply because the atmosphere was non-existent. Oh and Daisy Ridley's over the top facial acrobatics\\, it looks horrible and reflect badly on her as an actress.","true":true}
