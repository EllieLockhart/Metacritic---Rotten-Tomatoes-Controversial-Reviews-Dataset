Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a great film. It gave me hope of a good reboot after what JJ abrams did with TFA. If there's hate against it\\, it's just by the side of trolls and newbies.... totally would recomend to see\\, without judging prior to see it.","true":true}
