Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's fresh \\, i've seen it 3 times now and i have to say it only improved for me\\, the first time i saw it i was disappointed \\, but now i can say it s a masterpiece !!!!SPOILERS AHEAD !!!! I'm a huge Star Wars fan and i can say that i loved TLJ on second viewing (bcs first time i went with some expectations and than realised that those things aren't important \\,like Luke \\,he had a story \\,he had his moments of greatness even in this one and the way he died was so poetic looking at the 2 suns. His arc was completed \\\"peace and purpose\\\"\\, after a long life of danger and sadness... Rey's parents\\, if i would go from 7 straight to 8 i wouldn't care for her parents bcs they aren't important\\, anyone can have the force ) it s great \\,but star wars fans only want or expect something from these new films and when they get something different that start hating on it. The movie was astonishing \\, spectaculary filmed \\, well acted \\, with good CGI \\, good battles and a damn good choreography. So just bcs Luke vanished \\, Rey parents aren't  important and that Snoke \\\"died\\\" the way he did the movie is bad ?!?...yeah Leia flying through space is bad\\, the Finn and Rose story-line is a bit boring and the lightsaber sound was off\\, but other than that it was amazing and can't wait for episode 9.?","true":true}
