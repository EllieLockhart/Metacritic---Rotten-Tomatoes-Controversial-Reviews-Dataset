Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I feel like I took a venture into a weird nerdy 8-year-olds\u2019 insane imagination. I wanted to see Star Wars and ended up getting politics. I had to use the restroom during the middle of the movie and I didn\u2019t even care. My family and I went on and on about how awful it was. The new Star Wars is a joke that isn\u2019t funny. Star Wars is over.","true":true}
