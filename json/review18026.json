Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think there are a lot of things with this movie which came as a shock and they didn't go in the direction as I thought they would and Im really glad that they picked this way instead","true":true}
