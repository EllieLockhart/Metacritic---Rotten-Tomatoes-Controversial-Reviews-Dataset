Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a disappointment. \\nThe story went nowhere and I didn't care about any of the characters.\\nThere was so much potential to create a compelling story but it was wasted through laziness of the writers and director.\\nThis trilogy needed a good story to begin with where it all started with Luke being a powerfull and charismatic old Jedimaster which led the succesful Jedi academy and Han and Leya still were maried and that the evil and menace not came from an empire version 2 as I call the boring new order but for example from an invading  evil ancient race from outside the galaxy with force powers or something like that. Would be at least much more interesting but they wanted to play it safe.\\nVery boring movie and I am sad for Mark Hamill.","true":true}
