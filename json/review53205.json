Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars movie to date. \\nBrilliant acting\\, beautiful scenes\\, lots of tension\\, character building and the best of all\\, a feeling of going where no one has gone before in this franchise (sorry for the Trek pun\\, just watched TNG back-to-back). \\nThis movie is anything but the safe choice\\, and for that I think it's the best of them all. \\nThose giving 0-1 stars wanted the safe choice\\, too bad. I applaud the director and Disney for daring to take it in an entirely different\\, original direction.\\nBy the way\\, some of those 0-1 star reviews sound as if the end of the world is nigh. Chill man\\, it's just entertainment\\, not religion. \\n\\nWARNING Spoilers ahead!\\n\\nKilling Snoke was the greatest twist I've seen in a long a time in any movie. And clearly something diehard fans didn't like\\, yikes. Here's the thing: Killing Snoke was like demolishing everything you thought you knew and starting over with an inexperienced Rey on one side and Ren on the other. You got these two new powerhouses and you have no idea how it will turn out. \\nOh\\, and the fact that it was Kylo who killed Snoke was the best part of it all\\, and felt so right considering he's a Sith. People complaining that it made no sense need to get their head out their asses and realize that he saw an opportunity and grabbed it. Now he's the master. That's the Sith in a nutshell. \\n \\nEvery time I've walked out of the cinema after having watched a Star Wars installment I've been stoked for the next one\\, but I also pretty much knew what was going to happen. With this one I have no idea what to expect from the last installment in two years\\, and to be honest that's freaking awesome!  That element of surprise\\, of not knowing what will happen or how the next chapter will form itself is something I've never experienced with Star Wars. As a fan\\, I think that is the strongest part of TLJ. \\n\\nThis movie could not be any fresher.","true":true}
