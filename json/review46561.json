Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Watching the new younger generation trash my childhood\\, drag it through the dirt\\, throw my heroes in the bin and re-invent what didn't need re-inventing is crushing.  Gutted.  Script really sucked and was full of holes.  We end up with new bland characters\\, intriguing ones discarded\\, a whinging brat as the main Sith \\\"lord\\\" and not exactly much to look forwards to from now on.  Don't even mention the space Leia scene .. my only hope is that one day the kids get their favourites franchises destroyed by the next generation and ask for forgiveness.","true":true}
