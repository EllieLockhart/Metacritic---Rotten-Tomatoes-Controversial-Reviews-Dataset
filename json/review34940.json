Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The film is well executed. The story isn't. Previous subplots are resolved unsatisfactory\\, characters are out of character\\, some subplots are completely unnecessary (looking at you Rose and Finn)\\, some drag on. \\n\\nSpoilers section\\nThe biggest questions and anticipation characters fans had going in are completely ruined. SSnoke\\, Luke\\, Rey's past\\, Kylo Ren\\, Pho (forgot how to spell his name)\\, Finn - all ruined for fans. \\n\\nIf you aren't a fan\\, u might like it. I am a fan\\, I don't like it.\\n\\nLuke's first scene where he throws away the lightsaber feels like exactly what Rian Johnson did to the Star Wars lore\\, established story\\, and all that. He took all we loved and threw it away like he didn't care.","true":true}
