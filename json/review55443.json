Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"meh. How long will it take to see a star wars movie where all the main jedi\/sith are at their full power?  So far\\, we've gotten a couple of minutes of qui gon\/maul and obi wan\/anakin... and after patiently waiting through the emperor speechiying for an hour\\, a couple of minutes var\/luke before luke decides to just stop....  Screw Kylo\\, give us a battles of full blown jedi against a bunch of sith - not that arena B.S. against a bunch overmatched moths from attack of the clones.  And for the love of the almighty\\, write an interesting character who isn't whiny or constantly worrying about their effing place in life.  Imagine if Han Solo was a jedi and go from there.  #itsnothard #lastjedi","true":true}
