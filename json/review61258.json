Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"People need to chill with the 'all these negative reviewers haven't played it or they hate LGBTQ; nonsense.

The expansion to the first game\\, which has Ellie kiss her female friend\\, was reviewed and liked very well by both users and critics. Don't discount negative reviews as most of us have played the entire game and no reviews mentioning things like 'agenda' or 'SJW.'\r\rThis game is nowhere near the masterpiece it is touted as but it's not a terrible game either. I appreciate Naughty Dog for attempting to push the boundaries of emotional intensity but while this is praiseworthy\\, they failed spectacularly. The characters could all be interchanged with their motives\\, and no one would know the difference. Ellie\\, who you would come to love in the first game as a spunky\\, lighthearted but caring person is devolved into whatever it is they call a character. I do understand why they wanted to go this direction with the story\\, but it's so poorly done and contrived. Ellie's voice actor's talented was wasted by this script.\r\rThe gameplay overall was quite fun for the first 10-15 hours but puzzles they used in the first game\\, are too far and few between here. It soon gets stale and if that isn't bad enough\\, they throw a huge tonal shift at you and expect the same gameplay to carry you through for another 10 hours or so. That being said\\, the environment design is amazing and it does make Seattle feel like it's own character. What they did here was nothing short of amazing. I think most people would like the story beats and feel it compelling for the first half of the game and does have some pretty good moments. Overall\\, I'd say I'm ok with the beginning and ending of the story\\, but getting there was emotionally painful and unpleasant to play through. This is a videogame first and foremost after all and thus I can't give it a positive score for any of it's redeeming qualities.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
