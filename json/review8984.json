Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"From the first 5 minutes of the film to the final scenes\\, I cringed every moment. Characters have no development\\, the story has no direction whatsoever\\, and the poorly placed comedic relief just made things worse. As a big fan of the Star Wars films (including The Force Awakens)\\, this was a thoroughly dissatisfying film. I can't fathom how critics found this movie enjoyable. The difference in the audience score and the tomatometer is staggering\\, and speaks for itself.","true":true}
