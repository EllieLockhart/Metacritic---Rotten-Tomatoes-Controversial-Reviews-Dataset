Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"How was TLJ refreshingly different from the other Star Wars movies? Kylo Ren's change of heart to rescue Rey from Supreme Leader Snoke? It's exactly like the scene where Darth Vader turns on the Emperor to rescue Luke at the end of Return of the Jedi. Surely the writer-director Rian is aware we've seen the earlier movie?","true":true}
