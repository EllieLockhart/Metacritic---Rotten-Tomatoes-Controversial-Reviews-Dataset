Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My biggest complaint in Force Awakens was that it lacks originality. It was just an Episode IV with a new twist\\, not presenting something really new. This time we can actually experience new ideas\\, on a dynamic that was not seen in a Star Wars ever before. It's a great\\, solid and exciting story that does not play safe\\, and that's the whole charm of it. If you see this movie without being strained with nostalgia\\, actually wanting some new perspective\\, chances are you will enjoy this movie deeply.\\n\\nIt's not perfect though. Some characters and plot points were undeveloped. And they did focus a lot in fan service moments that make people scream in movie theaters. I loved some\\, but there were just too many.\\n\\nAnother controversial thing was that some Star Wars taboos were broken. Definitive and epic answers won't be seen here\\, and we'll learn a thing of two of classic characters that we didn't expect at all. Some people will love this plot twists\\, while others will feel that the movie was reckless. I guess it will depend on how much you are open for changes and your understanding that Star Wars it's not just for you\\, long time fan\\, but also for a whole new generation.\\n\\nAnyway\\, it's a great movie in my opinion. See it with an open heart!","true":true}
