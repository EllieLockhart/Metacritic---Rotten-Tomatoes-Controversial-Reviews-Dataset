Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The magic of the original series was in no small part due to the chemistry of its actors. Like many\\, I have waited to see Ford\\, Hamill and Fisher together again on the big screen since 1983. Now it feels like I've forever been and completely cheated of that.\\n\\nThe reasons to despise this movie are too many to list. The new characters are paper thin and should\\, at this point\\, have been fleshed out by now. The story line is all over the map and has left me feeling like \\\"who cares what happens next\\\". If you are one of those people who are impressed by tons of CGI and battles that make no sense at all\\, this movie is for you. Otherwise\\, to have the Star Wars brand on the front of this movie is an insult. \\n\\nThe only thing that can save this franchise now is to have the USS Enterprise come crashing in through a wormhole to join the fight against the First Order. Unless that's in the next script\\, I'll gladly wait to see Episode IX on bluray.","true":true}
