I will go over Until Dawn through some main points.\r\rSetting:  It provided a dark\\, creepy\\, nerve wracking setting with the mines\\, to an equally tense and foreboding atmosphere of a comfy lodge to an empty dismal one. The forest itself seems to swallow you whole at times. There were plenty of items to bring the deathly stillness and ominous feelings to a higher level. Everything from skulls\\, dried blood\\, broken furniture\\, rusty saws\\, creepy paintings\\, high stairways and enhanced this. Whenver I had to walk around\\, my eyes were constantly roaming around\\, trying to see through the darkness or determine whether a chair was a dead body or something.\r\rCharacters: There was a good variety of all sorts of personalities in the cast. You'll hate some\\, you'll love some. All I can simply say here\\, is that the characters had depths\\, their dialogues with each other felt very real and they were relatable. I liked everyone personally except for Emily lol. But kudos to the voice actress and scriptwriter for succeeding in making her be so disliked.\r\rSounds: Creepy and dark background music\\, accompanied by screechings really tickles the hair on one's neck. It was fantastic. I also like the music that played on Jessica's cell. The sounds of crunching feet in the snow and other movements were also very accurate\\, and helped alot with immersion.\r\rStory:  Without spoiling\\, I'll say the story was pretty crazy (in a good way) and it really hooked me to keep playing. You're constantly going forward in hopes of surviving\\, but there's also a secondary curiosity on what the hell is actually happening. The game provides good detailed clues to push the story forward and it really shows how the past affects the future. I enjoyed it immensely\\, though I wish we got to play certain characters alittle more. We know too much about some\\, like Mike\\, and not enough for characters like Matt for example.\r\rShortcoming: It'd be nice to able to run. Like seriously. If my loved one was in peril\\, I'm not gonna walk around like I'm taking a stroll. Secondly\\, already mentioned\\, having more equal playtimes with all the characters would be niced. Being able to explore Josh's head more was very desired. The character's relationship bars also needed to play a bigger role in the game. Also\\, the jumpscares were alittle overplayed in the game.\r\rOverall\\, I would definitely recommend this game to fans of the horror genre. It's entertaining\\, very human\\, suspenseful and very enjoyable to play.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
