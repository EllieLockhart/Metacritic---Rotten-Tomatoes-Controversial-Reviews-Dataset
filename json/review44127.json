Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"to anyone who honestly believes that they are happy with the \\\"direction\\\" that the new star wars installments (bar Rogue One) are taking\\, i would advise you look no further than the plethora of groundbreaking Star Wars Short Films that can be found on youtube. Despite-or no doubt\\, because of the low budget and minimal production\\, these films are able to delve into the complexities of this vast universe\\, while Supreme Overlord Disney works only to keep the masses emptying their pockets. There is no artistic integrity left in a world like that. I pray they don't rape X-men the same way that they raped Leia in this abortion-esq installment. The way to the future is backward.","true":true}
