Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The new films do not feel like traditional Star Wars film and that is the main problem IMO. Rogue One did need ot feel like other Star Wars films because it was meant to be unique and a stand alone film that sets a trilogy in motion.\\n\\nTFA and now TLJ have been extremely underwhelming\\, TLJ even more so. As bad as Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace each were\\, I would put TLJ on par with them. It's story was weak and had WAY to many \\\"Funny\\\" scenes in it. I don't recall to many instances of hilarious scenes in any of the Episode 1-6 films yet this one seems to have one every couple of scenes. \\n\\nSo much of the story you are given information that seems relevant however is never expanded upon and the actions of the character seems ver OUT OF CHARACTER for some. Other subplots\/relationships seem extremely forced and not natural like they felt in the previous films.\\n\\nTLJ did have\\, arguably\\, one of the best fight scenes in all of the Star Wars films but it also had an incredible weak villian. Once Rian Johnson explained his decision for the villian it made his creative choice feel even more pointless. \\n\\nRian Johnson has done more damage to the Star Wars saga than any of the prequels could have possibly done.\\n\\nI do not have high hopes for his trilogy and frankly\\, can't believe Disney thought this was a good film. I would put this at a 3.8 to maybe a 4.5 out of 10\\, and I would rate is slightly better than AotC and TPM\\, but Below TFA which I felt was about a 6\/10.","true":true}
