Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Went into the film with high expectations but left felling robbed of what could have been a great installment. The pacing is all over the place\\, people in power make very stupid decisions for no reason. Some sequences drag on horrible long. Questions from TFA are just glazed over and push to the side. Who are Rey's parents?\\, who is Snoke? They have so much promotional material for characters that have 2 mins on screen....Looking at you BB-9E. It's not as cringe worthy watching as the prequels\\, but it's not in any way as great film.","true":true}
