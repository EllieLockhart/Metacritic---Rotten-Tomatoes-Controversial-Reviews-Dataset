Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I went to see this movie as a continuation of the mediocre episode 7\\, but this movie throws every plot thread to the wind: who are the knights of ren? how is rey so powerful? why did luke leave a map to be found? who is snoke? \\nSpoiler warning: Snoke Luke and Ackbar die\\, and nobody in the movie makes a big deal about that. why should we?\\nAlso\\, males are either stupid or or weak or evil\\, while female are wise or strong... sjw anyone? and why did rose and finn save the animals but not the children?\\nfinally I would say that humor is too hamfisted in this movie\\, it really comes off as a lot of cringey jokes that kill what fun could be had by the movie. 1\/10 for me\\, disney please consider making this movie non canon","true":true}
