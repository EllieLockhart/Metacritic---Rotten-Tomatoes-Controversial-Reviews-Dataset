Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*NO SPOILERS HERE*\\n\\nIt's evident there's a disturbance in the Star Wars fandom.\\n\\nBut\\, honestly\\, there's ALWAYS a disturbance in the fandom.\\n\\nStar Wars fans are among the worst when it comes to never being happy. It's simply impossible to make a product that's universally beloved by all the fans. Except maybe the OG trilogy and that's simply because they were the first.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is all about breaking down myths\\, tearing down the established walls that is Star Wars and planting seeds for new growth.\\n\\nIt does so shockingly. It does so rather mercilessly\\, at times.\\n\\nWriter\/Director Rian Johnson takes big swings narratively with this story. Whether it connects with you is another issue\\, but it can't be said that there's a genuine attempt to show us something NEW.\\n\\nChange is hard. Most people react to drastic change kicking and screaming.\\n\\nAnd this is where we find ourselves\\, now.\\n\\nLook\\, if you hated this movie with every ounce of you\\, fine. It's your right to feel that way. But\\, the swarm of hate is NOT reflective of the collective fanbase.\\n\\nI've been a fan all my life. Star Wars\\, like countless others\\, has always held a special place for me. I too was both wracked with excitement and dread the moment Disney announced they were buying it and making more movies.\\n\\nThe Force Awakens did not work for me. I got it. It was Star Wars. Felt like Star Wars\\, but did it offer anything new? Truly? Or was it a remix of everything we know and love about Star Wars?\\n\\nThe Last Jedi does away with that. It changes the way we know Star Wars. I'm of the camp that feels this change is for the better.\\n\\nThe reason it isn't a perfect score for me is it is a bloated movie\\, with some needed trims in the editing to shorten things up. \\n\\nSee it for yourself and decide for yourself.\\n\\nI'm excited for the future of Star Wars.","true":true}
