Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"- Huge unanswered plot holes \\n- Terrible story and back story\\n- Awfull new characters which added nothing to the film.\\n- Leia flying like superman \\n- Snoke awful death scene \\n- Luke Skywalker terribly written.\\n- Rey's built up back story and Power\\, insults any previous Jedi as she is Powerfull because Kylo is so the balance makes them equal\\, who wrote this seriously? Training\\, time\\, experience\\, natural ability and bloodline make strong Jedi\/Sth\\n\\nFire Rian his is garbage!!!\\n\\nNice way to kill Lucas film\\, perhaps go work with EA \\n\\n\\nRian wants firing and ?? don't give this idiot his own trilogy for god sake!!!","true":true}
