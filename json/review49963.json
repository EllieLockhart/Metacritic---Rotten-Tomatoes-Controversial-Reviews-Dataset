Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"You may notice a curious\\, common writing style among all of the positive reviews on here. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re phony but I\u2019m also not saying the writers or the director have any idea how to make an interesting movie. It had a few bright spots between Rey and Ren but for the most part\\, all the hype and fan theory debates were FAR more exciting and interesting than what was delivered. Dud. ","true":true}
