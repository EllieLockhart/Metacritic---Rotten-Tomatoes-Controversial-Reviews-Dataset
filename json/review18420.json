Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It is a shame I can't give 0 stars. Because this film is not even worth this amount. The SJW propaganda throughout the entire movie in itself was enough for this score. You got smacked in the face with it\\, to such extend that it gets anoying and distracts from the (poor) storyline. The story itself\\, especially if you are familiar with the previous movies\\, made no sense whatsoever. Disney absolutely ruined the Star Wars franchise\\, I will not go to the last one. And funny enough there is no need to see the last one\\, because the story is so badly written. There is no set-up for the last movie..","true":true}
