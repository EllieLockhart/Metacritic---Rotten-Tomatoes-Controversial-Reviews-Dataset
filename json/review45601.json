Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very Disappointing. Somebody is asleep at the wheel at Disney\/Lucasfilm. The First Order decides to \\\"follow\\\" the last few rebel ships down rather than send in the tie fighters to finish them off\\, because they're out of range of cover fire from the capital ships? Seriously? This is the foundation of the entire movie. WTF? Shit writing.","true":true}
