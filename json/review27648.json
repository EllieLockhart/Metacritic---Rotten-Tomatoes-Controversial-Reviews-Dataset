Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Painfully bad. Mary Poppins in space. A Casino scene that should\u2019ve been in the extended version. Arms dealing? Really? This movie was bad for a the same reasons Phantom Menace was bad. Preachy and boring. I can honestly say not only is this The Last Jedi but it\u2019s also the last Star Wars I\u2019ll ever see in this trilogy. Hopefully they do a prequel with Ewen McGregor as Obi Wan\\, but other than that I\u2019m done. ","true":true}
