Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a terrible movie! The only thing I enjoyed was the popcorn. I understand that there is a need to usher in the next generation of characters. However\\, to destroy the character of Luke along the way\\, is totally unnecessary. Very un-Jedi like. The characters was also flat. Kylo Ren continues to appear a spoilt brat\\, with nothing menacing. Snork\\, becomes a side prop\\, and you question why he's in the movie. Rey\\, is also a flat character who becomes all powerful with a burst of force steroids. The casino scene was too dragged out and unnecessary. The capital ships chasing scene which is dragged out\\, also doesn't make a lot of sense. They have killed any desire to follow any Disney Star Wars movies. I will hold onto the old movies\\, and direct my kids to those. We will not be spending any money on Star Wars toys and merchandise related to the Disney Star Wars movies. ","true":true}
