Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So many missed opportunities... Snoke\\, dead or not was a waste. Luke ruined. Leiah should have died. No Lando on the casino planet?!? Force ghosts interacting with the real world and weaponized light speed changes the entire franchise.","true":true}
