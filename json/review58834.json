Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"I finally got around to finishing the game about a month after its release and I made sure to stay offline and avoid all spoilers.  I was truly surprised to find such negative and hateful user reviews online.  I thought the game was beautiful.\r\rMy one gripe is the major halt in the story when you switch characters mid-game.  I feel like there could have been a better way to structure the pacing there\\, that was very jarring.  But these negative reviews saying a \\\"political agenda is being pushed\\\" or that there is blatant disrespect to established characters.  None of this is true.\r\rIf you got to the end of the game and were unable to see that literally every character is the villain in someone else's story\\, you missed so many points.  If you're a hateful person and you think the fact that there is a trans character or gay characters means there's an agenda being pushed on you\\, grow the hell up.  I feel sorry that you're THAT insecure to think someone is forcing an agenda on you.  This game simply shows the humanity in every character\\, shows our own personal biases (some more so than others\\, clearly).  I hated Abby at first\\, but the more I got to know her and her story and her OWN personal tragedies I realized Joel was the villain in her story.  She was driven by the same rage and obsession than Ellie was later driven by.  It's disheartening that so many people missed the point\\, simply because one of their favorite characters died.  Sometimes the Ned Stark character dies\\, everybody.  Play the game\\, decide for yourself.  Don't be swayed by online incels and bigots.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
