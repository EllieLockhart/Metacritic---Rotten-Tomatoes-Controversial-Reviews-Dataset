Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Loved this film. Not sure where all the hate is coming from for this film. I think many fans have forgotten that this is not The Original Trilogy 2.0. It is a new trilogy and the main characters are all the new characters Rey\\, Finn\\, Poe\\, Kylo and Rose. Luke\\, Leia and Han are passing the torch to the next generation. Their story is done and this was a great way to pass the flame on.","true":true}
