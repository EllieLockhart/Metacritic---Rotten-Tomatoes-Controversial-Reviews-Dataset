Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved the movie soooo much! It's different and yes it has its flaws but i was able see passed it. The character developments were on point. I can wait what going to happen to Rey and Kylo's relationship. Their scenes was really the most interesting part of the movie.","true":true}
