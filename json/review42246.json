Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie sticks with you but for the wrong reasons. It lingers with you and eats away at you. The plot holes\\, the humor\\, the giant dump they took on Luke Skywalker. I woke up the next day thinking I had a bad dream where they made the most bizarre and frustrating Star Wars film to date. But it was no dream. When the Last Jedi ends\\, if feels like the sequel trilogy is going absolutely no where fast. JJ has his work cut out for him with IX\\, and hopefully Disney learns their lesson after choosing some mediocre director to take complete control\\, while throwing every SJW trope into the mix as well. I needed to take a bath after sitting through this 2 and a half hour garbage fire. How does Rian Johnson sleep at night knowing he turned Luke Skywalker into a cowardly kook of a character? Watching Disney take over Star Wars has been like watching a slow motion plane crash into one of the most beloved franchises of all time and completely destroying it. Absolutely bizarre and sad.
