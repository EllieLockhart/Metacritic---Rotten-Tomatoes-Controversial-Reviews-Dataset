Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian tried to be revolutionary but it didn't pan out.  Rey and Kylo force texting\\, Finn and Rose's adventure unnecessary and convoluted\\, and the late great Carrie Fisher channeling Star Lord in space :( .  Sorry none of that was ground breaking.  On top of that.  The Supremacy could have ended the Resistance by making a light speed jump adjacent to their vessel.  Luke's pessimistic disposition was interesting\\, but a turned Kylo Ren destroying him (psychologically) isn't a convincing reason. Rian seemed to do the impossible--bridge ambition with lazy writing.","true":true}
