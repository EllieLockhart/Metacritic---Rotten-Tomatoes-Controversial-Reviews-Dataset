Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I saw this movie on midnight release\\, the theater was full but not as full as you'd expect\\, it was a perfect setting to see this movie. The film makes incredibly bold decisions that offer high risks in favor of high rewards. The movie will divide fans\\, it will anger many\\, it will inspire bigoted comments and self pretentious demands\\, but it opens pathways that will help stray off from the formula that will not age well as time goes by. For any fans claiming the film is not a star wars movie for disrespecting the originals\\, get off your high horse and expand your horizons. The film series can live without the ideas of the Jedi and Sith\\, it can live without the overwhelming presence of the Skywalker family\\, and most importantly\\, it can live without the overwhelmingly toxicity that spawns from the opinionated \\\"fans\\\". Disney did not ruin Star Wars\\, it's helping it adjust through these changing times. What's ruining Star Wars\\, is the fans.","true":true}
