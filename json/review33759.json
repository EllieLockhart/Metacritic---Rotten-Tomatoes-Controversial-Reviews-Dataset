Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible new characters that were introduced and terrible direction of old characters that we have seen before. This movie does nothing but rip apart a fan base and accuse long time fans of being dumb\\, racist and sexist. DO NOT waste your time with this movie. Even as a huge fan\\, I am disappointed I wasted money to see this.","true":true}
