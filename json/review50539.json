Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"(1) The importance of Luke and Leia to fans who grew up with Star Wars clearly means nothing to Rian Johnson.  Leia was my hero\\, she was the only heroine of her kind in the 80s.  Rian Johnson completely made her useless.  BIG F you to that. (2) Luke goes against his nephew\\, even though he was willing to sacrifice himself for the evil of the galaxy - Darth Vader\\, but...what was that with Ben Solo?  (3) Bombs drop in space?  Uh...do you have any science knowledge\\, Mr. Johnson? (4) What's the point of Canto Byte when all one person had to do was share the plan?  (5) And\\, finally\\, Rey is NOBODY?  She can beat Kylo with no training at all\\, and she's related to nobody?","true":true}
