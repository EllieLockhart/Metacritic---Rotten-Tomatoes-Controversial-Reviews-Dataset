Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly thought The Last Jedi was a great movie. Mark Hamill's acting was spot on\\, and the overarching theme of destroying those you hate vs. saving those you love was intriguing.\\n\\nI also liked how the characters grew\\, whether in their resolve or their understanding of what it takes to keep their cause going. Good humor\\, and great action and story.","true":true}
