Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily the best Star Wars film for me since Empire Strikes Back\\, not quite as good as it but easily better than Return of the Jedi. Natural evolution of the characters; Luke and Kylo in particular were brilliant\\, great additions to the overall mythology of the universe especially in regards to the way the force works\\, and the musical score was classic John Williams.\\n\\nMy only real gripe was that Finn's story felt completely unnecessary\\, wish they gave him something better to do and someone better to do with it because Rose was about as interesting as a plank of wood.\\n\\nCarrie Fisher was pretty great too\\, I was very surprised at their handling of her... feels like they didn't change her role in the film at all due to her tragic passing.\\n\\nGoing to miss her a lot in Episode 9.","true":true}
