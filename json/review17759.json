Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It did to the Star Wars franchise what The Crystal Skull did to the Raiders of the Lost Ark. Plot was a mess. It didn't develop characters and had pointless gotcha moments that detracted from any hope of a narrative arc. It was worse than The Phantom Menace.","true":true}
