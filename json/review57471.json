Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was super fun! I'm an average Star Wars fan\\, and there things I really enjoyed seeing and some things that didn't make a lot of sense\\, but overall it pays off. \\n\\nPositives: \\n- I really enjoyed Luke's character and storyline. At many moments it felt like I was a kid again\\, especially during a specific scene with Luke (you'll know what I'm talking about). Mark Hamill has an awesome performance.\\n\\n- Poe's storyline was interesting  and unexpected\\, and it kind of fits into this broader theme of needing to fail to grow. I really liked his arc.\\n\\n- The score was amazing. \\n\\nWeird things:\\n- Poorly timed humor at few moments\\n- Timeline was absurd\\, if you sit back and think about how all the events tie together in such a short period of time\\, it doesn't make sense.\\n- A lot of things they set up in the Force Awakens have unexpected and ultimately underwhelming pay offs in this one.","true":true}
