Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is the worst movie of the franchise... horrible storytelling\\, useless characters... it's all just a pathetic slap in the face for the fans. Do not buy the DVD\\, do not go to the theaters for this one... EVER... after this - don't go to the theaters for the next one as well\\, or it will not get better!","true":true}
