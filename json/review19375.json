Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's rough if you love classic star wars. They made sure Luke was the last Jedi but didn't give him the send-off he deserved. Also in their expedience to kill off the past story elements and franchise\\, they destroyed anything that was worth anticipating for in the next film.\\n\\nThis was my biggest gripe Luke wouldn't hurt a family member if he was willing to sacrifice his life for his dad on the off chance he had goodness in him. \\n\\nMaking rey a nobody is also dumb. No training and she is a master by the end of the film is also dumb.\\n\\nIt was a shameless cash grab\\, that dashed any hope for the next installment.","true":true}
