Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"it was good\\, but be real meat and potatoes. story was okay\\, but was bland. Luke was best down the cast each did there own thing. It could of trimmed the movie by 30 minutes\\, just a lot of fool in scenes ","true":true}
