Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie did not do anything for me. At first when I left the theater 2 years ago I did not know what to think I thought the graphics was good. Then I watched it again watched youtube videos about how bad this movie was and it all made sense. Why this movie is one of the worst pile of shit I have ever seen in my entire life. I would rather watch the Room on repeat for 3 days before I watch this movie ever again. If I watch the sequel trilogy again (*which probably won't happen cause F this trilogy) I want to know how any one enjoyed this movie and what the critics were thinking giving this movie better then a 90% When this movie started I knew I was in for a long run. When Luke through the lightsaber was so dumb it pains me ever seeing it again. Also how he wanted to kill Kylo Ren even before he did anything bad was some of the worst crap I have ever seen. Do not get me started on the stupid sub plot about Rose and Finn. Rose is one of the worst characters ever created. Also how she saves Finn at the end she should have died it would have redeemed her character a little bit. Also how Leia flew in space was dumb as well. Nothing in this movie is worth watching again. The graphics were the only good thing which they should be as they spent so much money on these films. I don't give half 1 or zero so I give it my lowest score a 1 and it is rotten to the core and you should never see this Star Wars movie once.","true":true}
