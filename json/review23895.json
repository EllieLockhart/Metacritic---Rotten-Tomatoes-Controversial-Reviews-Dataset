Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Make no mistake\\, this movie is getting paid critic reviews to boost its rating. This alone should scare the shit out of you. They are going to bastardize what you love\\, force feed it to you\\, and tell you the whole time that everyone loves it so if you don't like it you should question your own identity and opinion. Sickening.","true":true}
