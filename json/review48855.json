Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst stars movie ever. Such a shame that this movie was so disappointing. No real storyline other than the worlds slowest space chase\\, underdeveloped characters\\, everything that had been built up in the previous movie that was starting to look interesting was simply thrown out. Too much of it just made no sense unless everything that happened before episode 7 is just removed from canon. Felt it was completely disrespectful towards the original cast members and new characters like Finn's storyline felt forced (pun intended) and unnecessary. Newer fans might like it but overall it was an extremely underwhelming movie for fans of the originals.","true":true}
