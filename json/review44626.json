Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Totally hideous new characters\\, silly misplaced humorism that totally annihilates any sense of gravitas. The overall feeling is alienating and the suspension of disbelief completely suppressed. Toy Story has higher moments of suspense (when they are about to be incinerated in the dump for example) and infinitely more likeable and believable characters. Watch that instead!","true":true}
