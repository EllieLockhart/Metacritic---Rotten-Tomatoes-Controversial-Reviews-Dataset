Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The last disappointment truely ruined my hopes. I came in hoping for dark movie with highlighted points\\, but was truely mistake by the lack of writing and connection to any other Star Wars movie and lore. The jokes felt forced apon and mis-timed. While the darker tone was ruined by some plot hole or misinterpreted information. They truely ruined the key characters with Luke Skywalker not being the one I grew up with\\, Princess Leia not dieing in the scene where it would make her death legendary and heroic\\, Kylo Ren being so under powered and mistreated to how fans want to see him\\, Rey becoming so powerful without a detailed character sub plot\\, And so many others. Though it had some beautiful scenes and well executed tones and moods it lacked basic compliance with previous Star Wars films.","true":true}
