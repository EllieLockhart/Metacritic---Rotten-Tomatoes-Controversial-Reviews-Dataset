We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"All right\\, folks\\, I'm not saying that this is the worst game ever just because of the death of Joel or because of Ellie transformed into a stupid selfish a**ole character\\, but I made an account here just to say that this game is literary one of the most disappointing games in the history of mankind because the events in the plot pop up out of nowhere and happen so randomly without any preparation and they make no sense. Repeat after me\\, they make no sense. Any moron can write a story that the plot happens as they dream without reasonable facts. The thing that makes a story legendary is that the writer is so talented that gives you logical reasons for any event they show\\, otherwise anyone\\, literary anyone can write a story. The true art is to find the acceptable reasons for what goes on in the story to make it feel real. On the other hand\\, the art is not just wishes of a psychopath mentally ill person like Neil Druckmann who just wants to convey his personal thought about life to the audience by using a masterpiece as his microphone\\, no matter how the first game was\\, no matter what actual theory the first game had\\, and no matter how the characters of the first game were developed and defined. As you see\\, he is using games to express his thoughts and ideologies about life; he doesn't care about the first game. He just sees it as a tool. That's what he did with the trailer. They showed us Joel in the trailer\\, they used Joel to hype us\\, to motivate us to buy the game\\, but in the actual game\\, Joel has no effective part in the game and dies at the very beginning as a stupid careless no experienced person.\rSo\\, I'm saying this aloud: I hope Naughty Dog removes Neil Druckmann from the company\\, otherwise\\, that's the company's end of awesomeness.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
