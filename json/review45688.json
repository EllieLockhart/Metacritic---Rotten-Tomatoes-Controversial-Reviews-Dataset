Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very fun and enjoyable movie. Lots of Action and very diverse characters. I loved the creatures that were featured in it. It is difficult to believe that after so many star wars movies over the years they can still keep your interest. I was very pleased and very much recommend it.","true":true}
