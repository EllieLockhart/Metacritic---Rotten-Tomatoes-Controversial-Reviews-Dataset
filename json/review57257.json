Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie had every but of being the best Star Wars yet ..but with a heavy heart I have to say it was not ..it was very disappointing . there are a few moments of nostalgia but other then that it's not good at all.
