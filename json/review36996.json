Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was solid\\, had some powerful \/ awesome moments. I really feel like this was setting up the next installment but did it in a great way. The humor took away from it a little but I appreciated the attempts.","true":true}
