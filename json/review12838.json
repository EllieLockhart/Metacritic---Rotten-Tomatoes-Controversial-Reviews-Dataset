Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I didn't dislike the movie but the film was not made for the real Star Wars fans\\, this is more a Ryn Johnson's movie where he puts first his vision that what the audience wanted to see. If you are a true Star Wars fan\\, prepare to see something really different to the things that we love","true":true}
