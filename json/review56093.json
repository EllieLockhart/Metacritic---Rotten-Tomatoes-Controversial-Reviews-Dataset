Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sometimes tense\\, sometimes beautiful\\, sometimes precious\\, but never reverent\\, the Last Jedi is my forte of this new wave of Star Wars films.  The final act in particular was breathtaking and delightful.  I know many people are feeling the Star Wars fatigue\\, but I felt that this film struck the perfect balance of acknowledging the lineage from which it draws its history and its fans while also forging a new path. It was the most fun I've had at the movies all year. (side note: the creature design is perfect and thankfully enhances rather than hijacks the movie)","true":true}
