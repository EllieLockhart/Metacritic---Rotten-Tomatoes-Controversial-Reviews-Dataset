Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi was something different that we've never seen\\, but for the wrong reasons. Disney definitely destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker with the uncharacteristic thought of killing his nephew.  One top of this horrible portrayal of Luke\\, everything we were given in Force Awakens was thrown away by Rian Johnson. The questions: Who is Snoke? Who are the Knights of Ren? Why's Rey so powerful? were never answered. And the side mission with Finn and Rose was literally unnecessary and had no payoff in the end.","true":true}
