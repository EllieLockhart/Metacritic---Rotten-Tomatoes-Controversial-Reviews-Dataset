Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a true masterpiece of Disney with the attempt to fuck off all fans of the original Star Wars trilogy\\, that has died the day it went from George Lukas to this giant of the western film industry in the attempt to milk as much money from this cash cow without ever feeding it. \\n\\nFunnily enough the HOPE for a much better outcome has led me to watch all three makings of pseudo Disney SW! \\nBut NOW\\, I am so grateful to Disney for convincing me with it's third deconstruction of the original Star Wars idea\\, that their products are just not worth a penny. I needed to leave the cinema after 60 minutes of awful suffering and found \\\"The last Jedi\\\" to being a random collection of distasteful scenes without any proper meaning or connection to Star Wars.\\nI mean just because the cover states \\\"Star Wars by Disney\\\" doesn't mean there is Star Wars as appreciated from George Lukas in it\\, right?! \\nSo\\, yes this was a bubble ripe to burst. Thanks very much for the wasted money and crashed hope. With best regards to Disney and it's full message: \\\"We can't produce any great film\\, and for sure we do NOT qualify for any high quality film product that could prove to be true to the original meaning of Star Wars.\\\"","true":true}
