Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Let's list the meaningful symbols: Red\\, white\\, and black. The light saber. Everyone's hands. The jewelry. I could go on. This is a fantastic movie made richer than almost any other Star Wars movie by its thoughtfulness\\, attention to detail\\, and awareness of the literary tradition. It has a high place not just in the Star Wars canon\\, but the Western canon.","true":true}
