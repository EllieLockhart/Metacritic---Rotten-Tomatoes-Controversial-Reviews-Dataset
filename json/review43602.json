Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was not Star Wars when judging this movie on story\\, character development\\, and plot. It seemed as though this movie was purely based on pushing political and social ideologies than good storytelling. They killed Snoke who was a great bad guy. Whom by the way stated how he could read Kylos mind. If he knew that he would have known what he was up to. Also Luke would never attempt to kill his nephew. It completely goes against what the Jedi stand for and what was taught throughout all 7 films. Now if Luke was conflicted with the dark side himself like what was done in the Dark Empire comic that would at least be better storytelling. Also yoda does ancient Jedi book burning when he strikes lightning at the tree. That's what the nazi's did in WW2. Burning knowledge is always a bad thing and that goes against what Yoda stands for and taught for 800 years. Among other bad story choices.","true":true}
