Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It\u2019s a major stain on the Star Wars Legacy!! I was so excited to see it....first in line at midnight showing. Less than 1\/2 way through I started thinking why was this movie ever made?? I wish I could erase it from my mind!! People are worried about spoilers...... what a joke..... there\u2019s nothing to spoil because nothing even happens in the movie!! The biggest disappointment was Luke!! This is what we get after waiting nearly 35 to see him in action after ROTJ?? I did love the porgs though...... If you are a casual Star Wars fan or moviegoer you will enjoy it....if you are a true Star Wars fan you will be disgusted. Shameful!!","true":true}
