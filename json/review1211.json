{"101487":104532,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2018-01-02","3":1,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Apologies for grammar\/ineloquence; I'm slightly drunk and very angry\\nFirst of all\\, I wan't to say that from an aesthetic point of view\\, there is some cool stuff. But\\, if I'm honest\\, eveything looked too sleek and Hunger Games esque. Laura Dern with her silly purple hair and the the tomboy asian girl who 'gets shit done'  just gave the film a young adult vibe which I don't think is at all appropriate for this universe. The weird\\, out of place cellphone joke and the 'ur mom' comment from Poe immediately set of alarm bells. Flat humour is common throughout the film unfortunately. Rogue One perfected the rugged\\, ancient\\, almost LOTR like quality of the universe. Take note RJ.  \\nNow\\, as a Star Wars fan\\, this film is pretty much blasphemous. I appreciate th subversion of the norm or post-modernism in art in the general sense. The problem with RIan Johnson's film is that it is apparent that he is trying hard to be edgy. I could feel the snarkiness\\, the smugness\\, the arrogance\\, the cynicism and the condescension oozing off of the screen. It's pretty clear that TLJ is a low-key \\\"F U\\\" to Star Wars' core audience from Rian Johnson. This is present in all the themes about 'burning' or 'killing the past' or Yodas glib remark about the Jedi texts 'not being page turners'\\, an obvious stab at the Expanded Universe which holds a special place in mine and other SW fans' hearts. I could write pages bemoaning the treatment of Luke but others (including Hamil himself) have already done that. I'll just say that Luke's character was completely and unjustifiably soiled in a variety of baffling\\, unnecessary ways.  Also\\, the subtle attacks on masculinity weren't appreciated\\, Rian. Maybe you were a nerd who got bullied by the jocks at highschool\\, maybe you want everyone to know how virtuous and progressive you are. I understand. You're only human. But could you not have chosen another property to rub you're political bile over? On that idea\\, the whole Poe vs Haldo storyline didn't make any sense. The only message it relayed was 'discard your toxic masculinity\\, submit unquestionably to the political elite'. That's not healthy message\\, however you slice it. Plus it just doesn't make any bloody sense and I shouldn't have to explain why as others have done that as well\\nContinuing the theme of RJ giving the finger to the fans\\, Snoke is fcking wasted. His character didn't go anywhere interesting. This was a very deliberate\\, cynical and calculated response from the almighty Rian Johnson. I'm sure life is busy in your ivory tower RJ\\, but take a moment to see things from te perspective of a fan: We spent 2 years theorising about the origins of the character\\, pouring over concept art and EU storylines. It was a great time to be a Star Wars fan. It strengthened  the community\\, reignited our passion for the universe and filled us with optimism and excitement for the future of the franchise. It got a little out of hand\\, yes\\, but that only demonstrated the strength of the fandom. Snokes ignominious\\, abrupt and unsatisfying death was an INSULT\\, a fist to the bollocks and you know it\\, don't you RJ. You must think you're so avant garde. And then of course we have Rey's parents. You really shat the bed with this one Rian. Yes\\, the concept of great power coming from nothing is poetic and resonant but you didn't follow through from TFA and it shows. The implied message about how the force isn't a master race thing and how anyone\\, even a stable-boy\\, can be a Jedi was cute but THIS WAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN THE CANON AND YOU WOULD KNOW THIS IF YOU ACTUALLY GAVE A RAT'S ARSE ABOUT STAR WARS. You threw away a potentially intruiging storyline for the sake of weak\\, tired message and another  *\\\"F U\\\"* to the fans. Can't you see how this devalues and de-mystifies the universe\\, knowing that you changed things just to 'subvert expectations' and deiberatley anger the fans? Can't you see how disillusioned people already are with the direction Disney is taking Star Wars? You're wiping your arse with the brand. How does it feel Rian? If by any chance you come across this\\, I would appreciate it if you addressed my points and explained in detail your thought processes to this film and justify them in a public statement or something (no need to credit ?). I could give you many more reasons why this film is awful but my head hurts\\, I've ranted long enough and there are plenty of others who would do a better job than me. Please\\, please just focus on making a cool Star Warsy Star Wars film that isn't a rehash or giant middle finger to people like me. Is that too much to ask in this day and age? It's too late for Luke\\, admiral ackbar and many others I suppse. At least make something genuine for you next trilogy. Thanks for reading this.","true":true}
