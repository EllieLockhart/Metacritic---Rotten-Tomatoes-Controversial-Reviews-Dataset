Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was great. The ones hating on it are the ones who had their theories dashed over and over again. Theories since 2015. Go in without expecting your theories of who Rey is\\, who Snoke is\\, what Luke's up to etc etc to be true\\, and you'll be fine. Build the movie up in your head to be a certain way and you'll have a bad time and write up a salty (no pun intended) review.","true":true}
