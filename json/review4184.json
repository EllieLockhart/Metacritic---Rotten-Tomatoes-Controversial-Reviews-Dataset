Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"By deifying its erstwhile heroes and not capturing fresh ground\\, the franchise lost an opportunity to become more relevant to its fans. No one really cares for Princess Leia (now Queen eh?!) and Luke Skywalker much now. There are bigger stories to be told. This effort turned out to be pretty timid.","true":true}
