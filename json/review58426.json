Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great addition to the saga\\, though not at all what anyone expected it would be. I believe almost everyone had huge expectations for this one\\, and while I recognise that many feel theirs were not met\\, mine certainly were\\, just not at all in a way I thought they would be. Sure\\, there are parts that could be shortened a bit\\, and while the whole Canto Bight sequence may at first seem useless\\, but it does set up the conclusion at the end of the chapter\\, and it shows us that the heroes aren't always going to succeed at what they're trying to accomplish. It also did serve a purpose in having Finn and Rose bond and develop a relationship which clearly will carry on into the next chapter.\\n\\nSure\\, the movie isn't perfect\\, but no Star Wars movie ever was\\, certainly not the prequels\\, and not the original trilogy. Even Empire Strikes Back\\, which is widely hailed as the best of them all\\, some even call it the best sequel in any franchise\\, but that movie also has a lot of issues throughout the whole film\\, but it's still a really great movie - just like The Last Jedi.\\n\\nI understand why a lot of people don't like it\\, but for me hit the sweet spot on so many levels\\, and I can't wait for Episode IX to bring it all home.","true":true}
