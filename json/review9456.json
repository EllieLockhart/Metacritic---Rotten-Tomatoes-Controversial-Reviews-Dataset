Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Go in with an open mind and leave pleasantly surprised. It is a great installment with some of the most epic moments in a Star Wars film ever. Just because it does not match the film fans built in their mind for 2 years does not make it a bad movie or a poor Star Wars tale. And don't let anyone spoil it for you!","true":true}
