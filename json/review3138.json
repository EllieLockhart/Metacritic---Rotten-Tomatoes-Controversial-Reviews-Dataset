Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ballsy! Rian takes all of our expectations and even some previous themes of heroism and turns them on their head. He leaves behind a unique and profound installment in the Star Wars saga with bold choices\\, powerful themes and strengthening old characters and bringing us new ones. This film takes chances and has been shunned for it; but undeservingly so. Not since empire strikes back have I been able to be so constintly surprised by a Star Wars film. A little slow and meandering at times but for he most part\\, an entertaining and enlightening time at the movie theatre. I feel inspired by Rian's Star Wars story and hope I can give him a high five one day for delivering what I think is one of the best Star Wars films yet!","true":true}
