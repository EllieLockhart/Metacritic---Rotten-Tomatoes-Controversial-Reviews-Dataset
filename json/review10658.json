Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Had high hopes for TLJ\\, but in the end was fairly ambivalent when I left the theater. In the following days when thinking about the film\\, I became  annoyed by how poorly made it was from a storytelling perspective. It seems that RJ has never seen any of the original SW films or for that matter TFA. (Yes\\, I know he has.) This film pretty much deconstructs much of what the original trilogy built and ignores all the world building that has been done through the first seven films\\, two animated series and countless novels. On the positive side it had some very cool visual scenes and I like Rey\\, even though RJ does not bother to explain how come she's so overpowered with the force with zero training. On the negative side it was filled with lots of plot holes\\, poor character development\\, lots of unanswered loose threads from TFA\\, humor that was for the most part not funny\\, villains that were bafoonish and incompetent\\, a ridiculous jaunt to Casino World\\, needless social justice posturing and last but not least\\, Leia Poppins.  If this film is any indication of what RJ has in store with the new trilogy then I will sadly take a pass.","true":true}
