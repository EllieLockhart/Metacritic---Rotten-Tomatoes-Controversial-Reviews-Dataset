Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Subverting paradigms is like a chorus in a song: if you have ONLY a chorus with no counterpoint\\, the song is no good. Similarly\\, if you subvert EVERY paradigm\\, you are left with nihilism. This was actually worse than Phantom Menace. At least Phantom Menace left the basic moral underpinning of the Star Wars universe intact. It doesn't even work as a film not connected to Star Wars. Even without considering any other film in the franchise\\, the plot of this movie makes no sense. Characters do things for no reason. There is no character development\\, there is no causality\\, the rules of this space fantasy universe are as flexible as hot rubber. Literally nothing in this movie makes any sense. Just to add some insult to injury\\, every single thing Star Wars fans have loved for the last 30 years is systematically deconstructed. It boggles my mind that anyone can post a positive review of this. I'm not even going to get into the tremendous amount of politics that were badly shoehorned into this film for no reason. Just stay away.","true":true}
