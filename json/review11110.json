Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Hi\\, I am Rian Johnson and I wrote the apologetic review that begins with \\\"This will be my final review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi\\\" that I signed it with the name \\\"John C\\\".\\nIt is time for everyone to know that it was me.\\nYou already noticed that I feel compelled to explain what I did with the movie because I was not able to express it while I was making it.\\nI am an amateur movie director. I have done only two movies before The Last Jedi and an episode of Breaking Bad which is\\, by any means\\, the worse episode of the series.\\nI think Kathy hired me because she knew that I would have crapped in my pants and that the movie would have been a disaster.\\nShe wanted exactly that.\\nNow I know and I apologize. I didn't want to hurt anyone. I hope that someone will give me the opportunity to do other movies\\, although no one will pay for watching them.","true":true}
