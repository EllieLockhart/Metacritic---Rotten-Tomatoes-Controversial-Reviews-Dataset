Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account on here just to add my displeasure at this travesty of a movie. There is one problem though. Why can't I give it negative stars? If any movie ever deserved to go into negative percentage it is this one. Shame on you Kathleen Kennedy and Disney","true":true}
