Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson creates a fantastic journey into the galaxy far\\, far away in this film. With excellent character development\\, stunning visuals\\, and thought-provoking philosophical quandaries\\, this film creates depth while still delivering on the Blockbuster fun. Johnson grasps the Star Wars universe and portrays it much more faithfully than J.J. Abrams did in The Force Awakens\\, while wrapping up the open ended questions that Abrams left hanging. This film is definitely worth the watch and is a wonderful addition to the Star Wars saga.","true":true}
