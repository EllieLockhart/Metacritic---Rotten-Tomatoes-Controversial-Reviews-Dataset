Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disney has killed star wars. I watched a 2 1\/2 hour commercial for kids toys. That whole sub plot with Finn and Rose was pointless\\, only there to step up the end scene with the slave boy with a broom... I'm so disappointed. The theme of the movie was story doesn't matter\\, just buy star wars merchandise....  No set up for episode 9 so no reason to see it... after 30 years of fandom\\, I'm done.","true":true}
