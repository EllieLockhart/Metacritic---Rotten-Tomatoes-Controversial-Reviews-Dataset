Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This Movie laughs in the face of all the Fanboys!  And that makes it great\\, Its Star Wars people\\, its supposed to be fun and surprise you.  GO see it!  you will love it if you don't take it too serious.  If your worried about who Smokes father is\\, then\\, maybe you need to get a life!  It was perfect.  Well done!","true":true}
