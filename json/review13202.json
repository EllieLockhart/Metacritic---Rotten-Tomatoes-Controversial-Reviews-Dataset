Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don't think people are mad cos it's too different. It's because we were set up for some interesting questions that had unsatisfactory ends. We wanted Rey to be someone (I'm torn on her being a nobody) we wanted snoke to reveal his past and see how he manipulated Ben from Luke\\, we wanted more forceback reveals\\, we wanted the knights of ren\\, we wanted Luke to ignite the green lightsaber and kick some ass\\, we wanted Rey to be tempted by the dark side and maybe be this grey Jedi\\, we wanted benicio del toro to be someone better than a cameo\\, we wanted the first order to actually be a competent enemy not just looking the fool every film. Plus some of the humour was jarring.","true":true}
