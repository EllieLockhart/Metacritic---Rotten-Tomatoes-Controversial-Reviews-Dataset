Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I like the risks this movie took! Is it perfect no! Does it deserve this bad rating?! No\\, because the movie is great! The bad ratings continued from this to Solo\\,because could not let go of the hate! The hate for this movie I will never understand! I thought it was a great addition to the saga to a tired formula that old Star Wars wanted to be in The Last Jedi so bad! Guess what \\,they didn\u2019t get what they wanted and I\u2019m glad! Force Awakens was nothing but a retread of \u201cA New Hope\u201d! They ate that nostalgia up like candy! I have to admit I did too! This movie is better than Rogue One and Solo! It\u2019s just \\,hardcore fans bashed and ruined this movie before it came out and people painfully overlooked it like it was garbage! It\u2019s not garbage it\u2019s a good addition and you will be entertained by it! This user rating is unacceptable! This movie is a lot better than a lot of other movies! Bashing on Star Wars think how wrong that is! Phantom Menace deserves it\\,but not this gem! ","true":true}
