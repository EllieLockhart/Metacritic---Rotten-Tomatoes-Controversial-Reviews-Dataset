Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The first act of this movie was sloppy. The final act was somewhat enjoyable.The Force Awakens was a much better \\\"Star Wars\\\" movie and flowed a lot better. This movie was choppy and included a subplot that was boring and a complete waste of time. \\n\\nThe humor is very much like that of the Marvel movies and is completely out of place and not fitting with George Lucas' story telling style. Although there were good moments in this movie (hence the 2 stars instead of 0)\\, they do not make up for the convoluted and rushed first half.","true":true}
