Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Last Jedi makes Phantom Menace look like a masterpiece.  I came out of this movie so angry and disappointed\\, and frankly cheated.  Disney has officially taken the beloved Star Wars franchise so far off the tracks from which they may never recover.  Disney should pull this piece of crap out of theaters and apologize to fans who went and saw it.  Oh and it's clear the critics that gave this such rave reviews are clearly being paid off by the movie industry.  No objective person could review this film and give anymore than 1 or 2 stars.  As far as I'm concerned these critics have no credibility after this.  Save your money and watch this thing when it hits Netflix.","true":true}
