Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS FOLLOW-- Just bad; I didn't like the 'comedy' at the start such as Luke throwing the lightsaber behind him\\, didn't like the Finn and Rose plot at all\\, Laura Dern's character was so unlikable that her change to good wasn't fully effective (why didn't she just tell Poe the actual plan??)\\, too much CGI\\, it ruined General Hux completely and wtf was that Mary Poppins stuff??","true":true}
