Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A complete and utter disappointment. It failed on so many levels--from lack of character development\\, completely unnecessary scenes\\, too much quippy humor...the list can go on and on. The Last Jedi does nothing to build upon and improve the Star Wars universe.","true":true}
