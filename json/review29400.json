Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson did a good job keeping with the tradition of the original lucas trilogy\\, but adding his own modern new twist. Quite surprised audience didn't like it\\, but I think the expert critic reviews will help make this one hold strong over time. It played above my expectations.","true":true}
