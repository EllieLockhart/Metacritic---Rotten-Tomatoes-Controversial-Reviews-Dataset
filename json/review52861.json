Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Amazing movie\\, haters will see whatever they want in it. I saw no political agenda\\, only a good movie that managed to surprise the heck out of me. Not a derivative of ESB\\, like Force Awakens was of ANH. It was an original idea taken in a direction I never expected but loved none the less. Luke SkyWalker was done so well\\, and there's even a very special Cameo by everyone's favorite puppet with wise words to help our former hero back to a good path. The best Star Wars movie to date in my opinion\\, RIP Carrie Fisher.","true":true}
