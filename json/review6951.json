Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the best of the series\\, Makers of the movie decided to put as many new staff in the picture as possible. Even though there are couple of dumb moments you will forget about them by the end. The story telling is done is such a way that you do not know what will happen next. Felling I thought I didn't think I get to experience again.","true":true}
