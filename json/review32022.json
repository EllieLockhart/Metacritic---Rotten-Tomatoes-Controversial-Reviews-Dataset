Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"*Spoilers* Honestly\\, I really did enjoy the movie. The graphics where great\\, and the plot was interesting. I did feel like Snoke was poorly used. If you're going to use an actor with the talent of Andy Serkis who has the ability to get the attention of the entire crowd with just a few words\\, don't have him in three scenes and kill him off. If that's the only reason for the character existing\\, use someone that no one will care about losing. I also do feel a bit cheated by Disney's lack of use of the original staff in not just this movie but all of them so far. All of the trailers and hype made you want to see Luke and what he will and can do\\, we see little of both. He did not give the impact that he or the fans deserved and was killed off way too soon. R2-D2 didn't even get five minutes of screen time while C3-P0 was seen periodically throughout the entire movie. Even Chewbacca was subjected to minimal amount of screen time\\, only seeing him briefly in the beginning and end of the movie. As a whole\\, The Last Jedi a good movie. For a movie that's supposed to be introducing a new generation\\, it does well in establishing new characters. But greatly disappoints as a send off for the old generation that fans have spent practically an entire life time looking up to these characters and adoring everything about them. ","true":true}
