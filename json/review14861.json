Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I honestly don't get all the hate this movie is getting from the so called \\\"fans\\\". In my opinion it's one of the best Star Wars movies yet. The story was genuinely new\\, and not the same old giant spherical weapon being destroyed like the last movie\\, the movie wasn't boringly predictable since the rebels didn't always miraculously succeed in their next to impossible missions and it showed that \\\"good\\\" and \\\"bad\\\" aren't as binary as we're led to think in the previous movies.\\n\\nThe only possible explanation for all this hate is that these fans just want the same old \\\"original\\\" trilogy filmed again and again. They don't want anything to change at all in this saga. And this\\, in my opinion\\, is the perfect way to make a story with such potential extremely boring.","true":true}
