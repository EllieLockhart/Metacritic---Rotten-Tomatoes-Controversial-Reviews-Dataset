Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it\\, I felt it was the first complete star wars film since Empire\\, I love that none of what folks assumed would happen occurs. I see a lot of complaints about Snoke\\, he had just as much backstory as Sidious\\, did if you cut out the prequels. I had an issue with one subplot\\, but I actually loved what they explored with this film.","true":true}
