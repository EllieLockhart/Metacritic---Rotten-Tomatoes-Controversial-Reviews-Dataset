Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Easily one of the best entries into the saga thus far\\, this film is a bold new direction for the new characters. Capitalizing on the strengths of 'The Force Awakens\\,' this film is filled stem to stern with an understanding of  the narrative power of the force. It's a film that I haven't stopped thinking about since my first viewing and that staying power is a testament to the work that Johson and crew have done.","true":true}
