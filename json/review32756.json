Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars the Last Jedi totally RAPES Star Wars fans because of that death in the ending. There are characters  who are wasted and killed off. It's a disappoint and subplots that don't need to be in the film. Besides that the movie was good.","true":true}
