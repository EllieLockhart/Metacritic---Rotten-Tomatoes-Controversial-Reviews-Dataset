Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am not a bot\\, I too created an account to add my voice of disgust.\\n\\nSome words\/phrases that come to mind every time I think of this movie:\\n- Garbage\\n- Dumpster fire\\n- WTF\\n- Horrendous\\n- Cringy\\n- Boring \\n- Dimwitted\\n- Shortsighted\\n- Socia justice propaganda\\n- Inconsistent\\n- Slow\\n- Disappointing\\n- Terrible\\n- Insulting\\n- Juvenile\\n- Plot holes\\n- #notmyluke\\n- #notmystarwars\\n- FLAT OUT BAD\\n\\nIt was a really rotten movie.
