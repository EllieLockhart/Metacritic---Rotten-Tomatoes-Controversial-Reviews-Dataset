Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The good: Adds a lot to cannon (as respectfully as one could)\\, twists the story of the saga in an interesting direction\\, has a number of memorable moments\\, continues the original trilogy tradition of making cinema references\\, and has meaningful nostalgic moments.\\n\\nThe bad: Too many awkward jokes\\, Finn's story line is superfluous\\, many characters have disappointing and confusing story lines (Rey\\, Kylo\\, Leia\\, Poe\\, and especially Snoke)\\, several elements from Ep. VIII seem disconnected from their implications in Ep. VII (Maz\\, rebel alliance\\, Snoke again).\\n\\nVerdict: Left entertained by the phenomenal cinematography and acting but disappointed by the story\\, writing\\, and direction.","true":true}
