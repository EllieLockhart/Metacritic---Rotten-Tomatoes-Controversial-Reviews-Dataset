Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sigh....\\n\\nFirst of all I want to thank all reviewers! Iv been reading all reviews since I first saw this movie (december\/17). It helped me digesting it.\\n\\nAlso I want to say it kinda 'scares' me that iv seen all these negative ratings for months and it still got an audience score of 48%. Like\\, really dark stuff\\, is disney really paying.....? Hard to believe but its strange the audience score drops 1% after 4 weeks of 1\/2 and 1 star ratings. \\n\\nI loved all star wars movie before this one\\, including the prequels\\, but this one is on another level or garbageness man.\\nIm not going to repeat its flaws. Everybody knows.\\n\\nFor the reviewers saying its so new\\, fresh\\, unpredictable\\, unexpecting :\\nplease gtfo. This movie is a BAD copy from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with a ten times less emotional pay off. Its nothing new. \\nPeople who are saying this probably never saw original SW trilogy.\\n\\n1 star\\, because im affraid 1\/2 stars don't count.","true":true}
