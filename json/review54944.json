Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's the familiar cinematic comfort food we're used to\\, and yet it's presented in a format that we aren't.\\n\\nPacing is an issue\\, even if it is in service of better developing the characters. There are a lot going on\\, but the plot never feels bloated\\, and the \\\"twists\\\" aren't so much about blowing the audience's minds but more about opening the audience's eyes to things that were always there.\\n\\nThe development of the characters is rich and immersive and unfolds in such a way that the franchise has never really tried before. For the first time leaving a 'Star Wars' film\\, I felt like I knew and cared about the characters beyond a superficial level.\\n\\nIt isn't perfect\\, but it's easily one of the best entries in the series.","true":true}
