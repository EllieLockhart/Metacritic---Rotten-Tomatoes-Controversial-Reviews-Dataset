Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie was beautiful in every aspect\\, the plot\\, the characters\\, the cinematography. The dynamic between our protagonists is a highlight of the film\\, and every single one of their interactions is electric. I would say that we spent a bit too much time with Oscar Isaac's character\\, considering the ammount of actions he took in the movie (not many)\\, which messed with the pacing a bit\\, but otherwise there are no complaints. The movie definitely exceeded expectations\\, and is a great addition to the Star Wars franchise.","true":true}
