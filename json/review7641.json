Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Everything that was done to the character of Luke Skywalker was an abomination.  Disney\\, JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson have ruined this franchise.  This is not a zero sum game.  You do not have to prop up weak characters by destroying the original heroes.  I was a fan since 1977.  This drivel that passes for a plot kills it for me.","true":true}
