Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I had read some of the criticisms of the movie before seeing it\\, I went in with an open mind and unfortunately\\, I felt the critics were right. There\u2019s a lot of cool stuff in the movie\\, some great parts\\, and nostalgia\\, but the storylines were waaaaay too much. The movie was too long\\, too complicated\\, too busy\\, and just didn\u2019t live up the the admittedly high expectations I had for it.","true":true}
