Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars movie made.It breaks my heart to see how Lukes character is destroyed. How Rey dont need practice in the Force to get powerful. Snokes story is untold. Kylo changes personality every scene. Its a discrace to all Star Wars fans. Read the Legacy of the force books for a good story for the same time period.","true":true}
