Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Absolutely\\, hands down the greatest star wars film ever made...I'm not being needlessly complimentary either\\, I was so disappointed by Force Awakens\\, which only had a few moments that were spectacular...this film\\, however\\, was one amazing sequence after the next; each one getting increasingly better! I am still overwhelmed by it.","true":true}
