Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think the reviews for this are stupid. People were complaining two years ago because TFA was to similar to New Hope\\, so RJ does something new and different and all people can do is hate. It's ridiculous. I for one really enjoyed this movie for how different and unexpected it was.","true":true}
