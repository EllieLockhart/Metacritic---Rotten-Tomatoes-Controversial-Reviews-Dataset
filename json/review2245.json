Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"At least\\, this was cheaper than going to the shrink. Why would a grown adult watch something like this? Its because we are useless. We are lazy\\, bored\\, and useless.. and no girlfriend. So\\, dont get your light sabers up. You\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)re fat\\, and belong on the couch. Don\u00ef\u00bf 1\/2(TM)t get up.","true":true}
