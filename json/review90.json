There are games out there that are fun but shallow. There are story driven games out there that are no fun at all. Very few games achieve having a remarkable story where you care about the characters and being super fun at the same time. The graphics may not be 4K but for that I watch a movie instead.

The graphics may not be 4K but for that I watch a movie instead. Yakuza 0 puts the fun back into video gaming. There is so much to do after you finish the main story. The voice acting is superb because the voice actors are real actors who have starred in Yakuza movies ! The music is catchy as anything; you know the memes. The mini games are fun and addictive and suck you in. Out Run anyone? Imaging taking Shenmue best pasrts and breeding it with the extracurricular activities of GTA V and inject some brawling fun from Streets of Rage. And did I mention the whole uncensored Japanese ecchi-ness? This is it. This is Yakuza 0. Do not think. Just play this game. Just do it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
