Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was a big disappointment and the worsts episode to date.\\nThe poor sets ( think fishing the penguin and the entry to the library\\, and the red backdrop)\\, were so poor\\, I felt I could comfortably reproduce these at home.\\nThe story was not PC but also not interesting.\\nI expect more and this one under delivered big time.","true":true}
