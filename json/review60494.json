So if the gameplay is not that amazing and fun that means the game is more about the story. Well the story was a nice idea but jumbled up and badly executed and dragged out which hurt the pacing a lot. It's cool that they have big characters as a gay couple that way Ellie had something to care for. But every character had some sort of a political view which was annoying. Basically rating it on the overall enjoyment i can't say i enjoyed it but there are moments that made the score a tad bit higher (flashbacks and such. And the Joel line where he says he'd do it all over again if he had the chance). I played part one for the first time just a few months before part 2 came out so I'm not angry because i didn't wait 7 years. If i were to rate the game on the first 10 hours i would've rated it a 6 but like 1-2h into Abby's part it became incredibly boring. I knew already that I'd find Owen and Mel dead and just to get to that point it took quite a bit of time. Abby's journey to find her friends dead is irrelevant only the outcome is important her part should've been like 3 hours long at most.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
