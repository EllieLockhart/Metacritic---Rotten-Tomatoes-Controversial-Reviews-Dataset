Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I personally enjoyed this movie. Was it what I was expecting.. No. but this doesn't make it bad movie. I enjoyed its twists and turns.. a few scenes felt slightly out of place. But overall I'm happy and will be seeing it a few more with popcorn in hand. I think its time that the star wars universe evolves a little.. I am excited to see what the future of star wars holds.","true":true}
