Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Poor\/NO follow up on plots left open from first movie. So many examples of no continuity from scene to scene. This movie is full PC and millennial crap. You may barf at how poor this movie depicts the legends we grew up with. Disney should take some time to come up with a story line that's actually good and somewhat original instead of going for the galaxys fastest money grab.","true":true}
