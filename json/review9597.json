Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good movie\\, a great reinvention of concepts as Force and others. A great performance by Mark Hamill\\, Carrie Fisher\\, Daisy Ridley\\, etc\\, and a beautiful story. Haters gonna hate\\, always\\, some people are no disposed to accept changes and are stuck in the past\\, the last jedi takes the star wars mythology to a new age with a deeper story.","true":true}
