The story sucks they made a character (abby) that killed the chracter you love (joel). Which is fine you can still play as Ellie but the thing is they tried to make you hate Ellie for some reason like having Ellie kill dogs showing flashbacks of Ellie being a dick to Joel. And whats worse is they forced you to play Abby the character you hate and forced you to like her. Like i dont a give a damn about her father and friends he killed joel. And another stupid thing is when Ellie is traumatized by killing a pregnant lady like she killed a lot of people before that but no killing pregnant ladies draws the line. The characters that are killed are forgettable like manny and jesie its like they died and nobody cared. They got a few screen time and then poof they out of the story. Like they forced this dumb ass storyline to our throats.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
