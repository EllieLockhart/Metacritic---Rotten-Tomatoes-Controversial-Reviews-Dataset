Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"They should not have invited Rian Johnson as a director and a writer. It's not somebody who understands Star Wars and he was not able to fulfill the task of creating a movie that would be appreciated by longtime fans for whom Star Wars takes roots in the episode IV-VI trilogy. I am glad J. J. Abrams returns in the episode IX\\, because he already managed to write and direct a movie that recreated the authentic atmosphere of the saga.","true":true}
