Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I feel that our understanding of the force is more developed\\, as well as the interesting relationship between Ben and Rey. (100% support Reylo btw) I agree with many other fans that it in part serves to transcend the old movies. Unlike TFA\\, TLJ actually gives us original material instead of simply nostalgia. It gives Star Wars the foot it needs to start something truly \\\"new\\\" and perhaps endure with fresh stories. Some loyal fans hated the movie\\, but I think that that is because it is no longer cut and dry-good and evil like the originals. In my opinion this gives them more depth\\, but change isn't always well received with fans...Also there is far more sarcastic humor in this movie than any of the others. I do think that in some areas the sarcasm was used a little too much. It took away from the gravity of the situation. But in the vast majority of instances the cleverness of dialogue and sarcastic banter was fantastic. The flow of the movie was at times a little disjunct in my opinion\\, but I still loved it. I love the new characters. I love the fight scenes. I just loved it period. \\nPrepare to have your mind blown. So all in all I really should be giving this movie a 4 and a 1\/2\\, but I'm giving it a 5 to combat all the prejudiced 1 star-ers. lol.","true":true}
