Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS \\n\\nPeople really need to wake up... This was by no means a perfect film or not the film many of us expected but for the most part\\, that is due to the ridiculous expectations we had built up in our own head. Those who claim that this is as bad or worse than the prequels seriously need a reality check however\\, as do the people that this different type of Luke has ruined their childhood. What did you expect? You knew that this was how Luke was going to be from the trailers and multiple statements from Mark Hamill himself. Any other version (a version in which he simply causes havoc) would have undermined the new characters in the trilogy and made the story all about him again which again\\, as stated by Hamill himself\\, is no longer the case. Had Yoda gone with Luke in ESB\\, the story would become less about him and the test of character he had to face ALONE which in turn shaped Luke and the rest of the OT. The same applies to Rey here\\, who has to go alone and face Snoke and try and save Kylo alone because otherwise there would have too much focus on Luke and Rey would have no doubt been sideined for the rest of the film. This is her and Kylo's story\\, you already have Luke's. \\n\\nLuke is not even that much out of character and hear me out on this one...He made an impulsive decision when he thought about killing Kylo. How many times had he been impulsive before? Leaving Yoda immediately to fight Vader is just one example. To say that Luke has no dark within him is just wrong and him being tempted to kill Kylo after seeing how much destruction Vader caused was not an out of character decision. People are forgetting that within seconds he had changed his mind and felt such an immense guilt that he left before he hurt anybody else he cared about. Again\\, selfless Luke.\\n\\nAs for the rest of the story\\, there was certainly some weaker points. Whilst Finn was enjoyable and Rose a great addition\\, their story did feel streched out to fill the 2hr30 film and overall had no real effect on the rest of the story other than serving the characters arc\\, which can be forgiven.\\n\\nI also would have liked to see Rey receive more training by spending at least a month on the island with Luke. We do not know how long she spends there but I can't imagine it was longer than a week. However\\, the story was moving at a fast pace and one month of a connection between Rey and Kylo would not have worked as well as it did in the film. This new addition to one's force ability was a personal highlight of the film\\, with every \\\"force skype\\\" scene between Rey and Kylo captivating me every time. There is no doubt Rian Johnson had to explore the clear chemistry between the two\\, with Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver putting in immense performances. \\n\\nI would love to cover more points but so much happens in this film\\, leaving you wondering what the hell just happened. \\n\\nThe crazy part is\\, nothing has really changed by the end of the movie but at the same time\\, everything has changed; Rey is still light and discovers\\, in reality\\, nothing she didn't already know about her parents but at the same time\\, she is set on the path to become a Jedi and a key part of the resistance. The same can be said for Kylo. He is still conflicted yet still angry and still delving further into the dark side. I do hope JJ is able to conclude this trilogy in a natural way given that this felt like a conclusion in itself by the end. I definitely would like to see a time jump by the next film\\, allowing Kylo to have become much more powerful with the dark side and likewise with Rey and the lightside.","true":true}
