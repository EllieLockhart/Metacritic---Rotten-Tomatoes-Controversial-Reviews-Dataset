Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you just casually watched a few \\\"Star Wars\\\" movies & thought they were alright\\, this is for you. If you are a \\\"Star Wars\\\"-fan you can't take this new installment seriously; to a point where you actually feel a bit of shallow pain after leaving the theater. The movie feels like fanfiction\\, which threw all the rules\\, that George Lucas created\\, out of the window und made your childhood characters fly through space like marvel space-wizards. Star Wars always felt like a real thing far far away\\, now it feels like a summer blockbuster movie\\, that you'll forget the second you come home. There are so many things that are bad about this movie\\, that i couldn't get them into the review. I'm not a Review guy\\, but now I felt a strong sense do get my disappointment out of my system.
