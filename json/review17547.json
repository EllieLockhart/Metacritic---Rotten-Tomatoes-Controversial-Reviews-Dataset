Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I signed up on Rotten Tomatoes (this is my first review) just to rate this movie. ...DISNEY LISTEN....\\nThis was my least fav Star Wars movie of all. Cheesy comedy (Luke brushing off his shoulder\\, or tossing his LightsaberPoe on 'hold' ????) CHEESY COMEDY. \\nBut the worst part was... where was the story on things that left us wondering for 2years since the Force Awakens? (That movie was 9\/10 btw) \\nWho was Snoke? No background? What was Maz story\\, why did she have the light saber? \\nThe interaction between Luke and Rei was so rushed on Jedi island. I didn't like all the creatures \/ caretakers on the island (or the Jar Jar Binks stupidness of the furball \\ncharachter on the Falcon with Chewie. I was completely let down by this movie. Also\\, Kylo Ren was an awesome villian introduced in Force Awakens. Now you strip him of his mask and a 10\/10 Villian because a boy next door 1\/10 villian. We need more story in Ep 9.","true":true}
