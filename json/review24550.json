Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Movie definitely seemed more of a cash grab or film piece to win critics over.  Any fan of star wars films will find it doesn't flow with the others.  It takes established characters off into directions they would never realistically go on if you have seen their personalities in other films.","true":true}
