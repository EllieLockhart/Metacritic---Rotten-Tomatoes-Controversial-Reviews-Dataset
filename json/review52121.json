Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After Star Wars VII\\, which was controversal to say the least\\, Disney made a real Disney Movie. \\nWeak Story\\, little to zero character development\\, plot holes in dozens and an unmotivated Luke Skywalker. \\nI love the Star Wars franchise since the first movie but the new movies...just dont feel like Star Wars anymore.","true":true}
