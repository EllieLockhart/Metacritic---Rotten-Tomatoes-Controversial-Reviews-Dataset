Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Like attending a timeshare presentation\\, I was all pumped up during the movie\\, but my buyers remorse kicked in as I started to reflect on what I just watched.  And I felt I had just been ripped off by a flashy swindler.  Sloppy and lazy storytelling.  The surprises were only letdowns.  Killing off main characters for convenience.  The flaws are too numerous to mention\\, but I would have forgiven them if only they had treated Luke appropriately. But that was just too much and this series is now damaged goods.  Could have been one of the coolest movies ever!!! But they blew it\\, big time. On a side note\\, it makes me appreciate the others more (especially Empire) because those movies really were magic\\, they were carefully constructed\\, and most importantly they had heart.  I guess it was too much to think it could come around again.  Cheers!","true":true}
