Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie hurt me on a very personal level\\, what it has done to the Star Wars mythos and arguably the most beloved Star Wars character of all time\\, Luke Skywalker\\, is unforgivable. Riddled with plot holes and questionable plot line choices that make little to no sense. I only give this movie a half star because it is pretty to look at. Pretty movie\\, horrible Star Wars movie.","true":true}
