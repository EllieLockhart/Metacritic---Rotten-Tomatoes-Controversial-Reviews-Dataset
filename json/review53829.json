Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Having those little comedic moments in starwars isn't new. In the past they've been used at the right time in the right moments and with the right characters. In this steaming pile of shit of a movie they just keep coming\\, non-stop. Overwhelming in fact. \\nNothing really happens for the first hour or so of the movie. \\nAnnoying animal aliens come back stronger than ever.\\nThe animals seem to be able to identify who the good guys are and can perceive incomprehensible dangers to them.\\nThey ruined snoke completely.\\nThe first orders tactics are at their worst. How is it the officers in command are so incompetent?\\nThere are far worse sins for this movie but I don't want to spoil the main parts of the movie. Not that they add any actual depth to the story or anything though. There's just a few stupid surprises in there which mean absolutely nothing at the end of the day.","true":true}
