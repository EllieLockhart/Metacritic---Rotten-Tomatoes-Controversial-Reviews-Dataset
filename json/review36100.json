Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi was a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe. It's even better the second time. Rian Johnson took risks that pay off. As a fanboy I would say that it is not what I was expecting or hoping for\\, but that's ok. So many movies are predictable\\, Rian Johnson gave us a Star Wars movie that is willing to burn down what we know and (attempt to) open our minds to the vast possibilities of the force and the Star Wars universe (obviously there are those who can't see past their fan theories and expectations).\\n\\nOpinions on this movie vary greatly\\, but there's no way this movie deserves a 1\/2 a star like so many have. Those scores are from angry fans who gave The Force Awakens 5 stars for not taking any risks at all and following a scene by scene formula provided in the original trilogy. This isn't a remake like its predecessor\\, it pays homage to the classics while shaking things up to the vast potential directions that Star Wars can take.\\n\\nI can't wait to see how JJ brings this trilogy to a close in Episode IX as well as to see what Rian Johnson has in store for us with the next non-Skywalker trilogy.","true":true}
