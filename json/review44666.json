Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Total nihilistic in it's storytelling. No regard to past established canon and no progression of the plots established in Force Awakens. There's nothing more to explore that fascinates me as a Star Wars fan.\\n\\nIt's stunning to look at\\, but that's expected. \\nSo\\, maybe make it 420p next time to subvert our expectations.","true":true}
