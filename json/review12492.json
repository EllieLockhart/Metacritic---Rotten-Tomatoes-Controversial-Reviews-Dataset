Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can only imagine the negative reviews are politically motivated. \\n\\nThis is a very good and entertaining movie. Hamill is great as are the rest of the cast except perhaps Driver\\, but all things of opinion are a matter of taste. \\n\\nThe story is solid and kept me engaged throughout. \\n\\nI will see it again while it is in theaters\\, and I have to drive close to 60 miles to do so.","true":true}
