Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"You know\\, the textures\\, lights and all this stuff looks great\r\rBUT\r\rThe first part of this game became so loved\\, famous and popular because it has an unique atmosphere - it was a story about 2 persons\\, about their relationships. At first they weren't even talking to each other and at the end they showed everybody\\, that they were ready to kill everybody to save each other. They were like a father and a daughter. They are arguing\\, they are joking with each other\\, but they are always together. But naughty dog literally smashed this concept with a golf stick. I won't talk about SJW \\, its acceptable (but it shows us that our dog has no balls). I just want you to know\\, that Ellie's flashbacks are better then entire game.\rYou were able to create a great game\\, just like the first part - modern\\, interesting and having a cool setting... And you know\\, you had done it\\, congrats! But you spoiled it with such stupid storyline. You didn't kill Joel\\, you killed atmosphere\\, concept and your own ratings.\r\rI am ready to wait 7  years again\\, but I really want you to create the game\\, that's better then the first part.\r\rI want Last Of Us to be a great story about father\\,daughter and a huge cruel world\\, not about angry lesbians.\r\rR.I.P. Joel Miller - he was literally half of the game.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
