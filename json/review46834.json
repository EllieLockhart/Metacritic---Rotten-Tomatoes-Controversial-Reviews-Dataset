Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Well\\, that happened. Just\\, wow! I was on the edge of my seat. My stomach hurt because I was nervous for FICTIONAL characters! At the time I'm rating this the audience score is low. That makes me upset. \\nI hope it changes. A must see for any Star Wars fan.","true":true}
