Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I loved it. The storyline was amazing and defied all expectations. It was very human. I don't understand why so many people hated it. The characters were so fleshed out and complex. The story was never dull for a moment and so many incredible things happened. Just go watch it.","true":true}
