Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After sitting with this movie for a while\\, its bad. What did Disney do to my childhood heroes!? Disney had access to all the Star Wars Books. All they had to do was follow them. Instead\\, they wanted to be different. I won't even see Episode 9 whenever it comes out.","true":true}
