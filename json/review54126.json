Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I don\u2019t understand why other fans didn\u2019t like this movie very much. I thought it was great. The only reason why I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is because they left too many unanswered questions. The plot was not as strong as Episode 7. I thought Luke could have been utilized better. I think Disney is trying to be too \u201cpolitically correct\u201d by hinting at the idea that you can be a nobody and still be amazingly force-sensitive\\, and that it doesn\u2019t have to be inherited. The old \u201cwhen you wish upon a star\\, you\u2019re dreams come true\u201d routine. Aside from that obvious theme\\, I think the acting was well done\\, the special effects were awesome\\, and the interesting link between Rey and Kylo-Ren is worth exploring in a sequel. My suggestion is to ignore critics and love this new chapter of Star Wars despite a few holes.","true":true}
