Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is terrific family fun like any Star Wars film should be. It's a great addition to the saga\\, and plays very well in terms of tone\\, humor\\, and action right after Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. It left me wondering where this saga will go next. All of the haters need to reexamine what made the original trilogy great\\, because Disney film or not\\, this new movie managed to capture it all\\, and play out a new important chapter following The Force Awakens.","true":true}
