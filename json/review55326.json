Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Listen\\, this movie was only alright. I appreciate the movie for what it was. Rian Johnson did a great job with the visuals\\, there were moments where the I audibly gasped at how gorgeous the scenes were. However\\, that Leia scene in space was literally horrible. It broke the flow of the scene and felt clunky in execution. The story was lacking and it made it hard for me to care about the characters. The Finn\/Rose subplot could have been great but was squandered at the end. The only good story point is the breakdown of Luke as a hero and the complexity that showed. All in all Rian Johnson did an alright job. JJ Abrams should have stayed on as director and had Rian Johnson as a part of the visual team. ","true":true}
