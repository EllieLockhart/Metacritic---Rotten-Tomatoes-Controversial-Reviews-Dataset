Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"My father a (\\\"pastie\\\" as this movie puts it) white male Received the Metal of Honor for his service in WW ll fighting\\, and yes killing Nazi's. If you are of White European decent and enjoy being portrayed as a Nazi\\, you will love this movie. Oh and if you ever wanted to see Princess Leia fly thru outer space... you will think this is brilliant!  All I can figure is Writer and director Rian Johnson must have had his hands too full molesting perspective cast members to actually make a real movie. Save your money\\, This isn't even worth picking up at a garage sale.","true":true}
