Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"TLOU2 is the story of two women that take the same path to avenge their \\\"father\\\" learning along the way that the cost of said path is huge\\, and in which they both end up losing themselves. The narrative is great. In a world like this you dont get to go out as a hero. The complexity of the characters is outstanding and they probably are the most human characters we have ever seen in a game and that is exactly why during this stroy they make mistakes and sometimes they give in to the anger\\, they act driven by their emotions\\, thats not something you see a lot these days in videogames. I think Naughty Dog took a lot of risks and definetly didnt go for the easy way (fan service) and in my opinion that payed off. The second half of the story works perfectly as a way to show the player that in this story there are two point of views and they both are doing what they think is the correct thing to do\\, and its completely justified. This is a story about how the lives of two girls merge when they go down this spiral of anger and violence after someone took one of the most important things in their lives. This is honestly the best game i've played in a long long time\\, and i think its even better than the first installment of the franchise. I understand why some people are upset about what happens in this game\\, but in a **** up world like this one thats how life is. People need to understand that they are not writing a story\\, they are being told one\\, and they can't control what happens. Definetly a 10\/10 for me.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
