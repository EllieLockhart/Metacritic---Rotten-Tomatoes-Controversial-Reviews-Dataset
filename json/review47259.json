Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a sensational\\, sophisticated\\, and satisfying blockbuster! Star Wars: The Last Jedi reminded me why I loved Star Wars to begin with and knocked me out of my Star Wars apathy that I'd been experiencing for over a year. Rian Johnson clearly understands The Force better than any other filmmaker who has ever touched this franchise\\, and the story presents a compelling deconstructionist tale of deification\\, legacy\\, failure\\, and redemption all under a smart meta-narrative which weaves its many subplots into a whole.","true":true}
