Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"this movie sucks.\\n\\nThe purpose of these films\\, the force awakens and the last jedi now were to kill off your childhood heroes. and in that regard i guess they were a success. carrie fisher looked as though she had alzheimers and had wandered onto the set and read a few lines. sad.\\n\\nand poor luke ugh. disgusted\\, i am.\\n\\na real shame as rogue one was a pretty good movie so i was hoping they would come through and redeem themselves with this one\\, but nope. pure garbage.","true":true}
