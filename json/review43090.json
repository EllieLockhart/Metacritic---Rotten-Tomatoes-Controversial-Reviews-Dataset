Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie would be good if it wasn't a Star Wars movie. There are a lot of small things that hurt this film but\\, as a Star Wars fan\\, I was willing to forgive them if Rian Johnson gave me what I wanted. Having the real Luke Skywalker in a film rather than a whiny curmudgeon would've forgiven everything. Instead he has now selfishly removed a quintessential character in a way that does him no injustice.","true":true}
