Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"JJ Abrams had set up an easy slam dunk for this film\\, and Disney completely blew it.\\nThe Last Jedi is full of plot holes\\, under developed characters\\, and had far too much humour with terrible timing.  Overall it was the worst depiction and worst sort of betrayal to one of the most beloved and developed characters in the franchise - Luke.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi completely failed to build or develop on the excellent movie The Force Awakens.  How a big-budget film such as this could be made so poorly is way beyond me\\, especially after the success of The Force Awakens and Rogue One.","true":true}
