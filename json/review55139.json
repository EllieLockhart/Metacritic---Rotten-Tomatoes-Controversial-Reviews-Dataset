Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so looking forward to this. I am a child of the 70's\/80's and Star Wars has been a big part of my life for most of it. I largely tolerated the prequels; I was after all in my 20's and 30's when they came out. Episode 7 was to me quite\\, well. I was intrigued and I was looking forward to the way forward. I felt some things was worrying\\, and Han Solo dying I assumed was Harrison Ford's demand. I liked the look of it\\, even though it felt like J J's Star Trek at times. But this new movie I just detest. I won't say I wasn't exited by parts of it\\, visually I thought things were quite astounding at times\\, but\\, no\\, everything is half arsed\\, the characters are written to fall in place with agendas\\, the casino thing was just terrible. Nothing it seems from the previous movie seemed important to the writer of this movie. Set-ups were either ignored\\, ridiculed or treated as an inside joke. Any reasons as to why things have gone to hell since Return of the Jedi is sidestepped by these movies. The new characters have their potential back-story rubbed out before our eyes\\, and then\\, as if the writers hate us\\, the fans of the first movies are treated with scorn\\, disdain and I would almost say hatred. \\\"So you watched movies in the 70's and 80's did you? Well\\, we-don't-care!\\\" Luke Skywalker's treatment by these people is for lack of a better work\\, sickening. Just like Terminator 3 made the efforts of everyone in Terminator 2 wasted\\, The Last Jedi reduces Luke in the eyes of everyone to something of a joke\\, a complete loser who might as well have turned to the dark side\\, at least he would have been interesting\\, instead of a sulking loner and potential child murderer.\\n\\nI did not want to be \\\"that guy\\\" who weeps over lost youth or whatever\\, and I don't think I am\\, I think I am a man who weeps over the ruins of cultural vandalism.","true":true}
