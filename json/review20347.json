Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It was wonderful!  I found myself getting chills...yes..chills at several scenes. Long\\, Long ago in a time far away was the last time I got chills at a Star Wars flick. Clever plotting and endearing characters make this a win. See it soon\\, and in the best theater you can.","true":true}
