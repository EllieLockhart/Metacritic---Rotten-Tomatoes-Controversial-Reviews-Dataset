Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Utter waste of the Luke Skywalker character. Why bring him back and do nothing but p#*& off anyone who loved the old trilogy. And the main Villain is pathetic. Not sure who they are trying to sell this too but i am now totally impartial to episode 9.... ill catch it on Netfix if at all.\\nDoes any fan out there actually like The Last Jedi?\\nAre we all too attached to Luke Skywalker and blinded to the new story???\\nWhy couldn't you let Luke kick some ass and then die heroically?","true":true}
