Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Welp\\, if Force Awakens and Rogue One were more like well crafted nostalgia tributes\\, and the prequels were just\\, bleh\\, The Last Jedi is the best\\, most inventive and interesting Star Wars movie since Empire Strikes Back.\\n\\nIt revives a sense of wonder and originality to the films that are lost under the three decades of pop culture phenomena\\, and the tropes and formulas that came with it.","true":true}
