Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i wanted to like this movie sooo much... but there are SO MANY PLOT HOLES... uugghh... and the worst part is they RUINED LUKE SKYWALKER... he would have never given up hope on Kylo... this movie is a mess... i enjoyed some parts... but this is NOT STAR WARS... but it's canon now... and it RUINED STAR WARS... it snuffed out one of the best parts of my childhood... it sucks... i was looking forward to more Star Wars but now i could care less about episode 9... Disney lost the Star Wars soul... have fun selling porgs and resistance decoder rings... i'm out. :(","true":true}
