Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Wow... just wow. I don't understand how this could happen... good SW writers exist in the world\\, where were they?? Why didn't Disney hire them? \\nThis movie was hot garbage and the trilogy is quite obviously being made up ad it goes along... don't watch\\, and please strike this from cannon and start again.","true":true}
