Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One off the most disappointing films i've ever seen\\, everything from gaping plot holes (made by hyperspace kamikaze attacks) to some off the most boring characters i've ever seen. Dont even get me started on the uninspired alien designs\\, what happened to the Star Wars galaxy filled with interesting planets and species? Its just humans and one shot background aliens. \\nI could probably go on for hours on everything wrong with this sorry excuse off a Star Wars movie\\, but I would just say that the character assassination off Luke is enough to be said.","true":true}
