Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"New Director\\, slightly new direction. New take on how the Force really works. Worth seeing for visual effects\\, but be prepared to see some long established tropes turned on their head.","true":true}
