Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"i gave this movie 1 star for it's outstanding cinematography\\, acting\\, and special effects.  Everything else i give the middle finger just like Disney gave to me.  don't let anyone fool you.  it's not bad only because it's not what people expected but there are major missteps in logic\\, story\\, and character motives.  i have yet to see these things addressed in the movie. i am a huge star wars fan but i believe non fans are going to be bored stiff in the middle of the movie due to it's pacing issues.  This is why you're moviie is losing traction because at VERY best people are leaving the theater thinking this movie was \\\"meh\\\" at best.","true":true}
