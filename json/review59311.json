Enemy AI is among the best I've seen and you can adjust the Difficulty\rto a degree that is way beyond you find in any game these days.\rCombat is hard and that's the way it should be. You're not happy ? Go play Ghosts Of Tsushima which has the dumbest AI you can find.\rThe atmosphere and immersion are also top notch.\rThere is no filler stuff here\\, if you want that\\, again\\, go play Ghosts Of Tsushima.\rGraphics and visuals are up there with the best. Even better than Days Gone.\rIt's hard to believe this is possible with just an APU.\rAll in all\\, a great game that you'll remember for a long time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
