Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A total disgrace to everything Star Wars. I thought Force Awakens was bad\\, but this made it all so much worse. I'm out for episode 9\\, it's a drop in the ocean\\, but it at least makes me feel better to know I won't be giving Disney more of my money.","true":true}
