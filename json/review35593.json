Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi is a film with a heart of gold and presents its audience with hope in the face of the various failures its characters face. Its beautifully shot and the dynamic between Daisy Ridley's Rey and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is mesmerising. And this Star Wars film has perhaps the best space battles I have seen so far from this franchise\\, as well as a truly unique lightsaber battle.","true":true}
