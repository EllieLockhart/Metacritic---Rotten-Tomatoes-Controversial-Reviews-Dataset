Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I can't understand how anyone can give this movie 5 stars. The whole movie was just eye candy while flat out telling it's audience to forget about the past Star Wars movies. The past Star Wars movies are the reason people see the current Star Wars movies\\, and Disney just let all hardcore fans down. This movie was nothing but childish humor\\, little to no character development\\, with too many plotholes and writer's conveniences. They then either refuse to answer questions from previous movies or give the most uncreative answers ever. And what they did with the Luke character is beyond dumb. It's almost as if Disney is daring you hate this movie.","true":true}
