Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I love the original trilogy\\, particularly tESB. I didn't like the prequels\\, but enjoyed some of the action and set pieces. I thought Force Awakens was a wild and fun ride with many imperfections I could overlook. The Last Jedi was 2..5 hours of \\\"meh\\\". It has a handful of good performances and cool characters\\, but the story goes nowhere and is not very engaging. I'd recommend seeing it at a cheap afternoon matinee or wait for streaming. Hopefully\\, episode IX will be an improvement.","true":true}
