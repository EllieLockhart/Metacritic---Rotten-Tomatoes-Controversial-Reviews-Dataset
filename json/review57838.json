Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Way to go. They destroy everything that was beloved about the most successful film franchise ever. They even flushed everything that was good about the JJ film down the toilet. Apparently none of it mattered!  Im so sick of politics in real life and now we have to have it shoved down our f-ing throats by politically rabid producers\\, writers and directors.  I hate them for what they have done. I hate the gender quotas\\, race quotas and the neutering of ALL the masculinity of these characters.  Hollywood deserves everything that is happening to it.","true":true}
