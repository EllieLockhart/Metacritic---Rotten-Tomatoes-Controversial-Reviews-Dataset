Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Last Jedi may be my favorite Star Wars Movie since the original Trilogy. I like how it brings back that wonder and religious undertone that make this so different to other Sci-Fi. There may be some scenes that were not too memorable\\, but the whole \\\"spark of resistance\\\" is shown beautifully. Love the epic end they gave Luke\\, love the kids on the casino planet. Benicio Del Toro was a bit of a forced character but I appreciate the way they detach the mystery of the force from politics with the small weapons-trader-subplot.\\n\\nAll in all a movie I could watch over and over again. The stunning music by John Williams helps. Just as much as the great visuals\\, on the salt planet for example or the space battles. Oh and surprisingly often I had to laugh. Refreshingly. I always thought Star Wars should be a fun fairy tale in space and not another dark\\, brooding downer.","true":true}
