Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a great\\, but not perfect addition to the series. The plot was interesting and original with character development that fleshes out the newer characters that were introduced in The Force Awakens. It also answers some big questions and addresses some new topics in the Star Wars world. Visually\\, the movie is gorgeous\\, with a lot of interesting views to take in. The soundtrack is also wonderful with familiar Star Wars styling and motifs. The only thing to question about the movie is the addition Marvel-like humor and the longer running time\\, but for some people those will either be positives or neutrals. While some fans bemoan the new Star Wars landscape and where the new story is headed\\, that's a matter of opinion (And opinions are still very split). Overall\\, the movie offers a lot of entertainment and was well-made. I highly recommend it.","true":true}
