Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible\\, terrible entry into the Star Wars universe. The plot is propelled by one contrivance and implausibility after another... from the idea that starships would engage in a 20 hour slow-mo chase\\, to the idea that characters can survive the vacuum of space\\, the list goes on and on. Both Leia and Luke's last scenes in a Star Wars film feel wasted here\\, and there's not much emotional heft until the very end. Finn's plot line is one big red herring. Rian Johnson\\, you should be ashamed","true":true}
