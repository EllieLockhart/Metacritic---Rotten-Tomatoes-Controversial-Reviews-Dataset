Honestly up until I was forced to try to kill Ellie while playing as Abby I was completely on board with the plot. In a universe where it's impossible to define good\/evil characters as it's a morally grey universe it's clear they tried to show Abby as a hero and Ellie as a villain because she held onto her grief and expected us to forget how Abby brutally tortured and murdered Joel like that. There is a clear plot hole from the first game where Marlene reveals they have experimented on other immune patients and all died without creating a vaccine this totally could have been a possibility for Ellie. It took a while for me to warm up to playing as Abby but by the end of Seattle day 2 I grew to like her \\, however I feel betrayed that we were advertised a different game. As we play through half the game as Abby it is ridiculous we weren't told that this would happen it caught a lot of people of guard and put them off .Lastly we should have been given a choice as to if we wanted to give up Dina and JJ and go after Abby (and kill her )  or to stay with Dina and try to work through Ellie's trauma with her help.  I understand the message was revenge is not the right thing to do but it was conveyed in the worst way.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
