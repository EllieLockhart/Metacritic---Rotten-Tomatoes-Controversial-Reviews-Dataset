Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Unique\\, Flawed\\, But needed.\\nThese three terms describe all my feelings towards The Last Jedi\\, I personally loved the movie and would recommend anyone to see it\\, I can see however all the criticism it is getting\\, but people have to understand that the movie is supposed to show failure\\, conflict and consequence\\, most fans are too narrow minded to see these themes sadly\\, I hope the storm subsides and people can see the movie for what is is.","true":true}
