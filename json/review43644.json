Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was overall a terrible movie. At best it was visually cool to see some of the Star Wars ships in action\\, but despite my love for all things Star Wars this film left me feeling hollow. I truly believe Rian Johnson had never watched any other Star Wars film before writing this Disney trash. There was no hero. There was no villain. Everything we wanted was ignored and everything we didn't need was not even shoved in our faces it was just tossed onto the table like a conglomerate of days old leftovers.","true":true}
