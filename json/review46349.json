Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Was looking forward to this movie after really enjoying The Force Awakens. Unfortunately this movie did not live up to expectations. Although it is an enjoyable movie\\, it doesn\u2019t feel like a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie in the vein of the original trilogy. The awkward attempts at humor\\, especially in the first scene with Luke didn\u2019t sit well. There were some non-sensical plot elements if you take the time to analyze them\\, but most movie goers probably just enjoy the ride. My biggest point of contention was the treatment of Luke. It just didn\u2019t seem to be a fitting end for his story ark. I understand part of the theme of this movie is \u201cforgetting the past\u201d so Disney can be free to write new paths forward\\, but Luke deserved a better ending. ","true":true}
