Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Tremendously disappointed.  I understand the motivation to move past the original trilogy\\, but what is left is empty and superficial.  I really enjoy John Boyega as an actor\\, but Finn's storyline was a complete waste of screen time.  1\/3 of the plot dedicated to themes of income inequality isn't what I'm interested in for an SW film.","true":true}
