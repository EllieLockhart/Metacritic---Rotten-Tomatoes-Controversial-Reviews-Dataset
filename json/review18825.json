Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"It's a mess\\, sexist and looks like it is produced by people who haven't seen any of the star wars movies.  I have lost all hope for the future films\\, Disney most have paid off a lot of film critics.","true":true}
