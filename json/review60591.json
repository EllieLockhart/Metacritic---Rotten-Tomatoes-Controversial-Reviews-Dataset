Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"*SPOILERS*\r\rI know a lot of people have problems with this game but for me and a lot of other people this game was amazing\\, story and all. I loved Abby and all the new characters except for Owen he felt weird. Joel's death was brutal and done really early and of course his death could have been done in a better way but for me it was realistic and made me want to kill Abby. And after seeing Abby's story it made me feel bad for her and i ended up loving her character and Laura Bailey really helped. Now I love Joel's character but i hope people realize he was a piece of **** and everything he did in the first game was selfish because he wanted a his daughter back and kill dozens of people who were trying to find the cure just because he couldn't let Ellie go. Now like Tommy said i cant say i would have done any different but that doesnt make Joel a saint and i think that Abby had a very good reason to do what she did and knowing that i wasnt as mad about how Joel died once i beat the game and reflecting on it\\, it was a very **** good game. The only reason its not a 10\/10 for me is because of some bugs that are noticeable but not super game breaking for me at least and some of the writing was a little weird like when Abby said \\\"You are my family\\\" to Lev\\, I thought that was a little off and also the Abby sex scene felt out of nowhere and a little unnecessary and was just there to add drama. But everything else was heartbreaking and emotional in the best way possible and Im looking forward to a third one.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
