Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don\u2019t listen to other users. This is a must see film. It rivals empire strikes back as the best Star Wars film. Direction was great\\, Oscar worthy cinematography\\, Mark Hamill\u2019s best performance\\, and above all\\, it was new and different for Star Wars\\, delivering twists I genuinely did not expect. Every actor or actress did a fantastic job\\, with good chemistry between all of the performers. The score is also as great with John Williams\\, and the director clearly had such an eye for detail that made it really clear he was passionate about the project. Overall Star Wars the last Jedi was my favorite film all year. And easily the best of the new Star Wars films\\, if not the best period.","true":true}
