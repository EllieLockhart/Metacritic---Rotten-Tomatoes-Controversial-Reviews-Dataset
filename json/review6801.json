Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't understand all the bad reviews. This movie wasn't perfect and it wasn't as good as rouge one\\, but people saying it's worse than episodes 1 and 2 shock me. It is different from your normal Star Wars movie\\, but that's why I certainly love it and some people hate it. People hated 7 for its unoriginal plot line and now people hate this for being too original. Make up your mind people!","true":true}
