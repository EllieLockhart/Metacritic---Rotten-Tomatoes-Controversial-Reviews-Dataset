Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Visually nice\\, but several characters were empty and not needed for the story's main story arc; including\\, disappointingly\\, Finn's. Got the impression this movie was aimed in trying to makeup for the countless movies that came before that involved strong male\/weak female characters. Portray of Luke Skywalker was a farce\\, going against Star Wars canon. Yet another greedy and integrity-challenged modern Disney film.","true":true}
