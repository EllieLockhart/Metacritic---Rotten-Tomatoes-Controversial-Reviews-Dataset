Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I am a huge Star Wars fan and have been for decades.  Got thousands of dollars worth of the toys and related merchandise sitting here in my gameroom\/office with me.  And as much as I wanted this movie to be good\\, it just isn't. It's really quite terrible.  It makes me sad.  I don't care about any of the characters in it\\, the acting is atrocious and awkward\\, the plot is nonsense\\, it's full of plot holes\\, the pacing is terrible\\, there is too much new-agey liberal crap\\, etc etc.  I just can't deal with this.  All I can hope for at this point is that I live long enough to see a complete Star Wars reboot.","true":true}
