Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I really enjoyed this movie\\, if only just to see my dark force honey Kylo Ren.  His character growth alone is enough to keep me coming back for more.  If you enjoyed The Force Awakens you will probably like this movie.  We're not talking about Citizen Kane.  We're talking about a universe where certain people can move objects with their mind.  And one of those people is the beautifully tortured Ren!","true":true}
