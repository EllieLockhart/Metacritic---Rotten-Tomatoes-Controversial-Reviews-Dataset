Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is a fantastic movie.....mostly.\\nThey handled a lot of the stuff PERFECTLY - especially all the stuff that people have been obsessively making stupid theories about.\\nAnd there are PLENTY of HOLY SHIT amazing moments.\\n\\nBut it's not perfect. \\n\\n++VAGUE SPOILERS++\\n\\nThere's a whole side quest that's kind of...not great\\, and feels really unnecessary.\\n\\nPorgs are cool\\, but I think they fulfilled the movie's allowance for CGI critters. The movie went a LITTLE too far beyond that.\\n\\nThe new \\\"main character\\\" doesn't feel like she needs to exist\\, but she WOULD HAVE if she had just been given the skills of the guy who they go on the side quest to find. \\n\\nAnd more than anything else\\, the pacing of the movie is kinda weird.
