Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Lots of other folks have already shed light on how poor this movie is from a plot and storytelling perspective. If this wasn't a Star Wars movie with the backing of billions of dollars and fan nostalgia\\, this movie would have been gone from theaters in a weekend. It's pretty sad to see the disparity between critic and fan reviews and does lend evidence to support a conspiracy theory of huge payoffs by Disney to hide the fact that this movie is a turd. \\n\\nAnd it's also a shame because there were so many compelling things to explore that this movie either mishandles or ignores. Rey gets barely any screen time and her character doesn't evolve. Kylo Ren descends further into a one dimensional tantrum throwing adolescent. And Luke Skywalker turns into a pissy old man who seems to have not gained any wisdom from his previous experiences. I could go on about how this film does a disservice to its characters and fans\\, but ultimately this lazy excuse of a film isn't worth more than the 3 hours you'll spend watching the Star Wars universe unravel while Disney reels in the $$$$.","true":true}
