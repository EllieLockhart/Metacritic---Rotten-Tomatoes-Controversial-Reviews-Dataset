Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"One of the most disappointing viewing experiences of my life.  Similar to seeing Attack of the Clones and slowly realizing that yup\\, Star Wars is bad.  How on earth did they mess up Star Wars this badly after the prequels?  Its just mesmerizing that they could release this into theaters.","true":true}
