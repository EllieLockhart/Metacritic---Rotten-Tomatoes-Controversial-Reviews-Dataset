Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The animators did an excellent job with the CGI space scenes\\, but the story is very lacking. The Force Awakens setup a lot of good potential future stories. Don't expect to see any of those plot points expanded upon in this movie. You could tell the writer of this movie isn't a fan of the franchise and doesn't understand the universe and characterizations of the old characters.","true":true}
