Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"can't tell if I was watching space balls 2 or a start war. with so many forced jokes it's hard to tell the difference. if anyone was to make a parody of this movie it would just have to be a well written film cause that would be the opposite of this.
