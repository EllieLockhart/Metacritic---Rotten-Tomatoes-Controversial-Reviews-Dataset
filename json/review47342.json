Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a waste of time. Nothing was really accomplished in this film. Can someone please tell me why Finn was given any screen time ? He accomplishes absolutely none of the tasks he sets out to do. \\n\\nAnyway\\, no one does much of anything\\, Luke isn't Luke\\, but just Mark Hamill dressed up as Luke\\, the force can just do kinda whatever each director dreams up\\, and everything is terrible. \\n\\nBut ultimately\\, stalling for time is a major theme in this movie. A recurring theme\\, so clever. Anyways all the director was doing was stalling for time until another director can come along and take care of the final movie.","true":true}
