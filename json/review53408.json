Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing!!! This film was an bloated utter mess. The Last Jedi fell flat on so many levels. The editing\\, tone\\, and pacing are so far from what we have seen in any other Star Wars film. There is no central story. The plot is a mixed bag of failed attempts to do things to save other things that never pan out. Nothing gets accomplished by any of the characters in the film that they set out to do. The ending of this film doesn\u2019t set anything up for the final part of this new trilogy. The attempts at comedy fall flat\\, and none of the questions that were posed in the Force Awakens are answered in the Last Jedi. In fact I was left with many WTF moments watching the film. ( Leia floating in space\\, Yoda telling Luke that Rey needs no training\\, even though he trained Jedi for 800 years\\, lame fight between Phasma and Finn\\, Hologram\/ solid Force Luke Skywalker just dies at the end.) There are a few bright spots in the film. (Kylo Ren has an actual character arc\\, Rey and Kylo Force connection\\, Luke and R2-D2 reconnecting\\, Snokes royal guards fight scene) The film just doesn\u2019t know what to do with itself. Even though the Force Awakens was a remake of A New Hope\\, the film was tight and had a well constructed plot. More importantly the last scene of the Force Awakens had me excited for the sequel\\, sadly the Last Jedi does not. ","true":true}
