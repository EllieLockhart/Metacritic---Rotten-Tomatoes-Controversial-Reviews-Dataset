Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SIMPLY AWFUL.  A COMPLETE BETRAYAL OF THE STORY AND ALL THE OTHER MOVIES - YES\\, EVEN THE DAMNED PREQUELS!!  \\n\\nHERE WE GO...\\n\\n  -  INDEFENSIBLE WASTE OF OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE OLDER CHARACTERS\\, PARTICULARLY LUKE SKYWALKER WHO WAS RUTHLESSLY TRASHED\\n  -  THE UTTERLY LAUGHABLE AND PATHETIC \\\"NEW ORDER\\\" - MORE LIKE THE NEW SPACEBALLS!\\n  -  ONE-DIMENSIONAL NEW CHARACTERS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A SHIT ABOUT UNLESS YOU'RE FIVE YEARS OLD!\\n  -  UNFORGIVABLE SHOE-HORNING IN OF THE WRITERS\/DIRECTORS\/STUDIOS REAL-WORLD POLITICS AT THE EXPENSE OF TELLING THE STAR WARS STORY. CYNICALLY USING STAR WARS AS A PLATFORM TO MASS DUPE YOUNG PEOPLE INTO FOLLOWING AN EXTREMIST LEFT-WING AGENDA (I PERSONALLY DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO RIGHT- OR LEFT-WING POLITICS)\\n  -  DUMPING WHAT WAS SET UP AND IMPLIED IN THE FORCE AWAKENS TO GRATIFY THE EGO OF THE NEW DIRECTOR AND WRITER - NOT THAT I WAS A FAN OF TFA EITHER!\\n  -  A \\\"STORY\\\" RIDDLED WITH PLOT HOLES\\n  -  A DIABOLICAL SCRIPT\\n  -  THE MAKERS\\, WHEN CALLED OUT ABOUT THIS PILE OF TRIPE\\, START CALLING FANS WHO ARE (IN THE MAIN) GOOD\\, DECENT HARD-WORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOVED SW THEIR WHOLE LIVES\\, RACISTS\\, SEXISTS\\, UNEDUCATED IDIOTS\\, WHITE SUPREMACISTS\\, TRANSPHOBIC\\, [INSERT IMPLIED THOUGHT-CRIME HERE]\\, ETC.\\, WHEN THEY ARE NOTHING OF THE SORT. THEY'RE JUST CALLING YOU OUT ON THE QUALITY OF THIS DROSS!!\\n\\nITS A DISMAL TIME TO BE A LONG-STANDING STAR WARS FAN.  I GENUINELY WISH NO FURTHER MOVIES HAD BEEN MADE AFTER ROTJ AND THAT WE STILL HAD THE GREAT EXPANDED UNIVERSE AS THE TRUE CONTINUATION OF THE STAR WARS SAGA.\\n\\nI WILL NOT BE WATCHING \\\"SOLO\\\" OR ANY FURTHER STAR WARS MOVIES PRODUCED BY DISNEY AND LUCASFILM.
