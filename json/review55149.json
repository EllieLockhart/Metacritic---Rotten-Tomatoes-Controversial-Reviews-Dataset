Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was very excited to see this movie\\, but left feeling wanting more.  I left with a lot of questions that I feel will never be answered.  Without giving to many spoilers away.  I feel they did Luke and Phasma dirty. Why did the first movie focus on this map to Luke if he wanted to die on his island of sadness?  Why was there even a map to begin with?  What's up with the Knight of Ren?  Are they not a thing anymore?  Why build up Snoke so much if your just going to kill him without giving us any backstory?\\n\\nThis movie seemed so disconnected from The Force Awakens.  The acting was great\\, the music and special effects were awesome too.  The major problem I had was with the pacing and the plot of the film.\\n\\nI had expected to leave the theater wanting more\\, as I did with The Force Awakens\\, but overall I feel like this film is a huge step backward for the franchise\\, which is upsetting.\\n\\nWhere do they go from here?  It seems like they have painted themselves in a corner as far as plot goes and all of the motivation it drained from this trilogy about an hour or so into the film.  Maybe the rise of Darth Jar Jar isn't so far fetched after all because I do not see where they could possibly go for the last film in the trilogy.\\n\\nI wish It was so much better.","true":true}
