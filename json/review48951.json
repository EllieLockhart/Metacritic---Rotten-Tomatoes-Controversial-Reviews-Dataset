Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Worst Star Wars film ever made. Broke the Lore\\, broke the fanbase\\, filled to the brim with identity politics\\, plot absolutely sucks\\, no character development\\, and the assumption that they brought Luke Skywalker back is a lie--that was Jake Skywalker\\, not our Luke. Killed Admiral Ackbar needlessly\\, treated women worse than ever in that it painted them as emotionless and temper mental with a hint of clinical insanity. Took a dinosaur sized crap on Star Wars fans everywhere\\, and worse\\, the creators of the film are now labeling true fans with legitimate criticisms as racist\\, sexist\\, overweight white supremacist man babies. This film even had the gall to reverse how the Light Side and Dark Side of the Force work\\, and killed off the main villain pointlessly.\\n\\nThis is objectively the worst film I have EVER seen\\, and I have seen a lot of films. Don't watch it\\, not even if you want to waste your time and money on this garbage\\, it isn't worth it friends.","true":true}
