Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If i could give it less stars i would. the plot was trash and forced sjw agendas from the writers. I watch movies to escape this reality and go to the one far far away now disney has brought this universe to the one from my childhood and it makes me extremely upset and it needs to be scrapped and redone. at the very least the last jedi. It doesn't even feel like a star wars movie and was made for this new sensitive generation.","true":true}
