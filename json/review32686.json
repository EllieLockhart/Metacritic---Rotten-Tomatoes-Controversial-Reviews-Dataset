Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the most bold entry in the saga yet\\, as it tackles Luke Skywalker's issues and deals with them head on. The imagery and symbolism does play a key part in telling Luke's story\\, as he is represented by the symbol in the main cave: A little bit of darkness within\\, but light without. Luke is the Yin and Yang\\, the duality of the story\\, as are the Light and the Dark side that are found in the Force. \\nThe theme of the light overcoming the darkness is a central part of the Skywalker legacy\\, and Luke is the personification of it throughout the film: Darkness of guilt and regrets holding him back\\, only to be gloriously reborn in the Force in the end. It's a huge task perfectly delivered by the writer\/director Rian Johnson.\\nSW: TFA delivered a tested and a re-used storyline from SW: ANH; SW: TLJ introduces the audience into something else. Bring on Episode IX\\, J.J!","true":true}
