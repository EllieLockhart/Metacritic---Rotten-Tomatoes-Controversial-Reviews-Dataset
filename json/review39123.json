Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This didn't even really feel like a Star Wars movie. I'm all for doing new things\\, but it still needs to feel like it belongs. There were a few things I liked\\, but I can count those on one hand and that is something I never wanted to have to say about a Star Wars movie. The pacing is off\\, the subplots are uninteresting\\, the 'new' force powers are jarring and the whole thing just ends up feeling like poor fanfiction.","true":true}
