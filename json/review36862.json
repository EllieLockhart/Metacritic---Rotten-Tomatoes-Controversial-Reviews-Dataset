Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The movie was amazing at it continued the epic storyline of star wars but it also had new secrets unveiled as well as new mysteries to be known later. The movie itself had a great story and some funny situations. It was also pretty cool in the way they presented the new force powers. Great movie for any star wars fan. 10\/10","true":true}
