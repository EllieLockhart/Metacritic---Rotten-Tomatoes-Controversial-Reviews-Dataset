Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"For me\\, this movie was like Fruit Stripe gum. My first viewing was like the first piece of chewy goodness that created an  explosion of colors and flavors that brought my childhood rushing back in an instant. This is exactly what I remembered. This is amazing\\, I could chew on this fore...wait a minute. The more I chew the worse it gets. Ill just get another piece. Uh...that didn't last long and the only flavor left is peach. Why do I have to try so hard to enjoy something? Metaphors aside\\, I keep trying to like this movie but I just give up half way through. It just looses its flavor and I have to spit it out.","true":true}
