Some light environmental puzzles and a whole bunch of resource scavenging round out the simple but effective post apocalypse gameplay. These parts of the game are a big improvement over Part I. Unfortunately the story in Part II is much worse. The writers try very hard to make the audience sympathize with the new main character Abby but it just doesn't work. The story takes a lot of wrong turns\\, spends too much time on side quests\\, and really drags during the second half. Ellie sits out the two best boss battles in the game. Joel is not even a playable character. On top of all this the ending is very disappointing and makes the whole journey seem like a waste of time.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
