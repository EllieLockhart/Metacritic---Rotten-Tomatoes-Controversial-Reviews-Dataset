Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointment in every possible way. The way Luke was treated\\, the plot holes so big a Death Star could pass through them\\, weird choices meant only to be a plot driver and nothing else. I was convinced this would be better than The Force Awakens\\, but boy was i wrong. I don't even care what happens in Ep. IX anymore. Wasted characters\\, stupid choices\\, terrible writing. I would rather watch a Jar Jar focused trilogy than anything Rian Johnson ever writes again.","true":true}
