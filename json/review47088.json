Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a horrible movie\\, this captures none of the charm of any of the originals\\, it even fails to capture what JJ had managed with the nostalgia of TFA.\\n\\nCarrie Poppins is literally the worst thing I've seen on screen\\, ever. Plus it's clear\\, Lucasfilm or at least Rian Johnson has a vendetta against Luke Skywalker. I don't think they get that without Luke\\, there is no star wars. ","true":true}
