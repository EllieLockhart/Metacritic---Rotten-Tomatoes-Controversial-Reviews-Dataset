Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As a long time star wars fan that read expended universe and everything disney dismissed ? am very very dissapointed. Like how can something like this can happen. This new director didn't even know the events and plot of Force Aweakens. You have the intention to make Kylo Ren the main villan then turn him into a badass when killing Snoke and make him the new Vader.Change the god awful Rey and Finn especially why bring in a new Gungan-Chineese Po shit fest. I thought Rey and Finn had no backstory and charakter development but its on a new level. My god how I miss Grand Admiral Thrawn and Yuuzhan Vong","true":true}
