Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"ok i understand the need to please all age groups and be light hearted (call me grumpy!) but there was far too much comedy and one liners in this movie\\, even Yoda has developed a sense of humour! Yes the action scenes were very good but after the hype fades away people will see it being much the same as force awakens. The pace of the movie is confusing.....Rey is a Jedi maters in matter of days . For me Rogue One proved what could be done with a star wars movie more closely aligned to the originals. And why have we been left with one terrible evil villain Kylo Ren.......","true":true}
