Naughty Dog have not only set the bar they moved it so far it's going to be awhile before anyone can reach it! I braced myself for a horrible travesty of a game after reading the negative reactions but this game delivered everytime I turned around. The story and pacing for me were excellent.! Ellie was written perfectly  and when here quest for revenge starts to eat away at her you feel it. Somewhere along the line she starts to think what am I becoming and you can tell it she is turning into someone she doesn't like. And\\,playing as Abby is just as powerful someone you want to hate but you're forced to see she is just a person just like Ellie who went through with her quest for revenge and learns that it wasn't worth it and didn't change anything for her. Two sides of the same coin that show revenge is never the answer especially in a world where the ultimate fight is to try to hold on to their humanity. It's not easy but sometimes the fight to stay human is the hardest one of all and this game illustrates that point perfectly! Excellent lesson for the times we live in today!\u2026 Expand","true":true}
