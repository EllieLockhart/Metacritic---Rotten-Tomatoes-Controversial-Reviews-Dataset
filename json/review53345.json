Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't believe all of the cry-baby millenials who are too cool for something new and different in the Star Wars universe. These are the same wimps who cried when they thought The Force Awakens was too similar to A New Hope.  They don't know what they want and it's a good thing they have no say.\\n\\nThe Last Jedi is nothing short of an epic thrill ride that brings Star Wars lore and drops it right at your feet where it whisks you up and answers many burning questions in a new and fascinating way.  Rian Johnson stepped out and took chances that have never been seen in this classic tale.\\n\\nAs someone who saw Star Wars in the theatre in 1977\\, and an avid geek off the franchise I loved this movie. It's just what the saga needed.\\n\\nGo. Again and then again.  And enjoy.","true":true}
