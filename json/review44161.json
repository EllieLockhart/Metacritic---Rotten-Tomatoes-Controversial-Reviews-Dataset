Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To hybrid quote a friend\\, \u201cThis is the boldest Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back.\u201d He said Return of the Jedi. My argument is that Return of the Jedi wasn\u2019t bold because it played everything safe. This film and Empire are the only two films in the Skywalker Saga that do not play things safe. If you\u2019re not a drooling theorist\\, who literally wanted Rey to be related to everyone in the galaxy\\, then you\u2019re probably like me and actually enjoyed this film. It\u2019s not a perfect movie but it does a lot of things well. All Easter Eggs aside the film does a great job of picking up right where the last one left off. It has some beautiful scenery and the best acting in the entire saga. The cinematography is fun and pays homage to some classic films specifically on Canto Bight. The sets were gorgeous as well\\, Snoke\u2019s chambers have to be the coolest looking set in a movie I\u2019ve seen in a while. I could on and on at well the film was crafted but that\u2019s to be expected with a multimillion dollar budget. I think the best thing about this movie are the themes that have been implemented. Without spoiling too much\\, Disney is saying\\, \u201cAnyone can be special\\, in a galaxy far\\, far away.\u201d Like it or not\\, how are they supposed to continue making these movies based on actors who are in their 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s? I\u2019ll admit my first go around I was very surprised where this movie went because I didn\u2019t expect the film to go that way at all. Isn\u2019t that why we spend $15 on a movie ticket though? Even some of the things most of the internet has a problem with... at first I was right there with the internet but after thinking about the events\\, in the context of the film\\, most of them make sense. Which brings me to my next point\\, saying this movie is bad because it didn\u2019t go the way you wanted it to go isn\u2019t a fair assessment of anything. That\u2019s called being entitled not being a true fan. A true fan doesn\u2019t say the movie shouldn\u2019t be canon because they didn\u2019t like the installment. A true fan watches\\, walks out of the theater\\, and into the next showing to better understand the film. A true fan doesn\u2019t say that Disney ruined Star Wars because a true fan remembers seeing the Prequel Trilogy\\, over and over again\\, from 1999 through 2005 when Star Wars newbies said the same thing. This is a good film and a welcome installment to the Star Wars Franchise in my book. If for some reason you haven\u2019t seen it yet go see it because it\u2019s a lot of fun and it\u2019s a good one to see in the theater. If you\u2019ve been reluctant because you\u2019ve heard bad things from fans remember the internet is a domino effect. Meaning that most people don\u2019t think for themselves. They hear from someone in their newsfeed that Star Wars was bad and then they feed into it. The reason the film is sitting at 52% from fans on Rotten Tomatoes is because a fan with a following asked his followers to review bomb the movie until it was removed from the Star Wars canon. On that note I\u2019ll leave you with this. I read an article the other day that published about a week after Empire Strikes Back came out. The article talked about how a lot of fans were disappointed or in denial to find out the Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker\u2019s Dad. Sound familiar?","true":true}
