Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"As an artist\\, aspiring filmmaker and ex-physics student I can tell you that this is a terrible movie in every regard and an even worse star wars movie. Such incoherent\\,incompetent and uninspired writing and woefully bad editing\/pacing. I'm truly baffled about how anyone capable of logic and any shred of film-knowledge could come to any other conclusion. Because the movie is logically inconsistent and incoherent to the highest degree. I'd be confident enough that I could prove it on a chalkboard - it's that blatantly obvious and NOT at all an issue of taste or fandom. Shame on every professional critic who gave this a positive review - you don't deserve to be a published critic of cinema and you're a disgrace to your profession. I signed up to this site to give this the review it deserves and because I'm supremely confident that given a debate I could best any critic on this\\, anywhere\\, anytime. Please don't watch it","true":true}
