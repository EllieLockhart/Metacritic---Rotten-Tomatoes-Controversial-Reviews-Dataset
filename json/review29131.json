Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really upset... How many cheesy 1 liners can you cram into 2 hours. I counted 4 \\\"deus ex machina's\\\" and imo 1 is enough to spoil a movie for me. A severe lack of practical props. Back to the OL C.G.I. for everything. Amazing plugs for merch though...  I hope it is me who is out of touch\\, and this movie isn't truly as awe-full as i thought it was.","true":true}
