Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie gets better the 2nd time you watch it. All those fans out there that are but hurt about certain aspects of this film need to give it another chance and go in with an open mind. This movie may not be what you were expecting. After watching it a 2nd time I can say this movie is one of the best in the franchise. It's never going to be as good as the originals\\, we shouldn't really be surprised by that. It is however a better movie than Episode 1\\, 2\\, 3 and dare I say 7 (I loved 7 by the way). Do yourself a favor. If you've seen it. See it again with an open mind and pay attention\\, there are a lot of fantastic moments in this film. Don't let the little things like a little too much comic relief ruin it for you.","true":true}
