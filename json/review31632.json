Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"So on top of the weak plot\\, disrespect to the saga as a whole\\, and putrid treatment of beloved characters such as Finn\\, Poe\\, Rey\\, Leia\\, and Luke (especially Luke)\\, Rian Johnson has proven that he's childish and unprofessional and will do anything to discredit valid criticism and mock devoted fans. \\n\\nGiving this movie 1 star is being generous. The cast deserved better. Fans deserved better.","true":true}
