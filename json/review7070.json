Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Elements of old and new in this. This is a movie about finding your place\\, choices and sacrifice. You can whine about things you wanted to see or not see in\\, or just enjoy Star Wars.","true":true}
