Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I have been a Star Wars fan since 1977 when the first film arrived in theaters. I am a hardcore die hard fan. With that said this is by far the worst Star Wars film ever made. I even enjoyed the Prequels after several views and understood Lucas' vision. Not only do they betray his vision they betray his beloved characters. Luke is supposed to be the most powerful Jedi ever and his story line to bring the force into balance was completely abandoned. The movie is long\\, the new characters are boring. Plot holes galore and the potential characters are never developed. Even Snokes backstory is never touched on. It is just a terrible terrible mess. I would go as far as to say this is the worst sci fi movie ever. Sharknado has more entertainment value. Don't waste your time or money.","true":true}
