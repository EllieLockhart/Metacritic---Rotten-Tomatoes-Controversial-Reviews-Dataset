I have spent more time playing mahjong and dancing at the disco than I have in the main story.  It's packed full of fun content and worth every penny.  For a medium that ultimately boils down to whether you'll have fun\\, I can't imagine anyone not finding something here they will love and keeping coming back to.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
