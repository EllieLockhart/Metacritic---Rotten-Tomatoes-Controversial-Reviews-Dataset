Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The Screenwriters\\,Director\\, And Disney should be so ashamed of this disgrace to all true fans of a classic story that changed Cinema forever. To see such a cheap\\, shallow\\, and disrespectful take on characters loved throughout the world is so disappointing but after some thought almost expected at this point. Luke you deserve better\\, the true fans of all ages truly apologize for this travesty of a film.","true":true}
