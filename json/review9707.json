Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good sci-fi movie\\, bad Star Wars movie. There was very little use of lightsabers\\, philosophy on the Force\\, or use of Force Powers in general. The middle of the movie drags a bit. It's a well made movie\\, but it's gonna leave Star Wars fans disappointed.","true":true}
