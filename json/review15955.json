Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I made an account just so i could give this movie a bad review - Fundamentally shattered my childhood love of Star Wars.\\n\\nAs a fan of the prequels and the original trilogy and even TFA\\, i was so excited for this movie to build on the nostalgia from TFA and expand into a deeper richer storyline that focussed on 'world - building' as well as answering some of the questions from JJ Abrhams movie. \\n\\nInstead we got Leia Poppins\\, a horrible unreferenced death for Admiral Ackbar\\, a slow-speed chase\\, porgs\\, a Gringotts escape scene and not to mention the destruction of Cinemas most beloved character: Luke Skywalker.\\n\\nFans have waited 30 years to see him back in action\\, and instead he was barely recognisable. \\n\\nUtterly crushed for the fans and Mark Hammil that it had to end this way.\\n\\nAnd what was the point of the Rose\/Finn storyline? Nothing.\\nWhat a pile of strange\\, plot-holed\\, confusing trash :(","true":true}
