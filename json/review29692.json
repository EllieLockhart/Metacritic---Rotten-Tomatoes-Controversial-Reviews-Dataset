Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Rian Johnson took a big risk and it paid off. The movie is a ton of fun with great acting all around. Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac are the two best performances in my opinion\\, but again the cast was really impressive. The movie was shot beautifully and the fight scenes in particular were jaw-dropping. A really really fun movie to see and one that will please the fans if they give it a chance. There is one sequence that it's a little drawn out and doesn't work very well\\, but the rest of the movie is incredible! AWESOME installment into this saga!","true":true}
