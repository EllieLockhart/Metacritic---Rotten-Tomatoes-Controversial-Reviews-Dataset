Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Best Star Wars ever! Before Episode VIII I cared very little for the franchise. I went into this film wanting to see some explosions and then move on. I left with a new appreciation for Star Wars. Unbelievable! I obviously don\u2019t understand the hatred from all the others\\, but whatever. It was awesome!","true":true}
