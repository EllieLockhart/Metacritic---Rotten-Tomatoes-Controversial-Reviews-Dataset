Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This was one of the best star wars films. I really enjoyed seeing the characters grow and change.  The twists were great and i was on the edge of ny seat.  It was something new and not a rehash of previous films. I also enjoy the new depth added to the force.  And once again it drives home the fact that ANYONE can be a jedi\\, capturing the awe i had as a child.","true":true}
