Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"About 30% of this movie is good. The rest is a false \\\"narrative\\\" that has nothing to do with the bigger picture\\, inserted to stretch out the run time of the film. It is too long and worst of all\\, at times even boring... oh\\, and it was not funny.","true":true}
