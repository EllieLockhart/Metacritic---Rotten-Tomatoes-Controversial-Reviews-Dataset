Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I've read every single user review before doing mine\\, and it seems that there are too many dissapointed fans becuse of a reveal that I'm not going to spoil. Those who are dissapointed should rethink this again since this reveal has a great meaning for the kids that will see this movie.\\n\\nNow I can safely say that this movie is far better than Episode VII. Rian provided answers to most of what I wanted and some great twists to keep me engaged. I love Star Wars\\, but I only care about the episodes (the spin-offs just don't make the cut for me) so after waiting for two years for this movie I am happy to say it was worth the wait.","true":true}
