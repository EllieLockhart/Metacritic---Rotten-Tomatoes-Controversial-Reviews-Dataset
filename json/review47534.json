Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What should be a perfect movie with a great main plot is sadly let down by amateur writers with no knowledge of the Star Wars EU\\, and short-term memory loss. The plot holes will irk everyone that watches this the first time but give it a 2nd viewing and you will grow to appreciate the meat of the story.","true":true}
