Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Depressingly shallow movie with zero to negative character development\\, cliches galore\\, pathetic attempts at cheesy jokes\\, wasted cameo appearances by historic characters\\, rushed production\\, needless filler scenes\\, poor writing\\, spastic scene jumping designed for someone with attention deficit disorder\\, brutally long and boring\\, horrible horrible horrible.  It is an absolute disgraceful movie.  Why are some storm troopers now female wearing skirts?  Why are all the bad guys pasty white men and all the leaders a diverse group of social justice warriors and animal rights activists?  This movie is such a betrayal you have to see it to understand- but you shouldn't waste your money\\, so don't see it.","true":true}
