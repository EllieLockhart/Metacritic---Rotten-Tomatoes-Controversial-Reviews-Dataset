{"101487":169460,"Last Jedi":"Last Jedi","2017-12-15":"2017-12-18","3":2,"A lot of twists and deaths. I feel like the time on the island was a waste of time. Very little was accomplished. Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"SPOILERS:\\nFor a Star Wars fan\\, such as myself\\, the film was disappointing\\, mostly in a sense that it didn't make sense and characters were ruined.\\n* LUKE (1): The man who once went on a suicide mission to save his father who was corrupted by the dark side because he believed that these is still good in him\\, now decides to kill a kid who is visibly still conflicted. That's not what Luke would do.\\n* LUKE (2): Upon traveling to his jedi island he left a map for others to find him in a time of need. And when they do\\, he says \\\"I came here to die\\\". Not only is this coward's words that do not suit Luke\\, but then why leave a map in the first place? Makes no sense.\\n* LUKE (3): When the projection of Luke said to Kylo \\\"see you around\\, kid\\\" and then he was shown on his island\\, the audience started cheering and clapping\\, and myself with them. This was brilliant\\, a genius plan. But then he just died. And everyone was confused\\, like \\\"what happened?\\\". And really\\, this death was a coward's death\\, that didn't suit Luke at all. If he was going to die anyway\\, why not come to Kylo and have a final showdown himself? Also\\, I there there would have been a perfectly valid reason to keep him alive at the end\\, on that cliff\\, just meditating.\\n* SNOKE: The mysterious setup from force awakens was thrown to the garbage. We learned nothing and he died the most cartoonish way possible. \\\"He'll never betray me! Oh no\\, he betrayed me\\\".\\n* PHASMA: Another character who was thrown to the garbage. After the failure in TFA\\, she could have done so much more here. Instead she stumbled upon Finn by accident (which is DJ) didn't shoot when she could\\, and then died.\\n* CASINO WORLD: Ok\\, with pointless death and ruined characters out of the way\\, let's talk about pointless plots. The whole subplot of casino world was pointless and was easily preventable if the resistance leaders have told their captains of their plan to head stealthily for the moon base. Then Finn wouldn't need to find the code breaker\\, who in turn whouldn't have betrayed them\\, lives would have been saved\\, and\\, maybe\\, more integral plot would have been designed instead. Also\\, this segment felt like the prequels with slapstick humor and overabundance of CGI.\\n* FINN: When Finn decided to head for the cannon himself\\, that would have been perfect moment to say goodbye to the character. Epic sacrifice\\, even though technically\\, those at-ats would have obliterated him before he reached the cannon. And Rose as well\\, for that matter. Oh man\\, the more I think about it. . .\\n* KYLO: Despite the fact that Kylo had basically no arc\\, he was the same conflicted person both at the beginning and at the end of the film\\, Kylo couldn't see that projection of Luke used a blue lightsaber\\, which he and Ray torn apart and also\\, that Luke didn't leave any red marks of salt when he walked. And\\, most importantly\\, how could he not sense that Luke isn't actually there? He deceived the supposedly god-like Snoke who could read everyone's minds and shoot lightnings just by barely lifting fingers\\, yet he couldn't sense or see such an obvious trickery? What?\\n* RAY: Even though I don't believe what Kylo said about her parents was true\\, it would be a shame if it were. Just like with Snoke\\, I feel like it takes away from the importance of character\\, when you decide that anyone can be the next Skywalker or the next Emperor. Also\\, it's lazy writing as well. It doesn't take to be creative or engaged to say \\\"my character is so good at what he\/she does is because. . . I said so.\\\" This happened to both Ray and Snoke here.\\n* VERDICT: I think mr. Rian Johnson crapped on the legacy of Luke\\, crapped on the work that J.J. Abrams did in TFA\\, did not resolve the film in a satisfying way\\, and\\, for that matter\\, did not set up episode IX properly either. Ray is a nobody\\, big bad is done\\, kylo will have to be the main villain\\, Luke's gone\\, unlike after TFA\\, where we as an audience still had hooks and questions\\, we have none of that now.","true":true}
