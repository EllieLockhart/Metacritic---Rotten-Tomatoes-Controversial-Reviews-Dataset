Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This movie forces you to analyse the actions and foreshadowing of the story in order to arrive at a deeper meaning that any other Star Wars story before it.  It's ironic that some fans have a problem with that\\, given that they usually analyse every word and action of the original trilogy.  After some time passes\\, this will go down as one of the top 5 best Star Wars movies of all time.","true":true}
