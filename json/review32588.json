Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a disaster. It is not only a complete fail as a Star Wars film in the eyes of a well-versed fan\\, it is simply a bad movie in general. \\nThe Force Awakens laid a base for the new trilogy\\, albeit shaky\\, introducing new yet-to-be-developed characters\\, and a world that looks familiar but feels nothing like the established universe. With the public divided and somewhat unconvinced\\, the sequel had to expand on its predecessor's foundation\\, shedding light on the questions raised and progressing characters' storylines in a meaningful fashion\\, giving their personalities more dimension. Star Wars: The Last Jedi fails entirely at the tasks at hand. \\nApart from The Last Jedi's numerous supermassive plot holes\\, sudden and ineffective tonal shifts\\, and characters that remain one-dimensional after yet another 2 and a half hours of screen time\\, the film's storyline is zig-zagging from one unnecessary or questionable event to another. As an audience\\, all we are left with is to ponder the question \\\"Why?\\\" \\n\\nThe motivation behind the characters' actions is often left unexplained\\, giving them a false sense of complexity. The dialogues are unnatural and very much clich\u00e9. The bad jokes jump right in the middle of a serious build-up\\, shifting the tone dramatically\\, then disappear just as suddenly\\, leaving us completely detached from whatever emotional situation is unrolling on the screen. Significant characters come into the picture and are immediately written off\\, leaving us completely unsatisfied.\\nFor a long-time Star Wars fan\\, The Last Jedi has little to offer other than a few bitter-sweet moments with Luke Skywalker\\, Leia Organa and Master Yoda\\, scavenging off the strong sense of nostalgia. As to the simple visual entertainment\\, apart from one or two enjoyable CGI moments there is neither a good ol' lightsabre duel nor a grand space battle to wow us. \\nAll in all\\, it is an empty husk of a film under a shiny and money-making label of Star Wars. Good job\\, Disney\\, I hope you have made your profit.","true":true}
