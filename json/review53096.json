Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A terrible film. The story begins and ends in the same place and accomplishes nothing through its nonsensical story beats. Character development was poor and confusing. Motivations are constantly unclear. Characters constantly make nonsensical decisions. The movie tries to make points but those add up to nothing as well. Politics should have no place in movies. Just make something truthful and well thought out! The movie is also filled with too many CGI creatures that added nothing to the story\\, and were simply onscreen because they had way too much money to spend. The pacing is glacial and the whole plot of them being chased for like two days straight without the first order being able to take out their shields is just plain silly. And the final scene where they have those incredibly useless gliders that have to keep contact with the sand for no reason at all was ridiculous. This movie is just so\\, so\\, so stupid.","true":true}
