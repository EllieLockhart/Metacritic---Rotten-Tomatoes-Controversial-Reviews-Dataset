Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A completely disjointed story that does not fit within the ethos of what the previous Star wars films created.  The plot holes are too significant to make any portion of the film enjoyable.  The character development is lazy and nonsensical.  A terrible film that was seen once and will not be viewed again.","true":true}
