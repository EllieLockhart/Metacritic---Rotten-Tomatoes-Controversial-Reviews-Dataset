Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you thought The Force Awakens was bad\\, prepared to be disappointed. If you thought The Force Awakens was good\\, prepared to be disappointed as well. \\n\\nThe biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it completely ignores everything about the Original Trilogy\\, the Prequel Trilogy\\, and even Episode VII.  As a long time fan\\, I am aware Star Wars needs a new direction away from massive destruction weapons and orphans from desert planets. Unfortunately\\, the execution of TLJ was not the way to turn a new page. The end result is a movie that outright ignores character development and abruptly ends old storylines. Snoke\\, Phasma\\, and General Hux are completely inconsequential as a characters. Their origins are not explained. One of the most disappointing parts of the movie is Snoke's death\\, which makes TFA largely irrelevant. While Finn and Rose are interesting characters\\, their sub plot in this movie was completely forced and out of place. Beloved characters like General Ackbar\\, Luke\\, and Leiah are gone without any real resolution to their stories.\\n\\nOne of the earliest scenes between Luke\\, Rey\\, and Anakin's lightsaber sums up the whole movie: Rian Johnson was given the holy grail of the Star Wars Universe and he just threw it over his shoulder. \\n\\n[SPOILER ALERT!!!] If you watched Episode 4: Return of the Jedi\\, no need to watch the sequels. The Jedi never make it back to the galaxy.","true":true}
