Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"not good\\, it is long disjointed\\, it doesn't relate to star wars lore\\, I understand trying to make a new star wars and viewpoint. Just make one with a good story that doesn't stink. It is not good. Luke Skywalker story is horrible in this movie. It is just all bad. I prefer the new star trek movies to star wars and I LOVED STAR WARS.","true":true}
