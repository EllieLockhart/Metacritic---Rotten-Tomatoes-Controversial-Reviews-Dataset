Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"The technical traits of the game like the graphics and the gameplay are great. The flashback of Joel singing to Ellie and the surprise he had for her birthday were beautiful moments too.But the storyline...What were they thinking??? Honestly I think many people will agree with me that this whole game was a huge slap in the face from ND. The fact that the characters didn't have character development at all and they just forgot what was really important about the story. The \\\"revenge is bad\\\" theme could've been taught in many other ways better than this failure. We didn't see what happened to Ellie's parents\\, her immunity to the virus seems insignificant at this point\\, we couldn't see more of Joel's past in order to understand his character even more and we didn't get to see enough of Ellie's and Joel's relationship. This game had so much potential and the final product was just an excuse of a game with a more than obvious forced agenda that they forgot what really mattered. And if they tried to make me feel emphatic towards Abby they didn't succeed at all\\, not after how terribly this character was written. And it's no fun that I had to play as her either when I never developed a connection with her in the first place. And the fact that they used Joel to make false advertisement of the game by tricking us into believing that he was alive. Just wow. And not to mention the way he died. That was SO disrespectful to Joel's character and the fans. A character that beloved deserved better. I'm okay with that fact that he died\\, but the WAY he died\\, I'm just extremely sad and disappointed. For someone who doesn't have a real father myself and the fact that their father and daughter relationship was something I really treasured and loved and they just destroyed that by having loved characters acting out of character and seeing Ellie acting all rude towards Joel and they couldn't even have a chance to work things out between them it just leaves me heartbroken. They were the essence of the game and now that has vanished for me and I'm sure many feel the same way. I was really hoping this was going to be a beautifully crafted story but I guess the wallet was more important than actual storytelling. Maybe this will teach them that caring for their fans\\, story and characters is better rather than pushing a message that just comes out as forced and negative.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
