Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Similar to Justice League\\, this is a movie that\\, when I first watched\\, I found myself saying\\, \\\"wow\\, this is exciting\\,\\\" but after months and months of thinking about this film\\, I came to the realization that this movie was wildly unlikable. Filled with enormous plot holes\\, predictability\\, and a surprisingly frustrating storyline\\, it was very hard for me to remember something about this movie that I loved -- which were the action sequences. The special effects were incredible and the action itself was very entertaining\\, but it couldn't save the movie from it's unanswered questions and wasted characters\\, along with a horrible storyline that only extended the film's runtime. - 45%","true":true}
