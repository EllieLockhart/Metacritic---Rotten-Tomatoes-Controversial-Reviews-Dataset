Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Really enjoyed it.  I am a lifelong fan.  Hated the prequels.  I have not had mad cap theories and decided my ideas were right before seeing this fantastic children's movie.","true":true}
