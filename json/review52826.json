Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A lot of people complaining about the last jedi. I liked it. Is it an old school star wars movie? No. Is that a bad thing. Nope\\, not at all. I much prefer a different story than the same old same old. Does it have plot holes? Yep\\, it definitely does. And yes there is a whole part that seems like a big waste of time. But I see a value in the waste of time. There is a point to this movie. A small person (trying to avoid spoilers here) says a line that sums up the movie. When you take that line into account the whole thing makes sense. Knowing what I know now I am looking forward to watching it again alone so that I can really absorb the little details that I missed and appreciate the theme of the story.","true":true}
