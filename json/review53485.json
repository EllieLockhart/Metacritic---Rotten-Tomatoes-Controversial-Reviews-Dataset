Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't listen to folks complaining about this movie based on 'too much SJW' or 'ew feminism'\\, because those additions are admirable and progressive; this is just a bad movie that disregards its pedigree\\, throws away previous plot and character development often for a cheap laugh\\, and while there are a few visually stunning moments and great action sequences\\, they're a handful of ornaments hung from a broken skeleton of a plot draped in the cloak of Star Wars.","true":true}
