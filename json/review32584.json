Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"star wars the last Jedi is absolutely fantastic\\, the characters are more human than ever. many are giving this movie hate because of it\\, they wanted the characters to be these perfect idols that they grew up watching they wanted their fantasies fulfilled\\, the last Jedi dosent care about your fantasies\\, it doesent care about your fan theories\\, it doesn't care about what you want\\, the last jedi care only about telling a smart interesting story\\, and it succeeded\\, Starwars the last Jedi is\\, in my opinion\\, the best star wars movie yet.","true":true}
