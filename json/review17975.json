Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I think people are being really unfair when giving this a 1 star or even half a star rating. I have seen some VERY bad movies. I don't consider this the worst star wars movie. That spot is reserved for the Clone Wars and Rogue One (I can explain why I hate Rogue One so much) This is at least enjoyable as a movie. I do have legitimate complaints though. Some story wise and some disign wise. Like luke leaving early and not finishing his training with Yoda\\, I feel like te director quite 2\/3rds of the way and just made up the rest of the movie. He sets up these ideas and plot points in the first act of the movie that goes nowhere at the end. I had fun while in the theater\\, but leaving a lot of things just had me asking \\\"Well... what was the point?\\\" \\nIs this a good star wars movie? No. Is this a good movie? No. Is it the worst movie I have ever seen? No. Just.... don't expect too much if you still havent seen it.","true":true}
