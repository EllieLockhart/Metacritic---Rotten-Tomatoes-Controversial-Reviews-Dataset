We are talking about the game\\, not this kind of stuff. Trust me\\, this game is a MUST PLAY\\, and the bad score that has from the User became from the \\\"spoilers\\\" that went on the game.\u2026 Expand":"Summary: While it has better gameplay\\, awful pacing ruins the story and makes a narrative driven game suffer as a result.\r\rThere is no easy review of this game. The game isn't a ten nor a zero. It functions well\\, and has some improvements\\, but it isn't flawless. Not even close. The fact this game relies heavily on the story instead of gameplay really drags down the overall score.\r\rStory wise\\, it's biggest problem is pacing. It is **** awful. The current pacing of the story is: Be with Joel and Ellie until Joel's Death. Split between Ellie and the new character Abby\\, with a little more emphasis on Abby. Multiple flashbacks\\, and even flash backing in flashbacks (never do that ever.) Then the climax. The pacing is awful and should've been rewritten. Here's how I would've done it.\r\rStart off as Abby searching for a cure\rFinds out it doesn't exist because of Joel\rGoes on a manhunt for Joel (but doesn't know who it is)\rSwitch to Joel and Ellie\rBattles not only zombies\\, but also these slave traders that are in the game\rCrosses paths with Abby\rAbby\\, not knowing that is the right Joel\\, befriends them\rJoel and Ellie have their argument\rEllie tells Abby about Joel's decision (from LOS) in frustration\rAbby realizes that is the Joel she is searching for\rAbby (or someone else) kills Joel (Abby feels regret for doing so)\rEllie goes on her revenge trip\rAbby gets captured\rEllie finds Abby and have their final battle\rPlayer decision to either forgive or kill Abby.\r\rPuts that whole story in different context doesn't it? But that's just my thoughts.\r\rGameplay\\, Naughty Dog did improve it. Some tweaking with the aiming\\, and Abby is a good laugh to play as. She feels pretty OP\\, and it is a blast. Punching zombies\\, her unbelievable speed (with her body type)\\, she's hilarious and fun. I feel like it gets forgotten about because of her storyline.\r\rAnyway. It deserves the score it gets.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
