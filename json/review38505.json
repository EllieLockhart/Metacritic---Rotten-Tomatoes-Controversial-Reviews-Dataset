Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"The worst Star Wars film to date. Regret paying to see this film. It's little more than a vehicle to push current politics. Instead of character development\\, storyline\\, and quality actors\\, the director used underwhelming diversity hires\\, social justice tropes\\, and cheap gags. Mark Hamill was right\\, this film was just about making money. Begs the question\\, how soon could this film be remade? Highlights  of the film were Benicio del Toro and the cinematography.","true":true}
