Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Good action but a poor Star Wars movie. I'm not a fan boy or nerd. Just a neutral point of viewer. There are a lot of overly political correct\\, racist and sexist themes pushed through here as subliminal messaging. Very forced\\, stuff and unnecessary. I just wanted to watch a good movie and relax. I wish these people would stop screwing with entertainment to push their political views and just let people relax and enjoy a good story. \\n\\nSnoke finally became important and cool but then was killed off. Rey became distant and hard to connect with. The best change was Fin who finally developed courage and went from essentially being Walt Disney's Goofy in the first film\\, to a strong character with purpose in this film. \\n\\nEither way. So much done wrong. The real heroes and villains are gone with the weak ones left.","true":true}
