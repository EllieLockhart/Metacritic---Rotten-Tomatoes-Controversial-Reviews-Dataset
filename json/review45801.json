Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Very poor development and direction of characters. Lazy and frankly boring story lines. Lack of compelling antagonists or protagonists for that matter. This film subverts expectations.... but not in the good way. This film does a dis-service to the actors\\, characters and fans of the beloved Star Wars franchise with poor arcs and an in your face political and social agenda. If you love and care about Star wars; this is  not the film for you! Try the prequels they're more enjoyable :)","true":true}
