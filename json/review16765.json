Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"In my opinion\\, this isn't the best Star Wars film\\, but it certainly isn't the worst. I appreciated all the space battle scenes. I really loved seeing Carrie Fisher one last time. General Leia really was the heart and soul of the movie. Laura Dern deserves credit for her role. Was really wonderful to see her in it.\\nThe low points...Kylo Ren. Terrible villain. Just whiny and boring. Pace of the film. \\n\\nIt's a good film. Go see it.","true":true}
