Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi takes a lot of chances and tries things that have never been done in a Star Wars movie and for that I applaud it. Many of these elements work while some feel a little strange or fall completely flat.\\n\\nThe acting all round is a huge improvement from The Force Awakens and there are some really stand-out performances from Mark Hamill and Adam Driver.\\n\\nWith regards to Mark Hamill\\, many people don't or won't like what has become of Luke Skywalker but I feel that if he was the exact same character we saw thirty years previous\\, he would be mostly unnecessary and have nothing much to do within the film. The direction Rian Johnson took him gives him a history and a purpose and most importantly\\, a character arc with a fitting resolution.\\n\\n\\\"This is not going to go the way you think\\\" ... indeed.","true":true}
