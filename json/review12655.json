Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I consider myself a fan of all these movies to a degree\\, especially the first three\\, but this one did the series reputation no favours.  Even my 11yr old was not interested.  It tries hard to find the connection that A New Hope was able to develop with the characters\\, but fails. I felt nothing for them. Even the funny scenes did not make me laugh.  Chewie and that dash ornament critter. Really? I tried 3 times to get though this movie\\, third time was what it took.  Felt nothing for these characters\\, and have no desire to see what comes next.","true":true}
