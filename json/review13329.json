Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I enjoyed every second of this movie. I laughed\\, I cried\\, I gasped\\, and felt every emotion possible. While every storyline is interesting\\, I must say the dynamic between Rey\\, Kylo\\, and Luke is the one that I took most pleasure out of. No spoilers\\, but it is quite beautiful to watch unfold.","true":true}
