Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Sure\\, it wasn't perfect\\, but it was close enough to feel good about. Honestly\\, not sure why so many people are adding 0\\, 1\/2 star reviews. Did we watch the same movie? The audience I was in gave a hearty clap at the end (and a couple times during.)\\n\\nSPOLIERS FOLLOW (random observations)\\n- Rose\/Finn story line doesn't have the authenticity of Finn\/Rey - but it's an incomplete arc so we will see.\\n- Was the humor too corny? Not at all\\, it felt about a normal balance compared to past movies in the franchise.\\n- Was Luke disrespected? I say no. He did the right thing in the end\\, in a creative and important way. His actual death might have been executed slightly better - maybe.\\n- Snoke didn't get much development\\, it's true - but I think it's fine that it's all on Rey and Kylo now in IX.\\n- Rey's parents being \\\"nobody's\\\" - not a real problem - a sign that the Force isn't inherited like a disease and even a humble kid (as seen at the end) can be gifted. This is an arc that I'd expect they need to complete in IX (ripe for a twist of some sort).\\n- All in all\\, I think the biggest challenge for IX is to seamlessly lose General Organa before the show even starts. (I have to suspect the original plan had her having an emotional exit somewhere during IX.)","true":true}
