Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Probably the fairest way to judge this movie without saying it's absolutely awful or it's absolutely amazing is that it's a decent movie\\, but it's not a good star wars movie. As a star wars fan\\, this really hurt. There were too many plot holes and inconsistencies and they treated our beloved characters from old movies like a punching bag. If you've never seen a single star wars movie or you just don't care about the franchise\\, then you can enjoy this movie as it has good action\\, and a mildly entertaining story line. Overall it's just disappointing. ","true":true}
