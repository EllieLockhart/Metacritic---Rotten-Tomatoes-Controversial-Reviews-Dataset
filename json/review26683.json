Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Ok\\, let's start I gave this three stars to the acting\\, world building\\, and adaptation. As a stand alone movie or an episode of Star War Rebels  it will be great\\, but not as an awaited episode VIII. It lacked the political theme that all the Star Wars movies revolved around and George Lucas portrays on all of their movies\\, TFA made this a new beginning but this lacked the creativity of making continuity to the past movies. Finn I think should have died in this along with Rose\\, we love GOT as well and we are use to important characters dying so why not kill him\\, instead of taking screen time story. Also Snoke and the galaxies  lack of development gave 0 to the episode. And this movie doesn't explain anything about the force and Luke becoming Ben's master before everything went down. Also the Knights of Ren\\, where the heck are they. Anyways\\, go see it but don't you won't love it.","true":true}
