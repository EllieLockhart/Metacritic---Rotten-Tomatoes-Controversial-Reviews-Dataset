Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Disappointing story and a wasted opportunity to make good use of the one legendary character crowds wanted to see - Luke Skywalker. This movie left me with a very similar feeling I had after watching The Phantom Menace. All true Star Wars fans should feel robbed.","true":true}
