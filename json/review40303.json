Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"This is one of the absolute worst Star Wars movies to come out. If you thought the prequels were bad well hold on\\, cause this movie alone is worse than all of the prequels. The Force Awakens was one of my favorite Star Wars movies\\, and this movie just completely shits on everything that movie setup. This movie is an absolute disgrace.","true":true}
