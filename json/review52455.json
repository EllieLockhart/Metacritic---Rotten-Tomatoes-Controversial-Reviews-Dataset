Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great sequel to the last one but it's not perfect. There are some problems with the plot and some of the characters. But all of those are over looked because of how great of the story between Rey\\, Luke\\, and Kylo Ren. They make the movie so much better.","true":true}
