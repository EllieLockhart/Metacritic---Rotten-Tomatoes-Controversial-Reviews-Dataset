Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I absolutely love this movie.  While\\,it may be tough to place any Star Wars movie higher than ESB and ANH\\, The Last Jedi is up there with them.  It treats the old characters with a very serious degree of humanity and respect while pointing the franchise forward in a direction that we cannot fully predict.  It is just as real and gritty as Star Wars was in 1977\\, and it leaves the future of the franchise feeling as fresh and exciting as it did back in 77.\\n\\nIf TFA stared backwards and stood on the past\\, TLJ looks boldly forward\\, while hugging the past gently and lovingly.  Very excited about episode 9 and what comes next for Star Wars!","true":true}
