Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Don't pay to see this the Critics are paid off \\, Its full of holes and its all over the place and kiloren does not even look like a BAD GUY not scary and when he takes his mask off looks like a nerd. This is with out a doubt the worst Starwas ever.","true":true}
