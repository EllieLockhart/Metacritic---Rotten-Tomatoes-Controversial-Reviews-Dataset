Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"I was so upset that I literally made an account just to give this movie a bad review. The script was terrible. The acting was bad. I mean like cringe worthy bad. The director does not like Star Wars and it shows. I mean some moments where kind of cool with the special effects and all\\, but on man come on. I could have done better. I was in a state of shock. Like I could not have accepted the movie as real. Like it was not really happening. I think the only parallels between this movies series and the others is that JJ comes in and gives us an awesome movie (A New Hope)\\, Evil Rian Johnson comes in and gives us a piece of crap (Empire Strikes Back)\\, and\\, HOPEFULLY\\, JJ can come back and clean up Rian's mess (Return of the Jedi).","true":true}
