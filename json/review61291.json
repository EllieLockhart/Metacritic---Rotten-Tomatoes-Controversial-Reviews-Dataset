This game is not a 10\/10 more like a 5 or 6 out of 10 at best. The story goes in weird directions just to cater to some agenda like everyone else has been saying. I guess if you have enough influence and the ability to make any developer\/producerNo negative reviews from the critics too scared to write about it's flaws and get paid to give it a good rating and then keep their mouth shut.

I guess if you have enough influence and the ability to make any developer\/producer look negatively through the media if they are not open to marginalized groups of people then you can do anything. Thanks for forcing some kind of strong women\/Trans friendly story though a franchise that they knew would sell a lot even if there agenda was injected in the game. Can't make one from scratch huh? Imagine if the leaks didn't come out how much worse this would of been.  This story sacrifices the main story between Joel and Ellie for the sake of someone named Abby who no  one wanted or cared to see. You have betrayed your fans for the sake of A.S. and her agenda to force her narrative into already established franchises. What game is next? You going to try to replace God of War with someone else now? Metal Gear? Who else is on the chopping block?  All in all\\, the graphics and gameplay is great but the story is total trash dumpster fire and is all over the place. Don't expect to get what you want out of last of us 2 unless you wanted some girl to take over the story. The \\\"girl takeover story\\\" agenda is real. As for me\\, 0\/10 for a game that wasn't meant for fans but meant to please a certain group of people. Guess you guys have invade a franchise and change it for it sell  this ideology huh lol. What a joke.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
