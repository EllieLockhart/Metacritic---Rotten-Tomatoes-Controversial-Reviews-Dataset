Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"During my viewing of the last Jedi I kept looking for reasons this movie was good. I found none\\, what was built in The Force Awakens was torn down in this lackluster sequel. I could not invest in any of the characters whatsoever\\, poor writing\\, poor directing and poor editing. At the very least I thought I would be entertained and have a fun time. I did not and I actually fear for the future of Star Wars. If the franchise slows down or dies it will be because of The Last Jedi.","true":true}
