Don't get me wrong\\, you're allowed to make a depressing story and still have it be a good one\\, but this is definitely NOT the case. They butchered everything that got built in the past 7 years by a very passionate community just to subvert their expectations and get those few moments of shock\\, at the cost of murdering something so beloved by many. But on top of being so offensively unkind to long time fans\\, the game is also littered with awful writing\\, character interactions that make zero sense for a human\\, and honestly very boring sections of gameplay. When it comes to the \\\"sjw\\\" controversies\\, I believe that most people would agree in saying that representing LGBT+ people in a videogame isn't a problem (and also nothing new\\, if you played the first game). The real issue emerges when you do that\\, and use it as a scapegoat for all criticism\\, every negative opinion gets pushed aside without even thinking about it because \\\"they're just mad about the lgbt characters\\\".\r\rTechnically speaking this game looks and sounds fantastic\\, among the very best I've ever witnessed on a console. But all of that hard work gets completely ruined by some truly awful decision making by the writers of the story. And since this game isn't self contained\\, it sadly manages to affect my memories of the first game\\, which I have loved dearly since 2013.\r\rEverybody\\, new fans\\, long time fans\\, should absolutely avoid this game because it will only affect you negatively and I really wish I could've known this before buying it.\u2026 Expand","true":true}
