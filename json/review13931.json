Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"If you consider yourself a fan of the simple but powerful story telling of the original films.  The Last Jedi isn't for you.  If you enjoyed the narrative\\, originality\\, and world building of the prequels. Then The Last Jedi isn't for you.  If you value a tight script.  Then The Last Jedi isn't for you.  If you enjoy suspense and gripping action. Then The Last Jedi isn't for you.  In fact the only audience I can recommend The Last Jedi to are those critical reviewers who are simply looking for low hanging fruit.","true":true}
