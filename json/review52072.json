Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"A great movie! Exciting and not predictable! From the first viewing entered the number of the most loved! The problem of all the critics is that they do not want to let go of the past. This film is the bright future of the saga! Excellent!","true":true}
