Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"To me the movie was lackluster first it was 2 ships following each other until the others gas went out leia wasn't even used that much Luke wasn't Luke he was like obi wan here is a man who brought his father Darth freaking Vader back to the light only to kill his nephew where was the love at and holdo didn't make any sense I didn't care if she died because I didn't know anything about her but I did like rose but in all the movie was disappointing and hope that episode 9 is better","true":true}
