Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"man oh man this movie was terrible!!! they dropped the ball on this film. they destroyed luke\\, ray is basically given powers with out her even training\\, saber battles are lame.
