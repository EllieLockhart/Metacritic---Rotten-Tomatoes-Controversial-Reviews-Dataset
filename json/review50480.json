Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"1\/16th of Star... I'm guessing that those who have given half a star wish they thought to give what I did... The critics were pressured into giving fake positive reviews.\\nNothing is good about this film. \\nNothing. \\nBad story\\, stupid character decisions\\, waste of mark Hamill\\, idiotic comedy attempts\\, no suspense. Just a really bad mess that I wanted to walk out of. \\nI even paid to have those moving seats that just repeatedly kicked me in the back. A reminder of how stupid I was to pay for my wife & I to see this mess. \\nDon't believe a single positive review. When have you seen a super high reviewer rating contrasted by a abysmal real people rating.","true":true}
