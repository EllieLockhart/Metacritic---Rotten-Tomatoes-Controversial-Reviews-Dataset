Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"After all this time\\, Star Wars still has me guessing what will happen next. It can't be easy breathing life into this long established franchise\\, turning expectations around to keep the audience surprised and anticipating. The original trilogy will always be my favorite\\, but The Last Jedi is a close second for me. ","true":true}
