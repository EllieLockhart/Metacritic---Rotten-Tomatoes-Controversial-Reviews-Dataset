Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"What a total let down. I won't give you any spoilers in my opinion of this movie. Bottom line I think most hour long tv shows do a better job telling a story than this movie. Two years ago the Force Awakens left me excited wanting more. This episode was a total waste of time and money and I don't know anymore about the characters than I did two years ago. I read on a forum that Disney pays a company to write good reviews on their movies. Before I watched this I would not have believed it. My advice is if your on a budget or have anything to do (wash a car\\, clean your house\\, go grocery shopping) then do it and wait till this comes out on DVD. But if your like me and have loved all things Star Wars than go watch the movie and be prepared to be very angry.","true":true}
