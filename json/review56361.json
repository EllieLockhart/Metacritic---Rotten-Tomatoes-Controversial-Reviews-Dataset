Rey never really was trained but some how is very good with a light saber and using the force. Snoke was not explained at all\\, which was frustrating. The Finn and Rose subplot was boring. Only one light saber battle and that is the best part of Star Wars. I didn't think Carrie Fisher's performance was all that great. Good movie but I was expecting much more.":"Terrible movie.  The first two hours were boring - waiting for something to happen. The last 45 minutes - nothing happens. The characters were flat and one-dimensional.  Luke Skywalker was sad\\, tired\\, and undeveloped.  Yoda's appearance was weak.  You learn nothing new about Rey or Finn.    No major new characters or insights. A lot of weak subplots and even weaker fight scenes.   In the end\\, I did not care which is bad for the franchise. You can see the critics like it more than the fans.","true":true}
