72588,MSMPS4,2018-10-01,9,"Spoilers! After getting 100% two times\, I feel like I should start making a review._*Story/Characters*_: The Story is amazing and is a Spidey fan's dream. Even though there are some pacing issues like the Mary Jane missions. Doc Ock\, Spider-Man\, Miles Morales\, etc make this game an intriguing story nonetheless.In the beginning\, you are greeted with Peter's room in which it is a mess. He then gets a call of a major crime at Fisk Tower. This sets up to him putting on his suit and getting a note of eviction. This shows how Peter is just like any other person in real life and in his universe. He has to pay bills\, has to do his job\, etc. He takes down Fisk with some awesome gameplay sequences. Fisk says when being arrested he says this\, \""One Month! In one month you'd wish you had me back!\"" In which he is right. We then go to Doc Ock.Doc Ock is a very Interesting character and is one of the best characters in the game. The game shows a troubled man trying to live his dream of making something big that can revolutionize the world. Peter is his assistant and even in Doc's darkest times\, Peter is there with him. By the end of the game\, you feel a sense of urgency for him not to turn into the villain we all know and love. In the end\, you defeat Doc by taking off the control unit of his arms and then have an emotional confrontation with him. Doc wanted to be something else when Peter didn't and the only thing Peter could do was leave him.Mr. Negative/Martin Lee is a very intriguing character. His parents were *killed while Norman Osborn was experimenting on him. This leads to Martin developing a plan to make him \""suffer\"". He blows up the speech where Miles' dad gets killed by the bombing. Martin was a very kind man when you met him at F.E.A.S.T. He celebrated Aunt May's services at the place and made beds for homeless people. But there was always something wrong with him. He had this look in his eyes where you felt like he was planning something. Overall he was developed well and gave some great boss battles.Mary Jane: I liked Mary Jane at first but got very insecure about herself when you go into the game. I also didn't like the Mary Jane missions that much but I didn't mind it. I don't really have that much to say about her. She's just kind of an annoying\, insecure person. But I will say this\, the text scene with her and Peter was great and it's something that all of have confronted in life. She got better though by the end but I felt like Insomniac should not have gone this path of MJ.Miles Morales: Insomniac made me like Miles. They made me relate and feel bad for the guy. They developed his character so well and the stealth sequence with him and Rhino almost gave me a heart attack. My favorite scene with him was at his father's funeral where he basically shut down Peter. I loved how they didn't kill Peter when Miles get bit by the Spider too. I really can't wait how they're going to use him in the sequel.The story from beginning to end is a great experience. It has an abundance of great scenes like the crane scene\, the texting scene\, the Doc Ock confrontation (in the end)\, and sadly Aunt May passing away. This game's story is just a great piece of work.-------------------------Gameplay:The gameplay is fun and creative. It's related to Spider-Man 2 or Batman Arkham but it gets creative with the system. There are so many ways to beat up thugs\, you can web them up in the air and yank them down\, you can punch into the wall and them web them onto the wall\, you can knock them out with a f*cking drone. It's so much fun to play with and the QTE's do not do anything to draw back the system. You can skip the QTE's by going to the settings\, in which the QTE sections will just look like an epic movie action scenes. The puzzles are not really necessary but it does add to the variety. You can also use the skip button to skip the puzzles. I love it how they're not forcing you to do convoluted stuff. If you don't want to do the puzzle missions\, you can just skip them. Overall the gameplay get's inspiration from other games\, but it gets creative with it and makes it a whole lot of fun. And who can forget about the Web Swinging? The web swinging is the best traversal system in video game history (in my opinion). The swinging is very realistic and actually takes skill to web swing around beautiful New York City. It just never gets old\, I could probably web swing for an hour or so.---------------------VERDICT_*The Spectacular*_*Animations are fluid and fun*Story is an absolute treat to play and watch.*Gameplay is awesome and fun.*The Acting is superb*The Web Swinging is the greatest traversal system ever.*Some Side Missions are fun*The Graphics are absolutely stunning*Details are amazing-------------The problems*Stealth Sequences*Very few pacing issues*Little bit of MJToday I'm going to give Spider-Man PS4 a 9/10 or 93/100 if It would be a double-digit number.… Expand",true

62507,MSMPS4,2018-09-13,10,"Spider-Man has always been a huge influence in my life. One of them was he was the first superhero to get myself into gaming. I was 5 and the first 3-D Spider-Man game came out on the playstation. I remember the awesome times that I had playing that game like having no memory cards so that I'd have to leave the playstation on. Having the different outfits of Spider-Man peaked my interestSpider-Man has always been a huge influence in my life. One of them was he was the first superhero to get myself into gaming. I was 5 and the first 3-D Spider-Man game came out on the playstation. I remember the awesome times that I had playing that game like having no memory cards so that I'd have to leave the playstation on. Having the different outfits of Spider-Man peaked my interest as I kept playing. Using cheat codes like no other because I can. My love for gaming came from that\, so as the years go by\, I tried finding a Spider-Man game that could give me that feeling once again. Only  2 games from the last decade I could recall giving me that FEELING of Spider-Man. Spider-Man 2 on PS2 and Spider-Man Web of Shadows on PS3. Every other game felt so shallow in comparison because either they have one feature removed or it was washed down and broken. I'm a pretty optimistic kind of guy. I love Spider-Man so when I saw the announcement trailer for this game I was so excited. it looked like the Spider-Man game I always wanted. 3 years later\, the game is finally here and people are wondering if its a overhyped Playstation exclusive or does it actually reinvent the whole superhero genre?Story - The game is set 8 years in after Peter Parker became Spider-Man so no origin story\, no uncle ben's death scene\, no he/she expose my identity situation. It's all done and dealt with so what we get is a more characterized Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He's a college graduate\, working as a scientist\, his relationship with MJ is complex and questionable\, he sucks at paying his rent on time\, etc.  My whole journey with Peter felt nice and refreshing as we don't really get this type of characterization for him. You FEEL for him going through these troubled times because people can relate to some of them. He's not just a Superhero\, he's also one of us. That is why I think this adventure was amazing. Everyone felt fully utilize. You can feel or sense their intentions just by looking at them. Everyone actually has different motives and dreams to conquer. You have to play the story for yourself to really experience it.Graphics - My god this game looks fantastic. There wasn't a day when we thought Spider-Man would get this type of treatment. There is so much detail in this game that I was at awe most of the time. The details on every suit\, the pores and facial expressions\, the details of the world\, and character models.  Everything felt super smooth as I was playing through the game. Only 3 times the game started to dip in frame rate because a lot of stuff was happening at that moment. Most of the time\, I was just surprised how well the game ran. The only SuperHero games I played that looked as good as this was Batman Arkham Knight and Infamous Second Son.Gameplay - It has been awhile since I played a game that made me FEEL like I was Spider-Man. That's the whole point of this game though. It makes you FEEL like Spider-Man. Memes comments side\, the game actually plays really amazing. You have so much control on Spider-Man that nothing feels complicated or overbearing. You get just enough things to do and depending on the situation\, it's what you do that affects the outcome of the battle. People believe that you can just mash the attack button over and over again without thought but there is actually strategy in this. At the start\, of course that's mostly what you do but then it starts to add in a few small things at a time. So here are the basics. Square attacks\, Triangle Web-Strikes\, Circle is to dodge\, R1 is to shoot out web contraptions\, and L1 is to change those web contraptions. You get different enemy types with different variations on them. A few of them have different ways to be dealt with. As you progress through the game\, you'll be able to craft things like Suits\, Mods\, and New Gadgets. The suits gives you different mods that can help turn the tide during combat moments and what's cool is that the suit mod isn't restricted to just one. The player can mix/match what they want to wear and want to use. New gadgets actually have use for them except maybe one. You also get a couple mini-games that have circuit power through to another circuit or match up biomaterials to compose new things.They are fun and don't break up the gameplay. The main thing though about a Spider-Man game though is Swinging. I am happy to say that swinging in this game is freaking awesome. The feeling and weight behind every jump\, every web shot\, every swing just feels great. I can't describe how good it feels as you need to play it yourself to understand how good this swinging is. I remember just a few nights ago that for an hour all I did was swing back and forth. The only problems I had with the gameplay was sometimes the Dodge mechanic can be super finicky as it doesn't respond right away causing some annoying deathsOverall - Marvel Spider-Man is amazing.  If you have a PS4\, this is the game that should be included in your library… Expand",true

Taking down villians like Fisk\, Shocker\, Electro\, the Valture\, Dr. Octopus\, etc. may offer a slight challenge but with Spidey's  athletic style combat you'll manage. Since I brought it up\, let's talk about. The Combat seems Arkham inspired but it has it's own flow and it's actually very responsive and enjoyable. There also upgrades that can be unlocked towards Spidey gadget and different moves that you pull off as you progress. As far Graphics goes the game looks beautiful.

The combat could use a little bit more vareity in it's combination\, as well it's side missions. It does get boring taking out enimies the same way over and over\, especially when they're in waves. One other thing is the MJ stealth sections. I don't know if they wanted to show there was playable female character to shut feminists. But honestly I don't like it.

I know\, you're thinking that I might've got my console tucked into something or that it's badly ventilated or not cleaned or whatnot. It's not. Reviewers rarely comment on these things\, but there's that.I don't necessarily point on things as good or bad as a measurement on what score I'd consider Spiderman with. Let's just say this: when the story goes on\, it is really flipping good\, and when you're swinging around webbing stuff - you really do feel like you have great powers and great responsibility. But everyone else doesn't seem to have that much of any responsibility? Citizens of New York are kind of dull. Not much is going on other than traffic. There are side missions and tasks that are quite fun\, but it gets repetitive really quick.Spiderman is that game where you do stuff in order to unlock trophies. You could absolutely go for the Platinum trophy in this game\, just do everything fairly good. But you don't play it for too long\, because then it mostly feel like you're doing in-game chores. So my experience was really mixed. It's absolutely the best Spiderman game we've played and if you're a Marvel-fan it's a no-brain decision to get it.

I was skeptical since I read the comic books and watched the movie\, so how different could have been the game to make it exciting enough? Well\, i thought it was different enough\, but also mixed with what I already knew and I quite liked it.The controls were fun and quite easy to get a grip off\, which was good as there was a LOT of combat. i enjoyed it\, although I felt it was quite repetitive\, I lost energy after collecting all the landmarks\, backpacks and crime sites\, the research facilities had some variety but all the prison camps etc were just too similar. Go there\, fight a group of people\, that's it\, no big sense of purpose\, besides ticking it off the list. Although it's probably better that way than if players were forced to do that all. Also\, what's that thing about people locked in car boots? That was just odd.The game is very pretty and even tho it's an open world you could travel quickly swinging between the building and with the fast travel option. I loved different loading screens when traveling with the underground and how they corresponded to the gameflow.

And to think this game topped my other favorite game ever just a few weeks after I beat the other game (which happened to be Final Fantasy VII Remake)! It is a joy to experience\, and makes even the most mundane tasks a notable event.STORY:We follow a much more experienced Peter Parker; one who has been fighting crime for eight years. The game starts with a mission to finally take down Kingpin\, a major crime boss in New York. However\, once he is arrested and his organization starts being taken down\, a brand new organization with unknown motives move in\, and you have to figure out what they want/stop them for good.That is all I will get into\, since this game deserves to be discovered by itself. The story\, quite frankly\, is the best Spider-Man story to date. It is so full of little details\, twists and turns\, amazing character performances\, and emotional gut punches that really got to me. Round of applause to everyone involved\, you gave us something special. Not to mention Spidey is incredibly relatable and funny. He feels down to earth\, like you could get to know him. He's got plenty of quips\, and they all at the very least made me smile while playing.GRAPHICS/SOUNDThis game looks great. Environments are rich and detailed (with a few minor exceptions); it felt like a fully realized city with a lot in it. Character models and animations are very well done. There were a few times where the faces might look a little off\, but that's going to happen almost every time. That soundtrack\, man\, the soundtrack! It is utter bliss. Usage of the themes is also strategic; when you start swinging and picking up speed\, the music will swell\, giving an amazing feeling like none other. It can be comparable to going through a launch star in Mario Galaxy. The PS4 might not be powerful enough to render some things like reflections properly\, but it's not a big deal. They are coming out with a Remastered version of this game that should fix those small issues. Except for Peter's face\, they completely changed it (as of 9/30/2020\, if they change it back in the future that will be great)\, and it doesn't look right! Insomniac\, what have you done to my boy?GAMEPLAYHOO BOY\, THIS GAME CONTROLS LIKE A DREAM. Never before have I played a game where moving around the map is as fun as the rest of the game\, but Spider-Man does this with the greatest traversal system known to man: Spider-Man's webslinging. It even gets better when you start unlocking new abilities like the trick system\, the better zip-to-point launch\, the super jump\, IT'S ALL SO GOOD!There are also some side things to change up the pace\, like little science puzzles to play as Peter Parker in the lab\, which are neat. There are stealth sections\, catching pigeons\, waving to people in the city\, unlocking new suits and gadgets\, and of course\, the combat.Pure.Utter.Bliss.There are so many options in combat. You got your basic combos and such\, but you also got web gadgets\, you can web objects and swing them around\, you can knock them up in the air\, web them\, and swing them down to the ground\, You've got special suit abilities like the web blossom\, which will unleash a bunch of shots of web in all directions\, IT'S SO FUN.If you pay attention and don't just mindlessly button-mash\, you can get some huge combos going. The highest I ever achieved was around 107 hits. Pulling things off like that is a rush that only this game can provide.VERDICTThis game is a product of a group of people who are excited to put everything into this game; there is so much passion and love put into every single aspect that you have to respect this game at the very least. I am so excited to play Spider-Man: Miles Morales when it comes out.Insomniac\, thank you so much for this game. I love it so much.… Expand",true

I finally got my hands on it and I was entertained but nothing here was revolutionary for me. The single player campaign is good length. The main missions were definitely the highlight for me. These were AMAZING. All the chase sequences\, on-screen destruction\, animations were truly fantastic. I felt glued to the chair when spider-man jumped\, dodged obstacles and fired his web. When the game falls flat to me was outside main story missions.The city felt lifeless and little flat. New York looked amazing and city looked busy but the moment you landed on the ground the level of interactions was rather limited. This made city feel boring and flat to me. You have tons of activities but these really feel the same. I did not feel the need to do all of them. (I did most of the side activities and might come back to the game to do some more but they all come down to fighting waves of enemies or swinging through the city and collecting stuff). It is little bland when compared to the main campaign missions.The combat system is good so you might do most of all of the side activities. What makes it interesting are spidy gadgets which bring more variety to the combat mechanics. There is also light progression system which will help you unlock new/improved ways of annihilating your enemies and will bring more flow to the engagements.Traversing through the world is lots of fun\, there are lots of collectables and mini crime stopping activities which if completed will reward you with tokens that can be spent on upgrades and costumes. There are plenty of those.I played game on base ps4 model and 65 inch TV. It all looked very cinematic but graphic was not the next level like God Of War or RDR2 but it was definitly a good looking game. I wonder how it looks in 4k.I overall liked the game. I enjoyed Spider-man movie but by all means am not a die hard fan. For me it is solid 8/10 game.(if you are a fan it might be an 9 or maybe even a 10).Pros:- this Amazing campaign- lots of very interesting villains- combat sytem- voice acting- web slinging and gadgetsCons:- lacked of variaty- flat city deisgn- repetetive side activities… Expand",true

I also like how this isn't just another rehash of the origin story but takes place well after Spiderman has established himself as a hero. However\, the game itself is just not that great.Outside of the main storyline you have these side mission that are just cookie cutter filler and completely ripped of from every type of open world game out there. Outposts\, random crimes on the streets\, catching pigeons for some reason\, etc. Not too interesting. Also\, while the graphics are alright\, there is nothing exmplemplary in the environments. Just a bunch of cookie cutter boxed buildings with a few exceptions like Avengers HQ and the Daily Bugle. Compared to games like Arkham Knight\, the city is just bland to explore\, but I guess it's just New York.The combat just gets old very quickly and the most basic moves are really all you need to progress. It used the same tried and true formula created by the Batman Arkham series but really does not innovate. Difficulty rises simply because the game will throw numbers at you and you just need to manage the massive amounts of enemy types\, from basic thugs to Riflemen to shield toting guys\, etc. Each enemy has most efficient way of getting disposed but mostly you bash 2 buttons.The side missions are all just pretty meh as well although the main story is solid and there is a plethora of spidey suits you can don\, but unlocking some of them is a chore. Ultimately\, the game itself turns into a chore by the end and there just isn't enough diversity to the gameplay.

The story that really is some of the best even when compared to Spider-Man movies. Strangely showing in a video game\, sides of the characters that sometimes get lost in Hollywood movies.

To compare it to the Arkham games is unfair\, it's like comparing Bayonetta and Devil May Cry\, two games that are in the same genre but handle it entirely different. Where Batman\, wants to make you feel every individual punch you pull on an enemy\, Spider-Man focuses on having you zoom around the battlefield and slam your opponent from every angle.Story: The game has a really enjoyable plot filled with twists\, turns\, and intrigue. It gets reasonably emotional towards the end and that is where it feels like the writers are at their absolute best. The only problems I had were that the overall pace and interest of the story really dipped at the halfway mark and majority of the second act felt like a slog to play through when compared to the opening and closing segments.Gameplay: This is where the game gets a bit mixed for me. The overall game will last about 15-20 hours for normal players (30-35 for platnium players). The game is filled with a plethora of somewhat boring collectibles\, with the backpacks being great and everything else being meh. The game's side missions almost all suck with at least one downright terrible one (the streamer one) and the open world mostly feels lifeless and becomes boring to explore quickly. Thankfully\, the web-slinging system is so amazing it *almost* makes up for it. There are also these segments where you get to play as other characters important to the plot and they are often boring to play through\, which hurts my willingness to replay it.Characters: Every main character is genuinely interesting and most of them have some sort of tragedy. Mary-Jane has some slightly annoying moments but she is never unbearable. The only character I feel more mixed towards is Peter. His growth as a character and his overall story line is great and all\, but his damn quipping can get so freaking annoying. This is the same problem that Insomniac's previous game\, the terribly underrated Sunset Overdrive\, had. The game makes too many jokes and most of them don't land for me. But\, comedy is subjective I guess.Downloadable Content: Don't bother spending your money on it. Most of the missions are sub-par along with the suits. But\, if you really need a fix for more of the plot\, then you may get your money's worth.Overall Verdict: Game's highly enjoyable\, but after obtaining the platinum\, I can't find a reason for me to want to return to the game outside of playing the story sometime again in the future. The story deserves a full playthrough but the side content is only worth doing once for the trophies.Score: Mid to High 7… Expand",true

72250,MSMPS4,2020-08-05,8,"This game is exactly what the superhero industry needed to revitalize superhero games. With a gripping story\, great gameplay and graphics\, Marvel's Spider-Man might be what Iron Man was to the cinematic world.Starting off with the story\, it's the usual Spider-Man. Peter Parker is in college age and is already Spider-Man when the game starts and focuses on William Fisk\, Kingpin\, in the beginning. Combining the friendly neighborhood Spidey work\, Peter also works at FEAST with Aunt May and Martin Li. Everything takes a turn when Spider-Man catches Kingpin which unleashes a wave of uncontrolled criminality driven by Mister Negative and his chinese culprits\, the Demons\, as they try to dismantle Norman Osborn from his run to extend his Mayor post in New York.It all continues with an introduction of Miles Morales\, Doctor Octopus and the Sinister Six as it culminates into an epic battle of peace in New York\, which Peter has to solve while also maintaining his persona hidden and handling his new relationship with MJ.The story is great and epic and truly feels like a superhero story. However\, there are plenty of plot holes and badly explained parts which need background information to understand. While the climaxes are amazing\, the parts leading up to the climaxes can be lackluster. Certain characters would need fleshing out before introduction as well.The gameplay is in general great. You do feel like the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man as you swing through a huge New York solving minor crimes. However\, the game offers A LOT of optional side missions and tasks\, which in my taste is a bit too much. While it pushes the friendly neighborhood hero narrative\, it takes a way a lot of time from the main story. I would definitely prefer a more fleshed out main story than swinging through New York taking pictures or finding backpacks.The combat is very good with great gimmicks and amazing animations. It gets a bit repetetive as much of the combat is based on waves with fairly few different opponents\, but it's still good enough to take you through the game. The bosses however are mostly amazing with different mechanics and scenarios that truly feel epic.The graphics in the game are good. They're not the best of the generation\, but good enough. The characters feel alive enough with some good expressions. The game is a bit cartoony but that's fine in a game like Spider-Man\, as it's a comic book.One of the negatives is that there are quite a few loading screens in the game. While not really an issue\, it's more of how other games have evolved past loading screens. It suddenly feels quite unmodern with loading screens\, but it's not enough to really bring down the game.All in all\, Marvel's Spider-Man is a great game and for superhero fans\, it's a must play. The story is great at the peaks\, but would need some more fleshing out and fewer plot holes which could be fixed by reducing the number of side quests and focusing on the main story instead. The gameplay is good but as noted earlier\, is quite focused on the side questing which drags it down a bit. The combat is cool and superhero-like but could be fleshed out a bit more\, but the bosses and main antagonists definitely holds top\, top class.In the era of superhero domination in the cinematic world\, Marvel's Spider-Man is just right in time\, and it will be very interesting to see where Insomniac takes this in to the future.… Expand",true

The ability to switch between different powers on the fly would have made it much more great\, as constantly going into the menu to equip your powers depending on the situation does break from the immersion\,apart from that there is little to nothing wrong with it.If you are a spiderman fan or just like spiderman in general and have a ps4. you owe it to yourself to play this.

Games like Edge of Time\, Web of Shadows\, Shattered Dimensions\, they were all mediocre at best to me. Even with their positive features\, none of them clicked with me. The Amazing Spider-Man came out as a game to tie in with its movie\, and I just couldn't bear that game. It tried too much to be like the Batman Arkham games\, which were very successful due to how well they used their formula and with a very good and unique story. Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2 on the other hand\, had lackluster stories. I don't even think I completed TASM2 because I just couldn't stand revisiting that formula again after playing Arkham Knight\, which was FANTASTIC.It's been 4 years since the horrid Amazing Spider-Man 2. Once Marvel's Spider-Man was announced two years ago\, I had to admit I was impressed and gaining hype\, but I was beginning to doubt it. However\, once I saw the gameplay\, I was absolutely blown away. I knew this was the game we needed\, and I knew this was Insomniac's big break after the not-so-impressive Ratchet & Clank reboot. Much to how I expected\, this game turned out spectacular.The main theme alone\, once I started up the game for the first theme\, had wrecked my entire brain. It sounded like it belonged on the big screen in the MCU\, and it definitely was the perfect theme for our favorite quippy superhero.The story is pretty great\, it's definitely the kind you'd find in a Marvel movie or comic line\, and I never felt that the pace was broken or messed up in the entire playthrough. Never became slow and never moved too fast\, it was a perfect 20-22 hour ride.The gameplay itself is the big highlight. The game takes almost all of its foundation from the original Spider-Man 2 video game from Activision's times and refines it.The web swinging is top notch here\, even better than Spider-Man 2. You can do a variety of air tricks once you release the web\, like front and backflips\, spinning horizontally\, and you can rack up XP for doing these tricks\, as well as a trophy in particular. The swinging is fluid\, and it makes a return of sticking to buildings. Different moves can be done\, such as swinging into a building and running across it\, which while doing so you can press X to boost yourself up further. There's also web zipping to make your travels faster\, and a move you can unlock where once you hit the ground\, you can hit X and not lose the flow of the traversing and go flying in the air once again.Combat wise\, you've got the basic beat-em-up gameplay\, somewhat reminiscent of the Arkham games with the combo multiplier and the takedowns you can perform by pressing triangle and circle\, but the combat system will be very familiar if you played Spider-Man 2 back in the day. A new feature that wasn't seen in the original game is the addition of gadgets\, which seems to come from the Arkham Inspiration. There is a wide assortment of gadgets including web bombs\, electric webs\, concussion blasts\, drones\, and more. It helps the combat not become too simplistic and boring whenever you want a different style for fights. I found myself using trip mines\, web bombs\, and concussion blasts a lot\, which can be combined in different ways\, such as using a web bomb to trap someone in webs\, then concussion blast them into a wall and permanently disable them for the rest of the fight. There are also a large variety of suits to equip in this game\, each containing a unique suit power you can equip using any suit of your choice\, which also adds variety to your combat\, as well as suit powers that enhance your healing or give you electricity in certain situations\, and others. The combat is one of the best I've ever experienced in a video game\, period.There are so many more things you can do in this game\, like various side missions\, taking photos of landmarks\, and collecting backpacks to see important items from the history of Spidey himself\, but you should play it to discover all these things for yourself!Marvel's Spider-Man is one of the greatest games I've ever played in my entire life. It has easily climbed its way into my Top 5 games\, and I believe every human being should have an opportunity to witness our favorite webhead's peak in video games\, and the best superhero game of all time in my opinion. Insomniac has done a fantastic job\, and this is\, in my opinion\, their greatest game ever.Marvel's Spider-Man gets a 10/10\, a perfect score. Insomniac deserves it. I haven't been this hooked on a game in a while\, and I haven't felt so inspired to be like a hero before now. I can't wait for what's next in the fresh reboot of a spectacular franchise.

The other great announcement was that it was being developed by Insomniac Games who are responsible for great games like SunsetSpider Man was one of the most exciting announcements back in 2016 at E3. When looking at that game most people thought that this game would pretty much play like the Batman Arkham games except it would be faster given how Spider Man moves when he fights. The other great announcement was that it was being developed by Insomniac Games who are responsible for great games like Sunset Overdrive\, Ratchet and Clank\, and Spyro. So with great development team taking on a well established IP like Spider Man\, it’s difficult not to get excited about this game. And when the game finally came out and I got to finally experience the game for myself I was left extremely satisfied. This game is not only one of the best games of the year but\, this version of Spider Man is my favorite interpretation of Peter Parker and Spider Man.Looking at the story of this game\, Peter Parker has been Spider Man for some years\, the games starts with him going after Wilson Fisk. Before Spider Man can finish of Fisk\, Spider Man is warned that because he is sending Fisk to prison no one can protect the city from what is going to happen. And as you progress through the game you are introduced to the Demons and Mr. Negative. There is a lot that goes on during the story that helps make this one of the best if not the best adaptation of Spider Man in the world of entertainment. Without spoiling the story\, this game does a great job at not only showing us the Spider Man many grew up either reading about or watching shows and movies about him\, but this game also does what some of the movies really haven't done as well which is make you feel for both sides of the character. Peter Parker in this game is excellent\, there are many times during this game where you just feel for the guy\, and you see the difficulties he goes through because there is more of a priority on being Spider Man than his life as Peter Parker and because of that his life and relationship is affected by that job.The only thing that I had a problem with the story involves the villain of the game. Mr. Negative has the blueprints of a sympathetic villain at first but\, the game doesn’t really go in depth with that side of the character. There is one scene where you see a moment with Mr.Negative not liking that he is about to resort to a life of crime. In another scene later on in the game tries to help make him sympathetic\, I thought it was a little too late to add that layer because at that point I didn’t have that much of a connection to the character that it was only a moment saying \""damn that sucks for him\"" and that's it. There is another character introduced half way through the game that seemed like a fight was going to occur at some point and it never happens. There are other characters in the game that really left a great impression and I'm excited for when they show up in the eventual sequel to this game.The one thing that was evident when a lot of us saw the gameplay footage of Spider-Man was that this game basically looks like a faster version of the Arkham games. And after playing the game that is mostly true for the most part. The combat is quick and showcases the difference between Batman and Spider-Man. Batman was brutal in his fights you would see him break criminals bones before knocking them out. Spider Man drops quips as he is taking down criminals or if you want to make combat situations less stressful he can be stealth and when the moment is right you combat the remaining enemies. Another main difference I feel when comparing the Arkham games and this one is that in the Arkham games\, there were moments you are in a room filled with armed enemies it felt impossible clearing that room of enemies unless you use stealth. In Spider Man it felt like his speed is what helped make those situation less of an issue. So what was almost impossible to do in one game\, in this game you can clear a room and with style.Another great aspect of this game is exploring the world you are in. In Spider Man it feels great web swinging through Manhattan and the world is lively. If you wanted to interact with the people of Manhattan you can it may be minor like throwing finger guns at people like in Spider Man 3 only this did it better. Or if there is an active crime going on in the city\, you hear a police radio talking about a crime occurring near your area and like that you can stop a robbery\, help civilians in an accident\, look for a missing person\, ect.Spider-Man is easily one of the best games of the year and not only that but\, it’s also one of the best adaptations of Spider-Man. This is another great exclusive that can only be played on PS4 and if you didn’t have one before this game\, now  The gameplay is quick and the humor Spider-Man displays is another thing that helps enhance the experience. The small complaints I have for this game honestly excites me more for the sequel because I can easily see the next game being even greater.… Expand",true

By the time I'd finished the DLC\, I was beyond ready for it to end in spite of hardly touching its side-content. I had long-since zoned-out and been listening to podcasts while I played....It almost seems like a meme at this point but the combat 100% is derived from Batman Arkham. It offers enough changes and feels different enough to justify its existence but it is still derivative nonetheless. All-in-all\, it feels a lot faster and appropriately lets you zip between enemies\, giving it its own unique flavor. The stealth sections are here too and don't overstay their welcome but feel a little under-cooked. You also play as 2 other characters for a couple of sections but these are pretty groan-worthy\, shoehorning in scripted stealth sequences where you're not able to make choices in how you approach problems.While the combat is Arkham\, the overall structure leans more toward the Ubisoft-open-world model\, with map-towers\, crimes\, collectibles\, etc. If it resembles one of the Batmans in particular\, it would be Arkham Knight for this exact reason\, which most people had a more mixed response as a result. There's a million icons on your map and you could easily double your time if you engage with all of this stuff. It's tragically not that compelling though\, and the main quest and especially the DLC have a lot of this fluff in them as well. Spider-Man's bag of tricks runs out reasonably quickly\, turning it into a string of combat-enounters\, chase sequences\, cutscenes\, hacking minigames\, etc. It never dwells on anything too long but very few sequences in this game left a lasting impression. Thankfully\, around 2/3 of the way through\, NYC becomes overrun with crime and at this point\, the campaign and open-world become a lot more interesting but I couldn't help wishing this had happened much earlier in the game. This is something the Batman games did at the start of their games\, to great effect.The most disappointing thing about Spider-Man is its lackluster level design. Insomniac has crafted some of the best levels in gaming history with Spyro and Ratchet & Clank but here\, they've shackled themselves to a realistic map of NYC that just isn't very interesting to explore. In spite of how much the visuals and detail have been improved in this entry\, it's still no more interesting to explore than it was on the PS2. The real shame here is that the Arkham games actually have great level-design! In contriving various video-gamey settings like a city-turned-prison or snow-storm\, the Batman games were able to have settings that were more interesting to explore and better lent themselves to a video game. This drove me to do every sidequest and find every riddler trophy throughout the whole series. Spider-Man\, however\, just has a bunch of generic buildings and pedestrians walking around everywhere. Ironically\, the most interesting areas of the game are when it deviates from the open world and copies ideas outright from Batman with a great prison level and some dream levels that are a little to close to Batman for comfort.To sum up\, the combat is good but derivative\, the story is great\, the mission variety is lacking but improves toward the end\, and the side content and DLC fail to make compelling cases for their existences. To me\, it's the definition of solid but nothing special. It might seem like I've made too many comparisons to Batman but Spider-Man is absolutely shameless in the way it borrows ideas and much of the game's world and structure is objectively worse than how Arkham City handled things 7 years earlier. Spider-man PS4 is significant to me in that it's where Insomniac has gone from being a leader to a follower. It's a very good game\, especially if you're a Spider-fan but it fails to offer anything new or exceptional to gaming as a whole.… Expand",true

The game is simply wonderful. The plot renders the specific of Spidey very well. This is the same sneaky and funny guy we all knew from the comic line. Sinister Six really get handle! And my favourite Shocker is so fantastically designed! (very similiar to the Spidey PS2 game from 2004).Gameplay? Oh my god... It's simply stunning! When you tasting it you're thinking: Is that game really need anything else? It's so simply and juicy experience which makes everyone relief. Spidey is very agile thanks to we can make incredible things through the New York surroundings.Some whining about the side missions but c'mon people\, this is not RPG! It's action game! In it all meaning itself. Talks about them no one allude about perfectly implemented easter eggs which makes every fan of Marvel universe dizzy. There are plenty of them!Insomniac made a fair work in the optimization also. The diffrence between PS4 PRO and normal PS4 it's only the graphics. In the both version the game works smoth as well.I'm Spidey fan from a long\, long time and this game is crowning my life adventure through the Marvel best character in history.Thank you Insomniac ;)… Expand",true

I was actually surprised how fluent and smooth everything in the game. I did even try to make it drop the frame rate by swinging too far or just trying to do too many things at the same time like combat\, travel around\, fast travel\, upgrading\, changing costume etc. No visible problems at all.Second: no patches/updates and no need to depend on any network condition. This may seem obvious but yet again other games require frequent updates and network connectivity which can interrupt easily the gameplay.I have to say that this game is almost perfect. Having said that those bits of little problems I noticed could be only just personal preferences. For example I may dislike the difficulty options (in my case playing on hard seems to be like playing on normal) others may like the fact that the game is a bit easy in my opinion. They could have add an additional hard difficulty like Nightmare or Hard-core or something.However the Challenges will compensate for this once I go for all for this high scores.The graphics and the details are just excellent. Even on a standard PS4 and without 4K HDR options.If you reading this and hesitating to get it then I am here to say that Spider-Man worth every penny and paying full price is something I will never regret.For PS4 owners this is a must buy and pretty much a well-made masterpiece.… Expand",true

I had goosebumps not even 15 minutes into playing. Very few video games have ever achieved that in my experience. Here are a few specific things I loved about this game:The combat is fluid and fresh. You rarely seem to repeat the same sequence of moves. The unlockable moves and gadgets keep it fresh so you're always learning new ways to approach a group of enemies. Not to mention\, it's some of the best looking combat to date.Swinging: The way you get around is just awesome. Sometimes I'd just take a break from missions and just swing around for a bit\, letting the music swell. It beats driving around in GTA and riding around in RDR2 (and those are two of my favorite games of all time)The suits are freakin' sweet. Enough said.The game can be played at the pace you want. For me\, I enjoyed playing fast pace going borough borough knocking out all missions and challenges swiftly.The story is beautifully written and the cut scenes are terrific. You will feel a range of emotions throughout. JJJ's character is absurd and hilarious as well.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that even when playing on the hardest difficulty\, the game still doesn't present much of a challenge. If you're a gamer that prefers to get knocked down a few times before overcoming a difficult mission\, this is not the best game for that.

My only qualm is the framerate isn't 60fps but the graphics are still amazing and I was really impressed that all of the suits looked so good and appeared in the cutscenes.The meat of the game is the gameplay. The webswinging is amazing and something that we all anticipated with bated breath. I was worried they'd screw it up yet again but this is by far the best webswinging experience ever\, including being better than the fabled Spider-Man 2 on the PS2. This game really blows that one away in every aspect\, especially gameplay. I found the webswinging easy to pick up and fun to master\, providing plenty of versatility and options for traversing the city. Combat and web-based gadgets are also quite engaging\, varied and fun. One qualm I do however have is with the special power that each suit has. It's great that you can customise suits\, but I found that the Web Blossom technique outshadowed most other special powers by miles\, making a lot of them redundant.I was a tad disappointed at the suits we can unlock. There are quite a few but most of them I am unfamiliar with and I think most players would be expecting to see the Symbiote suit in there\, but it's not and a couple of the suits do look similar to it but it's one absence I did note.The story is the strangest part of the game\, and not necessarily in a bad way. The game is much slower paced for the first 60% or so and then rapidly intensifies towards the end. For the first half of the game you aren't really met with many super-villians but they become far more frequent in the latter half\, with Spider-Man sometimes taking on two at a time. Again this is not a bad thing as most of the villains will be familiar to even casual players\, making their attacks predictable\, but with two villains simultaneously this makes the encounters feel fresh and challenging. The only downside is some villains do not get as much exposure as they deserve\, and one villain in particular gets a bit too much exposure whom I had not even heard of before this game.To sum it up\, I bought the game for £45 on release day from HMV and it was well-worth the purchase in a year that has been a mixed bag of games. As the price goes down I'd definitely recommend it to even casual players as you don't need to know much about Spider-Man to get to grips with the game.… Expand",true

It feels good\, it looks good\, and the controls are as responsive as can be. You can tell that this Peter Parker has lots of experience. But also the progression or \""talent\"" tree brings interesting\, usefull abilities and perks to the table\, which I really enjoyed. The story was the likes of Spider Man 2. Just perfect. Characters I wanted to know more about\, characters I fell in love with. I wish this could play out in a movie format. It also left some questions unanswered that I can't WAIT to discover in a potential sequel.I'll try to keep this short since I don't get paid to review. But I would recommend this game to anyone that loves a great story\, or just wants a new amazing game in general. The ONLY nitpick I would have is that there are some characters other than Peter Parker the game forces you to control in small sections\, which I wasn't very fond of. But the positive of this game would overwhelm this small nitpick\, so to me it's still worthy a 10/10.PERFECT GAME!… Expand",true

72288,MSMPS4,2019-01-02,8,"Spider-Man is the type of game that makes it very clearly that the developer put a lot of thought into making. Insomniac has crafted the best Spider-Man to date. By bringing in Dan Slott\, the team at Insomniac has manged to create a story that feels like it is taken directly out of Spider-Man comic book. The story is near perfect\, although I find the choice to ditch Mr. Negative in the Third Act for assembling the Sinister Six to be unnecessary. The Sinister Six would have been better set up by this game and then become the main villains of the sequel. With already such great writing around the character of Martin Li\, I just wish that Insomniac had been a bit more patient with their storytelling\, but nevertheless the story that is in this game is the best Superhero story in a video game (even better than any plot from the Arkham series). Peter Parker's relationships with various characters are also very well written. Never before have I found myself caring so much about Aunt May or MJ.Combat is good and is just distinct enough when compared to the Arkham/Shadow series that it doesn't feel like Insomniac did a copy paste. Spider-Man has plenty of different types of webs to allow you to take down most goons in whichever way you see fit. However the game does suffer from a lack of enemy variation. There are two main  strategies when approaching enemies one being to simply punch them into the air and then hit them while no one can touch you or to dodge the enemies' attacks and then spam R1 to web them. By Hour 30\, the combat begins to feel a bit repetitive and there are no new enemy types introduced in the third act keeping combat the same for much of the game.Stealth is initially fun as it is a faster pace than to what is found in Metal Gear\, Assassin's Creed\, Arkham\, and Shadow games\, but by the end of the game stealth becomes extremely repetitive as there are only 2 takedown types and 3 or so viable stealth webs. Nevertheless\, the Spider-Man stealth sections are still spaced far enough away that they are fun to play especially to play aggressive.The game ultimately suffers in its open world aspect. While Insomniac's recreation of Manhattan is fantastic\, the side missions are very repetitive and despite 1 or 2 standouts basically revolve around going to X location and beating up a gang\, rinse and repeat. This is one of the few open world games where the story is 100% better than the side content. Swinging around NY feels great though and although it is cliche\, this game DOES make you feel like Spider-Man. Swinging controls will occasionally get frustrating\, but are for the most part solid.Overall Spider-Man is a fantastic game that offers roughly 30 hours of content with about half of that being the superb story and the other half repetitive and mostly lack luster side content. Spider-Man is still a fantastic game that I would recommend to any fan of action games or the character himself.… Expand",true

71973,MSMPS4,2020-07-20,10,"Spider-Man's traversal mechanics are the best and most fun method of getting from point A to B that I have EVER played. I felt as it being my favorite aspect of the game I had to get that out first. Alongside the thrilling web-slinging\, everything about Marvel's Spider-Man is truly amazing. I had a big-fat-dumb smile on my face throughout the entire time playing this masterpiece. The story and visuals feel as if they've been ripped right off the pages of a Spider-Man comic.

I've no problem with these characters but prefer them to stay in the background as playing as Spider-Man is so much of a thrill and fun\, that when you're thrown into the perspective of someone who isn't a superhero it kind of dims the momentum of the game.

The city looks amazing and feels quite alive\, the graphics are spectacular (even the puddles for all the idiots who got enraged by screenshots that clearly were taken during different times of day)\, and the controls and movement feel sooooo fluid. Web slinging around the city is so engaging and surprisingly nuanced with the different moves and web launches you can do. The best aspect for me\, however\, is the combat. It. Is. So. Much. Fun. Once you get used to it and unlock some new moves the combat is highly addictive! I have so much fun swinging around waiting to get a notification of any crime happening nearby and excitedly rush in to beat the crud out of the scumbags haha.I'd say the biggest flaw in the game is the typical open-world mechanics in place. ''Go here to reveal this section of the map''\, which in turn reveals a bunch of pretty generic missions and collect-a-thon type objectives\, some of which are pretty boring. Rinse and repeat. The Mary-Jane missions are also mind numbingly easy and beige. Thankfully the overall gameplay is fun enough that you actually end up doing them all just because the swinging and fighting are super addictive. The story is also surprisingly good with some actual emotional highs and lows that are really effective in making you feel connected to the world\, story and characters. The voice acting is a big part of this being true as it's mostly spot-on and convincing especially with the lifelike facial animations! Combine all of that with a pretty robust leveling system\, which includes the usual skill-tree type progression along with a large selection of different spidey suits\, each with their own unique ''ultimate'' power\, perk slots on those very same suits and various unlockeable gadgets and gizmos which can also be individually upgraded to increase damage or area of effect etc etc. All-in-all there's lots to sink your teeth into if the game pleases you!Verdict: This is a really fun open-world beat-em-up style game with super slick controls\, animations and visuals with a great story on top of it all.

That said\, Spider’s grand story is overshadowed by its less than stellar gameplay and tedious missions. The absence of a new game plus mode is inexcusable and lowers the game’s replayability. Spider is still worth buying\, however\, it’s not a match against Batman: Arkham City or even Arkham Asylum—which launched nearly a decade ago.  And that’s ironic since Spidey closely mimics Batman’s formula in numerous aspects. Spider-man is a better than average hero game\, but it’s safe and repetitive.Graphically\, Spider is decent. Video scenes are solid. Spidey’s animations and outfits are well-rendered.  Voice acting is on par with other AAA titles. Acrobating around NYC is smooth enough. The 30fps lock is disappointing tho. Spidey feels sluggish at times since his frantic movements don’t translate well at the substandard frame rate. In hectic moments\, frames will abruptly drop into the teens. Spidey is a spastic combatant\, and gameplay would’ve greatly benefited from 60fps. The developers should’ve included an option that downgrades graphics to boost frame rates.I don’t understand the frame lock. Compared to exclusives like Horizon:Zero Dawn and God of War\, Spider’s set pieces are unremarkable. The sandbox is large\, but buildings and assets are flat and nondescript. Except for landmarks\, everything looks the same\, and everything is impeccably pristine. There are no signs of wear and tear on structures which have stood for over 100 years. There’s no grime or rust. It’s a forgettable city that’s comprised of generic\, copied and pasted assets.The story starts strong\, but quickly stumbles over itself. It mimics Arkham Asylum’s plot. But the end result is uneven pacing\, a handful of boring missions\, and mostly uninteresting villains. Except for one\, villains play minor roles\, and encounters with them are formulaic: Dodge\, dodge\, QTE and then rinse\, repeat. They aren't menacing at all.Fatigue creeps in just after the midgame.  Tedious side missions are endlessly recycled.  Enemy bases are recycled as well. Enemies are samey\, just reskinned for each faction. Players don’t get to explore NYC’s underground\, slums\, or subways. Players who feel adequately upgraded may just want to focus on the story.Spider forces gamers to play as other characters in multiple “stealth” missions. These are boring\, on-rails missions that exist solely for plot exposition. They comprise roughly an hour or more of the 10 hour campaign. After zipping around as Spider-man\, these missions serve as a harsh reminder why such missions suck. Who wants to play as Mary Jane? Nobody.Spider’s world lacks dynamism. Despite one villain’s miles long rampage\, cranes tipping over\, and flying wrecking balls demolishing buildings\, nothing physically changes once missions end. Buildings are unscathed. Showing a cityscape crumbling apart at the seams would’ve instilled realism and urgency into the game. Characters refer to all the demolition happening around them\, but there’s no evidence of it anywhere except roaming gangs of baddies.Combat is passable\, but it lacks Arkham’s refinement. Locating grapple points in stealth is a perfect example. After a sneaky flying kick takedown\, Spidey can’t quickly zip away to other locations. Players must rotate the camera until it’s perfectly positioned on certain objects and hope grapple icons appear. Looking at objects isn’t enough tho. The crosshair has to be positioned at exact points on objects\, otherwise grapple icons don’t appear. Camera location\, distance to objects\, and object heights all affect this as well. A cumbersome\, inexact process. Targeting specific enemies for web attacks is just as awkward.Spider’s combat emphasizes gravity defying dodging and stunts. But the lack of aiming on certain moves and poor camera angles handicaps the hero. He will web pull enemies from out of frame although he’s looking directly at other ones. This leads to unavoidable damage. Performing multiple instant takedowns is problematic because enemies are occluded during the close up\, slowmo animations.Although Arkham's Batman moves slower than Spidey\, his moveset is precise and deliberate. Batman’s focus on brute force combat translates well ingame and provides players a greater sense of control. Gadget use in Batman fares better as well. Overall\, Spider’s combat is chaotic\, but not always in a good way.Spidey can only refill gadgets by performing enemy takedowns. Specific takedowns are required to refill each gadget. Players with slow reflexes will enter battles unprepared. Focusing on suit upgrades which mitigate damage is helpful.Spider-man isn’t a bad game\, but it needs a new game plus\, better set pieces\, a streamlined story\, and more polished combat. It doesn’t dethrone Arkham Batman as the king of the hill. One playthrough is enough for me.… Expand",true

Lots of potential\, but lacks for execution.Definitely best spider man game ever but still falls short of what it could have been\, so far would give strong 7 out of 10. People on the streets do acknowledge and interact with you on somewhat level\, but their faces do not move\, like lips and stuff 95% of the time\, it just some body animation and then you hear voice saying a line\, but their face almost never moves.Also if you run\, you pretty much run straight through people. Like non clip thing is on\, although they do seem to have \""pushed\"" animations\, but it somewhat activates too late\, once spider runs through them and it is really distracting considering u could not do it in the amazing spider man 2 game.Fighting combat is fun\, but straight up cloned from Batman Arkham Knight. Animals on the streets like squirrels run beside u and u can walk through them\, because they do not have any AI they just have random spawn and movement pattern....and again u can just non clip through them.I don't know... city feels somewhat best as it ever been\, but yeah.. if it was like GTA V style\, where npc's actually have their life...these are just generic npc's which spawn randomly and do not do anything\, like no purpose. They will shout for a taxi for as long as you going to wait for them to do something else.. but nah\, npc will just stand on its animation loop and will shout for taxi even tho taxi car is there standing beside him. Not only that... traffic.... it just gets stuck. Nobody is moving\, not even NPC's they just stand in the same spots. People stand beside road crossings and they do not do that. You can see low assets kicking in on cars\, like 10 m away from them. Lower polygon models and it is somehow distracting but yeah\, as much as city is animated and detailed it is as DEAD... And the lines of npc's do repeat even after 5 mins of standing stillStory is good tho\, swinging is fun. but anything else.. much potential maybe they needed another 2-3 months to polish things\, maybe they needed more hardware power... Idk\, but this is rather single linear game\, because open world feels like a sandbox without a sand in it.Spider himself also seems not to be interested into interacting with environment\, apart casual triangle button press beside npc's who come over u and say something like lets do selfie and after bumping into someone saying \""excuse me\"" or similar line. And even after giving high five or other **** npc's just keep standing and doing nothing they do not walk away or mind their own business.Traffic AI is bad too... i see cars stuck and not moving for minutes\, the traffic pattern seems to be very generic. You can stand in front of a car and block the way and the npc behind the wheel won't beep u or mimic or do anything. Yeah\, again.. much potential\, but open world is dead.I can only imagine the game which could have been if they would actually made some AI for npc's rather than focusing everything into the story which will leave you empty after the completion\, unless you want to do the repetitive collectibles and side missions.I paid 52 euros for the game and completed on PS4 Pro. Will sell it to store for 50 euros voucher\, so at the end game did not cost anything to me\, but it leaves somewhat disappointment feeling. Maybe too much hype after all this waiting.Graphics: 8/10 (has the watch dogs 2 vibe and feel with a mix of the crew 2\, but you can see popping and asset flipping to lower polygon models\, car models are quite repetitive and npc models are not topping GTA V NPC's (2013 game))Gameplay: 9/10 (for Spiderman) and 5/10 (for rest of the world)Story: 8/10 (feels like a decent hero movie\, nothing new you haven't seen)… Expand",true

I found the narrative to be engaging & the characters were interesting.My biggest complaint about the game is about its overworld\, exploration\, point a to point b stuff\, the in between action sequences. The web swinging is certainly a cool way to get around and I had fun with it for a while\, but the game does it mostly on autopilot and it gets a bit stale.Then there's the open world aspect to the game\, which I found to be somewhat lacking in depth & uniueness. Maybe I'm just played out on open world games in general\, but I found this one to be pretty run of the mill. I think a great open world game should encourage free exploration. Instead Spiderman uses the tower system where you find a tower\, press a button\, and the game shows you where all the interesting stuff is. Then you go to those places instead of truly exploring. You end up playing the game on the minimap. The interesting stuff includes landmarks\, collectables\, fights\, outposts\, mini side missions. Some of these were great\, some not so much\, and a lot of them felt like the same stuff you get out of every open world game.… Expand",true

Actually\, if it wasn't for the trophy that unlocks after you fast travel 5 times I might not even know it existed.The easy comparison is\, of course\, Batman Arkham City but allot lighter; in everything including the tone. But that's classic Marvel/DC comparison I suppose.The story focuses on an older but still maturing peter parker 8 years into his life as Spiderman. I found Peter this time around being more relatable\, seeing him trying to balance his social and Hero life to an unhealthy degree. So in short\, it's a Spiderman story threw and threw. Still very original and even has a few surprises\, but in some cases\, you can practically hear the dialogue 10 minutes before it happens.The combat while very similar to Arkham’s punch\, Counter\, take on large groups of enemies style of combat\, is faster and made crazy if you make use of the web attacks Spidy can use; to either hit the goons\, throw the goons\, threw objects at the goons or my personal favourite throwing the goons off a building top to grab them in mid-air to then throw them again.The open world did feel very Ubisoft in its set up. Case in point\, Bloody Radio Towers. Turn them on and watch the icons fly up for the usual: enemy outpost\, collectables and challenges. The map didn't feel too overbearing for me and I say the web swinging does help make the world feel less like a painful commute; in fact\, I felt the cruising through the game randomly stumbling across collectables and challenges was very peaceful. The missions and side quest are varied for the variety\, although why they put in the mandatory stealth missions with instant death is beyond me. Looking at all the activities as a whole the game did feel a little flabby. All the side stuff seemed to overshadow the main story somewhat. If the beating up goons part is what you're here for that's fine\, you'll never run out of them. I just felt the story fell short in compared to the rest of the game. I realise I'm underlying every sandbox game but I digress.Overall Disney's Marvel's Sony's Spider-man is an amazing game. Whether you just wanted a game to lose yourself for hours in or you waited for an interactive take on your friendly neighbourhood Spider-man; I know I did.… Expand",true

On one hand the traversal mechanics are so smooth that it's easy to find one's self thinking as if they're actually Spider-Man himself. I can spend (and have spent) copious amounts of time just swinging around Manhattan. Subway? What subway? Manhattan itself is stunningly beautiful. Colors pop\, the world feels alive\, small details (like AC unit fans) are present in abundance. The proper tie ins to the larger Marvel universe are there and do not feel shoehorned in. The city functions as a character of its own.On the other hand\, what the game offers is just your bog-standard open world collect-a-thon fare. The map is littered with collections\, almost as bad as the map of London from Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Towers to climb (err\, hack)\, backpacks to find\, research stations to complete\, landmarks to photograph\, pigeons to gather\, Black Cat locations to scout\, Fisk and Demon bases to plunder\, thug and Demon crimes to stop\, the list goes on. Like the aforementioned Assassin's Creed franchise\, only a handful of these tie into the actual story\, most are just there to pad overall playtime and are incidental only to the location or a specific character -- essentially there to do just because you're the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. And that's fine to a point\, but it becomes tiresome after a while just like every other collect-a-thon open world game. Keep in mind that Ubisoft pioneered this format of open world game and with the latest iterations of their franchises they've fundamentally changed and/or toned down the litter-the-world-with-collectables formula because it was wearing thin on players.The combat is merely \""ok\"". It's your standard combo button beat-em-up with webslinging/aerial maneuvers interspersed throughout. It's similar to the Batman Arkham series but a bit more frenetic. Stealth is less important than the Batman series but still very useful. If you're rusty with the old combo button/Arkham combat mechanics\, it will take a bit to reacquaint yourself but once you unlock a few skills and a couple of suits combat generally becomes easy except on the hardest difficulty setting where the AI just become gods of combat.All in all it's worth playing but I just don't see it being an 9 or 10 game. It's the same open world\, combo brawler design that we've all burned out on since late last generation. Beyond its city traversal method and great attention to detail on the cityscape itself\, the game doesn't really bring anything new to the genre.… Expand",true

This is as close as you can get to feeling like the Amazing Spiderman. There's a true sense of speed and momentum you get while swinging through the streets of New York. It's only amplified by the fantastic musical score that starts as soon as you leap into the air and begin slinging webs. This personally\, is my favorite aspect of the game. Every animation is graceful and fluid\, and it can become a very fun skill to master.The combat is equally impactful and gratifying. Spidey can leap\, and dodge very similar to the Arkham Knight series. But nothing feels outplayed or repetitive. The combat can be very challenging also. Jumping in the fray with 10+ enemies can prove to be very risky\, and takes a keen reaction to your Spider-Senses to stay alive. Spidey can only take limited hits\, and isn't a huge punching bag like Bruce Wayne can be. This satisfying difficulty is managed by the amount of gadgets you have at your disposal. The gadgets include everything from regular webs\, to automated combat assisted spider drones. It all fits very well to the universe\, and everything has a sense of believability to it.I haven't completed the main story yet\, as there's no limit to the fun you can have when just running around New York\, collecting backpacks\, saving civilians\, and fighting petty crime. But through the amount of story I've experience\, everything seems top notch. The voice acting is great\, with maybe a few line \""hic-ups\"" here and there\, but nothing that will ever make you cringe. You feel a real sense of connection to Peter Parker and his life situations\, as Pete is always portrayed as a simple guy trying to make ends meet.  He suffers with relationships problems\, the same as modern day people would\, through texts and social media for example. Every character is unique\, and leaves you wanting to find out more to their own personal story.I couldn't have dreamed of a better Spider-Man gaming experience. Insomniac poured every ounce of love and respect into one of the most beloved super heroes of all time. If you're a gamer\, comic\, Marvel\, and especially a Spider-Man fan\, you owe it to yourself to buy this game. You will not be disappointed.Excelsior!… Expand",true

You feel New York. Peter Parker as a character was awesome. Playing with him usually contains some puzzles but that's no problem\, i heard MJ parts was boring but I disagree\, I think stealth sessions was a good way to balance the tempo. By the way I loved the Insomniacs take on both of these characters. MJ makes great as a Journalist and personally better than being an actress. This improves her relation with Spidey greatly.Combat\, aside from amazing traversal\, combat is also amazing\, an important part is it allows you to make strategic decision\, you can take enemies out with multiple ways with those large amount of gadgets and of course your trusted web shooters\, hands and legs too... the amount of combinations you can do is limitless\, and the combos too. The finishers in the game really makes the fight alot interesting\, there is large amount of finisher animations in the game and it is amazing I would say the feeling of hits isn't that great but when you pull these amazing combos and finishers you don't desperately need it\, your eyes just lock to the screen. From the last sentence you might think that the combat is easy\, it's definitely not the case. Don't think I'm spider-man these punks can't to anything to me. These guys really push you\, they don't wait until you beat the other guys then strike\, they just fight you with all they got. You may find yourself trying to escape a never ending sequence of gun shooting\, rockets and more. And you will deal with it with your abilities and things i listed above.Side Activities and Collectibles\, there is plenty of them. I can say they are original and creative but one negative thing i'm going to say because they are plenty\, if you try to finish all of these before finishing the game\, it can drive you away from the story a little.A thing I'm a little disappointed about is boss fights\, they are fun and all but they all have a pattern and when you know what to do\, the rest is doing the same thing again and again until you beat them.There are certainly alot left to say but my hands are slowly getting tired =) After all it was definitely worth the hype and overall a great game\, an awesome game\, an amazing game\, a spectacular game\, best super hero game yet.

I have recently been playing games like 2K19\, GTA V\, and Battlefront\, so getting to play a game like this was a nice refresher from the mass online multiplayer games which are normally more my style. Spiderman PS4 is an extremely immersive game. Aside from the engrossing narrative is an excellent set of web swinging mechanics\, which  combined with fun gadgets and plenty of puns\, makes for great action in both the more open missions and in the quiet\, confined corridors of tense sequences. The mechanics are truly great in this game\, it is incredibly addicting to just swing around the city of New York for hours and with the combat system\, there is a way to make each encounter with criminals unique. I probably can’t explain how many times I got goosebumps just from either watching Spiderman perform some spectacular feat or performing it myself\, and the ending is so emotionally powerful it would make even non-marvel fans tear up. As far as pricing goes it is the same as pretty much any other current game at $50-$60\, without deals or discounts applied\, however I think that this game is worth it just because the sheer quality of content and the experience that you will get while playing. The deluxe version of this game is priced at $80\, but before you get disgusted it includes three DLC chapters. These aren’t just random side missions and fillers they are all full stories almost like three additional games for just $30 extra.

The Developers Insomniac set out to not only write a well-written video game story\, but it’s also quite apparent that their goal was to write a well written Spider-Man and Peter Parker story.  It’s an interesting as you have Spider-Man at his peak\, he is hitting onGame GenreThird PersonAction-AdventureOpen WorldStoryOne of the strongest aspects of this game is the story. The Developers Insomniac set out to not only write a well-written video game story\, but it’s also quite apparent that their goal was to write a well written Spider-Man and Peter Parker story.  It’s an interesting as you have Spider-Man at his peak\, he is hitting on all cylinders but then you have Peter Parker where every aspect of his life is falling apart.Favorite CharacterIt’s a Spider-Man game so its hard not to pick Spider-Man. I love his little quips and his jokes\, there is just something so charming about Spider-Man.PuzzlesThis is hands down the worst aspect of the game\, there are two types of “puzzles” and they’re both terrible. Luckily there is a setting in the game options that you can skip all puzzles. That way when you’re narratively forced to engage with one of the “puzzles”  you can hit the “R1” button and the game instantly solves them.GameplayThere are two major aspects to the gameplay. The traversal through the world (web swinging) and the combat.The swinging is extremely satisfying and just works flawlessly. The way you seamlessly swing through the city and then hit a building and instead of losing momentum\, you just switch gears and start running the building. Some of the buildings will have fire escapes on the outside and that’s doesn’t slow you down either. You just start hopping along the fire escapes.  A lot of thought went into the mobility of the game and it shows.The other major aspect is\, as I said the combat which is reminiscent of Arkham franchise but it is different enough. One of the key differences is\, in Arkham you’re much more grounded where in this game\, you definitely want to focus on more aerial combos. It’s not difficult to do so but its very important to pop an enemy up in the air and try to knock them out in the air.BossesThere were a grand total of 7 Boss battles in the game and they were all for the most part well done. There is one boss that you end up fighting twice\, the first you fight him\, it’s not much more than a quick time event boss battle. Although the second time you fight the boss\, it is much better and I think it may be my favorite boss in the game. Looking back\, all of the boss battles did feel different and that’s what you really want in a video game.Mission/Level DesignThere are 3 keys that I want to touch upon in this section. The main story missions\, the Miles/MJ missions\, and the side missions.Main Missions: These were all fantastic with the exception of a few that I will touch upon in the next part. The main story of the game is maybe 20 hours and Insomniac did a fantastic job with the Main Story missions\, it doesn’t feel like you’re rehashing the same missions over and over again.The Miles Morales/MJ\, however\, are just awful. They are forced stealth and they’re bad stealth in my opinion. What I define as bad stealth is stealth that if you’re ever caught\, you lose instantly. Missions that are structured this way just lead to frustration and never fun. Luckily\, these missions are not too common and there is maybe 6 of them\, which equates to about 45 minutes to an hour.The third type is side missions and there is an inconsistency with them. Some are good but most are okay.

My only complaint is that the streets are filled with too few types of video game people.The story itself is an epic thrill ride with a truly cinematic ending. If you really want to enjoy the story\, play the Friendly Neighborhood mode and forget about having to unlock everything. Otherwise be ready to take down bases and perform challenges to upgrade your gear. I would say that most of the gear can be bypassed\, and maybe only 1/2 the challenges need to be completed before the final boss fights. The completionist that I am\, I finished all side quests before advancing the story. Because I love the gameplay\, I loved playing all of the repetitive content. I feel like a hypocrite because I tired of Ubisoft's open world bases long ago and lambasted Arkham Knight for it's overuse of bases. Maybe I'm inherently biased toward Spider-Man. Maybe its the limited nature of the bases and lack of padding that makes other games a slog to play. Assuming you don't die and restart too often\, the game is a tight experience.Without hesitation\, I label this game a must play. You will love it. I guarantee it.… Expand",true

73170,MSMPS4,2020-02-26,9,"I had extremely high hopes for this game\, and I'm pleased to say Insomniac Games have either met or exceeded every one of my expectations. While there is some room for improvement\, Marvel's Spider-man is a fantastic game\, one of the best of the generation in fact. More importantly\, it rivals the Arkham games for the title of best superhero game\, and more importantly still\, it ranks alongside Spider-man 2\, Into the Spider-Verse and the Spectacular Spider-man as one of the best takes on the character both within and outside the comics.I expected stellar graphics and gameplay\, and that's exactly what I got. It runs beautifully\, the game world looks gorgeous\, and the impressive facial capture really adds life to cutscenes. The web-swinging is easily the most fun and visually impressive to date\, and the combat is deep and open to experimentation\, with a nice degree of enemy variety. Stealth is a bit basic\, but is still satisfying. Wall-crawling is a bit awkward though\, and it would have been nice to have had a bit more in the way of deep\, story based side content that makes the most of Spider-man's rich history and mythology\, but most of what's here is still fun regardless.What I didn't expect was how great the story and characters would be. Insomniac have delivered one of the all time great Spider-man stories in any medium in my opinion\, managing the near impossible task of creating something that honours the past while also feeling new and fresh. This game features some of my favourite versions of Peter\, MJ and [SPOILERS] Doc Ock. It's even one of only two pieces of Spider-man media to make me like and care about Miles Morales\, a character I've been lukewarm on in the comics. Additionally\, the love the developers have for the source material is obvious\, with an obscene number of references and easter eggs to Spider-man and the wider Marvel Universe tucked away for discovery. There are some flaws: certain characters feel like they don't get enough screen time\, and others feel a bit schizophrenically written in order to wrap up the plot. These are minor flaws however\, and I applaud the Insomniac team for their amazing work in this field.To sum up\, if you're a fan of Spider-man\, superheroes\, or just games in general\, this is a must play. Thank you Insomniac for the amazing experience and all your hard work. Can't wait for the sequel!… Expand",true

This game does almost everything right and is engaging from beginning to end. The opening moments of this game are memorable because of the graphical fidelity and the amazing feel of swinging around New York. The combat starts off simple enough where you can learn the basics without feeling overwhelmed and only expands from there. As you learn more moves the combat becomes more satisfying (especially when you learn how to pull enemies up to you and throw them down at another enemy). The gadgets are also very well done and can help turn the tide of a battle. Each gadget is unique and serves a purpose in a fight. Another great aspect of the combat is you can't simply button mash. There are a varied number of enemy types and many will kill you if you simply mash the attack button. Learning how to counter them so you can attack is important and also satisfying. One aspect of the game that isn't perfect is the open world collectables. These very from collecting Peter Parkers backbacks that he lost in High School\, chasing down Pigeons for a homeless man\, taking pictures of landmarks (which is actually fun)\, and more. I actually enjoyed these collectables (because I'm a trophy hunter) but many people may feel like this is tedious work. Luckily the web swinging feels amazing and getting from one place to another is also exciting and never gets old. There is a fast travel system will the subway but I very rarely used it because why would you? The world is beautiful and exploring it is even better. When you aren't swinging around you can walk around New York and see how realistic the population is. From people reacting to you\, to actual street laws. The detail put into civilian life is simply amazing because you won't notice it 99% of the time. The different suits are also amazing and offer unique abilities which you can attach to your favorite suit. Finally\, the main story is well done and engaging but not revolutionary. The way Insomniac created this original story that isn't based off any comic or film is worth mentioning. Seeing a character in a new light is always welcomed and I enjoyed that very much. The acting and motion capture is top notch and help elevate the story and writing. Once the story gets going you won't want to put the controller down. There are also a handful of side quests which are good but not necessary. There is one side quest that offers some unique gameplay but a majority of them are the same.

The story here is truly amazing and the writing displays the quality seen in an MCU movie. The writers really outdid themselves\, and I wasn't expecting it to be that good. The gameplay is fluid and responsive and does what you intended to do most of the times. The combat\, though it's nothing original\, it's what they did with the pre existing formula that makes it unique. The combat has variety and it only increases as you unlock skills. The web slinging is an absolute blast and never gets old even for the 3000th time. And you will spend a lot of time swinging in this game. The story missions are very well structured and all of them have different ambiance to them. MJ stealth sections were also fun since they provided a change of pace and gave us a different POV.  Side missions do tend to get repetitive but that doesn't matter when the mechanics are so damn good. The open world is a well realized version of Manhatten with the amount of detail that can compete with that of Gta5. The visuals are hands down unreal as expected from sony's first party games.  This game has a lot of quality content\, and it would be a crime for the ps4 gamers as well as spidey fans to miss on this masterpiece.… Expand",true

This is where Insomniacs entry will break the mold. Anybody who claims this is not a spectacular entry is likely far up their own anal cavity.That said - there are a couple nagging issues that while they do not hamper the overall enjoyment\, may be worth noting before taking to the streets as the man of many webs.1. Combat: Now this isn't an issue with the way combat looks - it's gorgeous and fluent and I love every second. However\, the game over-explains many of the combat features early in the game\, and does little to reinforce them after\, causing a bit of confusion as you quickly encounter large groups of mixed classes. Furthermore\, even when combat shines the brightest there is an inherent feeling of \""I didn't mean to do that but it looked cool!\""\, basically like you have less control over Spidey then I'd personally like. To compare to Batman\, where eventually you could play the timing game so well you'd never be touched (even without gadgets) - to reach that level with Spidey you'll have to become reliant on using gadgets frequently\, and more or less smashing the dodge button.2. Sound: I love the sound\, but the problem is the game handles ambient and voice work poorly in many areas\, with ambient noise popping in suddenly and loudly\, drowning out dialogue. Or that dialogue is so baby soft during the loudest scripted events. Fortunately there are a couple audio options even on console that may help you even this out. All in all sound is incredible\, the game just handles volume poorly on the basic setting.Overall the game is magnificent\, few times have I played with such a wide grin on my face the entire time. Insomniac did an amazing job of making the city feel alive\, and making your part in the ecosystem feel natural and fluid. This is where it succeeds in spades over the Arkham franchise\, because while I love those games too I always felt like I was \""playing Batman well\""\, not \""I am Batman\"" as so many would cry.I........am Spider-Man. 8/10… Expand",true

If I'm not mistaken\, the game is called \""Marvel's Spider-Man\"". So why am I forced to play as Mary Jane and that other guy in some sections of the game?

The way Insomniac crafted this game shows how passionate and dedicated the studio was to these characters and universe.The gameplay is very engaging. Even when you are doing nothing\, it is insanely fun to swing around the New York skyscrapers. The controls are fun to use and in hard-mode\, it provides a fun and stimulating experience. The combat and skill tree were very interesting and had a lot of abilities that changed the gameplay quite a bit\, providing new experiences even towards the end of the game. This is one of those games that take advantage of the full immersion of the PS4 and does not become repetitive.The story and city of New York are loyal to the comics and all iterations of Spidey. At points\, It felt a lot like playing a movie\, especially with how great the cutscenes and writing were. Speaking of movies\, I absolutely loved using the Tom Holland suits\, although if you are more of a fan of another interpretation of Spider-Man\, there is probably an option for that. I loved that they included dozens of cosmetic options for Spidey. Letting you craft you own story to a certain extent.I think the demon storyline goes on for way too long. I was expecting more of a focus on classic Spidey villains. That is why I thought the second half of the game was perfect. Battling the Sinister Six is everything I ever wanted from a Spider-Man experience. I thought that this interpretation of the classic characters was very well done. This includes secondaries such as Mary Jane\, Aunt May\, Miles Morales among others. There were all likeable and leave you wanting to see more of them.The DLCs are 100% worth it. They are a great expansion that continues the main story from the game. Contrary to most game DLCs\, they do not feel like filler\, the characters are expanded upon and transformed in very drastic ways. I even thought at points that The City That Never Sleeps storyline was even better than the main game's story. Silver Sable and Black Cat have become two of my favorite characters. Although I wish to see more of them in a sequel\, the Spider-Man universe is so big that I can't wait to see what new heroes and villains Insomniac studios introduces in the future.This game did an amazing job with Peter Parker's story. It leaves so much space for future stories\, while having a clean conclusion on its own. I can't wait to be a part of this universe again when the Miles Morales game drops later this year.… Expand",true

Maybe it's because it's been years since we had the last Spider-Man game\, or maybe it's because this game is more polished than previousIt's kind of funny how previous spider-man games got ripped on for doing the same thing as previous spider-man games or for copying Arkham games or for their lack of innovation\, when this game pretty much does the exact same thing but get's away with it.  Maybe it's because it's been years since we had the last Spider-Man game\, or maybe it's because this game is more polished than previous ones\, even though it's still not perfectly polished.  There are bugs\, and they are annoying but for some reason THIS one gets a pass.  Well\, not by me it doesn't.Let me start by saying this game is good\, no doubt.  The story is great\, the gameplay\, while taking some getting used to\, is also great\, the animations are great\, the graphics are great but some parts are just repetitive and there are game breaking bugs that do indeed break missions and force you to start over.  Best example\, when a guy you NEED to defeat is stuck in a wall and unreachable forces you to fail and restart a mission.  This has happened a few times for me on my first playthrough.  The missions are also repetitive\, giving you little incentive to actually want to complete them.  In fact\, after you're done with the main story there's really not much else to do asides random crimes\, which are all \""Beat up bad guys\"" or \""Save one or two people\"".  Yes\, there are challenges but for the love of god they suck so bad.  The racing drone one's in particular suck so much\, because the web swinging is completely random as to how it reacts to where you are.  One moment\, it will react perfectly the way you want then the next it will latch onto a building you weren't expecting and completely F you up on your challenge forcing you to restart\, and these challenges are NOT easy and you NEED the tokens to unlock suits & gadgets which is even worse.  The only way to unlock everything is to get the Gold rank on most of these challenges\, which pretty much made me quit doing them.  Then there's the other tokens\, which are themselves also annoying to grind.  You need crime tokens to buy gear & suits as well\, and while they are easily available and unlimited to earn they are also tedious to earn making fighting crimes feel like a chore you need to do to get an allowance.  That's not to say it's not fun fighting crimes\, but it does get repetitive and repetitive always leads to boredom after a while.Then there's Mary Jane Watson\, who used to be a character I liked.  A strong woman who stood by her man but also took no **** from him\, I hate her now... She's become one of the worst women in Spider-man.  Fricking Silver Sable is a better character than MJ now\, and SS is as shallow a character as you can get.  Also\, I don't like playing as MJ or Miles in the forced stealth missions.  Not to say their work isn't useful\, but it is unnecessary.  Miles going into gang infested territory to get some antibiotics or MJ risking her life to ... be a reporter?  Wasn't that supposed to be Parker's job?  What the hell happened to her acting career?  Whatever...  Black cat makes a cameo in the form of finding her cat statues\, and until the DLC comes out she's not really in the game.  Then there's the detective lady\, who I can't remember her name...  She's the drollest character in the story\, a dull uninspired police-woman who's just there to give Spider-man direction through the plot.  \""Go get fisk\, fix these towers\, go get me groceries.\""  That last one's a joke\, but you get the point.  She's a useless character.The boss fights in the game are really fun\, tho\, with the exception being the first one against Mr. Negative.  It was just a bland QTE boss fight\, but the next one is awesome.  Fighting 2 bosses at once in the air while webslinging\, dodging moves\, counter attacking\, zipping around.  Yea\, that was really good.  And the last boss fight was great as well\, the one between those two was just okay.  I think overall the fighting in the game is probably the best & most polished part about it.  Attack with one button\, web attack with another\, dodge with another.  It takes getting used to but once you get used to it oh man can you flow like a beast.  Getting combos upwards of 80 or higher\, in a fight against waves of enemies can be some of the most fun you'll ever have in this game.  They really need to make an endless mode where you just fight enemies in an arena or something like that\, cause whenever it ended I was always in the mood for more.Overall\, the game is good but it's not done what previous games haven't done before.  It's just much more polished in it's execution of what they've done before.  Using background object to attack enemies\, Amazing Spider-man did it.  Level up system?  Amazing Spider-man did it.  Open world collectables & web swinging?  Every game after 2 did it.  The main difference tho is that Insomniac perfected what previous games did\, and that's what makes this one the best Spider-man game ever made.… Expand",true

With that out of the way\, the main reason being it just does everything with such a degree of skill and it has huge attention to detail to it that’ll make anyone who even is remotely a fan of the source material or action games want to check it out.The graphics are beautiful. Everything has a great look to it. Even buildings have small details\, such as windows where you can see what’s inside the windows. This level of detail goes throughout the entire game. If you own a PS4 pro\, the HDR effect is great and it looks beautiful on a good 4k TV with HDR. The game only runs at a locked 30 FPS but that’s fine\, it doesn’t drop frames\, at least anything that I’ve noticed and it’s very smooth as a result. The fast-paced action looks great\, though while I would’ve loved a 60 FPS mode\, the decision to keep it 30 might be for the best since everything just looks great. Even the NPC’s all look different enough to not feel like they just copy and pasted five models.The combat is very much different from the Arkham games. While the skeleton of that type of game is apparent\, it is more vertical and exhilarating. The combat due to the nature that is Spiderman’s character is very fast paced. The combat is challenging and even on the ‘easy’ mode\, it feels challenging. You can’t really mess up that much and healing is linked to combos it can be challenging to stay alive\, especially if you made a few mistakes. Thankfully\, checkpoints are very generous.It’s not perfect though\, it has these forced stealth sections and puzzles. The puzzles aren’t that bad\, if you take too much time to do them\, you can skip most of them but the stealth sections don’t have this luxury. Thankfully\, these sections aren’t that long and are over pretty quickly and are not that challenging but it feels out of place. Don’t get me wrong\, it’s nice to have variety but the game could’ve been better without them. It has them to try and show different points of view\, yet in a game about Spiderman\, that’s all I really wanted to play as.It’s not a dealbreaker though. If anything\, it’s just a minor annoyance and while an update that would give you an option to skip them would be the best thing ever\, I’ve seen much worse. They felt out of place\, unfortunately. The puzzles\, are not that bad though and like I said\, most can be skipped if you’re just not good at them\, which is nice. They can be challenging and for those who like that kind of stuff\, there is plenty to do.The game’s campaign is about 15 hours long. There are side missions that most are enjoyable\, some felt like filler but I enjoyed most of the side missions. There are also different things you can do like a typical open world game. If you really wanted to do everything\, you could easily spend 40-50 hours with this. There are also RPG elements. I like RPG’s so I didn’t mind them and I liked the progression\, with getting stronger\, faster and having more move sets.  It’s not a full on action RPG but there are bits and pieces that make it feel like one at times.The story is good. It feels like you’re playing through a new Spiderman Trilogy. There are three acts. The first act is interesting enough\, gives a proper introduction to the threat going on. The second act gets a bit repetitive and just when you feel the game might be getting a bit predictable\, it throws a great plot twist and throws you into the third act. The third act is nothing short of fantastic and exciting. The third act truly does make up for a rather slow second act and fully worth the investment to get through it.So with that being said\, despite its small pacing issues and the forced stealth sections\, it’s still an amazing game well worth the money. Of course\, these issues\, if they were not there or corrected would’ve made this easily a 10/10 in my eyes\, despite that\, I give it the highest 9/10 I can.It’s truly fantastic and everyone should play it. Unless you hate Marvel or something.… Expand",true

Казалось бы\, реализуйте полёты по городу таким образом\, чтобы просто перемещаться из точки А в точку Б без раздражения\, но инсомниак проработали эту механикунастолько хорошо\, что временами вы просто будете летать по городу с целью....а без какой-либо цели\, просто так\, потому что это круто\, это захватывает дух\, это лучше\, чем сесть на спорткар в ГТА 5 и укатить в закат.

И если стелс в исполнении паучка ещё может доставить (есть особое удовольствие в подвешивании целой группы противников на паутине к потолку)\, то когда разработчики принуждают стелсить другими персонажами из окружения Питера Паркера\, то это удручает\, и эти уровни хотелось быстрее пропустить\, чтобы вернуться к зрелищным боям и полётам в исполнении паука. Что касаемо головоломок\, то они очень легки и быстро приедаются\, надо было внести больше разнообразия и подредактировать баланс.Также отдельно стоит сказать об устройстве Open-World в этой игре. Склеен он по методичке Ubisoft\, даже злополучные вышки присутствуют\, за наличие которых можно было сразу убрать несколько баллов в финальной оценке\, НО\, благодаря приятнейшей механике полётов и динамичным быстрым перемещениям\, даже эти вышки не ломают фан от игр и не занимают много времени (хотя лучше бы их вообще не было). Плюс отдельно стоит упомянуть\, что любые активности в этой игре интереснее и разнообразнее сайд-квестов от той же юбисофт\, чего только стоят задания  сумасшедшего бригадира или квесты научных станций.Сюжет на удивление неплох\, хоть я и не фанат комиксов\, за его развитием было интересно следить\, а режиссура и постановка в кат-сценах не уступает лучшим образцам этого поколения.

It has been hailed for its gameplay\, story\, and visuals alike\, and while I don’t think it’s perfect\, it’s one of the best games I’ve played on the Ps4.First off\, the gameplay. The fighting mechanics are very interesting\, and work in Spider-man’s distinct abilities in interesting ways\, like swinging the enemies at each other using his web shooters\, and placing laser activated trip mines to remotely attach opponents to walls. While this is all very good\, I might have liked to see some more generic fighting techniques. That sounds kind of ridiculous seeing as how it’s a Spider-Man game and not “Joe Generic Takes on the Mob”\, but I noticed that without using his webs\, Peter seems a bit underpowered\, and while his uppercut move seems great\, it can typically only be comboed into web attacks after the original sequence\, and it would have been nice to see some ground combos. Spider-Man is supposed to be a genetic based hero\, and when he uses his tech more often than his genetic abilities in combat\, it makes him seem like more of a tech based one. One thing that Insomniac nailed is the web swinging though. Some people may prefer the swinging in Spider-Man 2\, which I have never played so I can’t entirely have a stance there\, but it seems incredible in this game. There are many different types of missions in Spider-Man Ps4\, ranging from air duct stealth\, to taking on waves of enemies\, to catching pigeons for your homeless friend\, and while I greatly enjoyed these missions\, both main story related and not\, some of the side missions seemed repetitive. It was fun collecting the first seven backpacks\, but by the ninety fourth I started to feel a bit annoyed. This doesn’t really affect your experience if you just want to play the story\, especially if you’re on easy mode\, (I was on normal difficulty) because most side missions only upgrade your stats and tech\, so if you’re playing on an easy difficulty it still wont be too hard to complete the story without them.And let me talk about that story because woah. This is the first time that I was really invested in a video games story since I was in second grade playing Zelda on my DS. Don’t get me wrong\, I pay attention to the stories\, but typically I don’t care too much what happens to the characters. Not for this one though\, it had me storming out of my living room and yelling “NO!” at the TV\, which is\, in my opinion\, perfection. I don’t want to talk about it too much because I might get into spoiler territory but let me just say that if you’re a spider-man fanboy\, this is gonna be good.And finally\, I’d like to talk about the visuals\, because this game makes New York look better than it did when I went there in real life. I found myself going to the tops of the tallest buildings just to get a better look at the scenery around me. This isn’t by any means groundbreaking\, I mean\, the graphics in Red Dead Redemption 2 are probably better\, but it is quality enough to notice\, and that’s quite good.So in conclusion\, Spider-Man Ps4 isn’t perfect\, but it proves that modern marvel games aren’t regulated to fighting game spin-offs\, and mobile games that you play for a few days\, and if you own a PlayStation four\, this is 100% a must play title. My consences is a 9.3 out of 10.… Expand",true

Super heroes have been no exception to this idea\, as every big Marvel and DC super hero who has been given a video game\, besides Batman\, has been treated horribly by what their developers create. But Insomniac has finally done away with this trend and created one of the most impressive licensed titles to date.\""Marvel's Spider-Man\"" is essentially a reimagining of the 2002 game developed by Treyarch\, and throws Spiderman into the open world of Manhattan Island (New York City). As an open world game\, Spider-Man succeeds immensely in creating both the feel and scenery of real-world New York City. The world includes enemy bases to reclaim\, landmarks to discover\, interesting side-quests\, and research stations that involve restoring New York to a better state. All of these elements add up to create a fantastic open-world that is both fun to explore and beautiful to look at.As far as the story goes\, its a really great attempt at creating a brand new story about Peter Parker and his secret life as Spiderman. Though\, if you are familiar with the Spider-Man Universe\, don't expect to see many surprises\, as the majority of the common Spiderman characters are written very similarly to their traditional roots. Thankfully\, this does not take away from how well-written and memorable the story is\, with the main highlights being the tragedy of Martin Li and the relationship between Dr. Octavius and Peter Parker. I won't spoil exactly what happens\, but I will say that it will be something you'll never forget\, whether you are a fan of Spiderman or not.One of the most impressive elements of this game (and probably my favorite of all) is how fluent and overall fun its gameplay is. I can't tell you how many times I got lost in roaming the city to just swing around and enjoy the scenery while pulling off as many tricks as possible. In addition\, the combat system is top notch and only gets even better and deeper as the game progresses\, and the number of ways you can go about knocking out enemies (throwing them off buildings\, sticking them to walls\, silently knocking them out\, etc.) only helped to enhance the experience. Unfortunately\, this game does have its shortcomings\, the biggest one being how repetitive the side missions can feel after awhile\, as all of the enemy base camps play out the exact same way and collecting all the backpacks isn't all that fun. Also\, even though I love the combat system\, it can get kind of boring and frustrating at times.In conclusion. \""Marvels Spider-Man\"" is a fantastic game\, both as an open-world game and a licensed product. It may not go above and beyond and is not quite a masterpiece\, but the sheer amount of enjoyment and satisfaction I got out of playing this game made it well-worth every penny I spent on it. I can't wait to see what Insomniac has in store for the future and I really hope this game ends up ushering in a new era of quality licensed video games.… Expand",true

Traversing as Spider-man is both exhilarating and intuitive\, which seems like it should be impossible to provide\, however they have cracked it. Exploration becomes incredibly rewarding due to the nature of swinging through New York being the reward itself. For this reason I haven't made it very far through the story (which has been great so far)\, because I have just been collecting all the collectables.The collectables have been done in a very satisfying way. Each type is introduced after beating a main mission. This means that (for example) there are only 55 collectables on the map in the beginning (backpacks with tokens and cool nods to Spidey's past and relationships). Every single collectable is available for collection\, there are no restrictions that waste time. Then after beating the next mission a completely different type of collectable is available\, for example photographing all of the landmarks\, getting three stars in Wilson Fisk hideout battles or completing research missions. This bite size nature of adding a new collectable as you play through makes the game enticing to consider platinum-ing.Combat: The combat in Spider-man has many highs and a few lows. Combat feels smooth and challenging\, rewarding your diversity in moves. I am playing on the harder difficulty and in almost all cases where I have died it has been my own fault and fair. I think the challenge presented in the hard mode is perfect and wish all games offered this balanced\, fair level of difficulty. The only complaint I have is that the brutes feel a little un-balanced on the harder setting. They can only be hit while they are webbed and they do huge damage\, so if there is ever two of them in one fight\, then isolating one and dealing with it becomes very frustrating as they take roughly 25 hits to go down\, meaning you need to dodge and avoid damage while webbing and combo-ing it roughly 5-6 times\, while dodging the other one. bearing in mind that they can kill you in two hits\, it can get a bit panicky and button mashy. I love how this game wires itself into your nervous system the way a fighter game does\, so when all of that deliberate fluid tactical combat and goes out the window\, it feels slightly cheap.Graphics: Graphics is a tough one to talk about\, as they are both incredible and at times lacklustre. The world and environments are so stunning that you could forgive someone for comparing this game Vs a cinematic liner single player title. However\, we need to remember that this game is actually a large open world with thousands of NPCs\, and because of this demanding nature\, the NPCs cannot all have the fidelity of Nathan Drake from uncharted. The witcher 3 was the same\, where it had really detailed main characters and important NPCs\, but every villager had the same bowl-cut hair and face. I personally don't think it detracts from the game at all\, but in the current climate of gaming\, I know people are going to be \""outraged\"".I thoroughly recommend this game to anyone\, people with arthritis should avoid this game however\, as it really is taxing on the thumbs.… Expand",true

I guess let's start from the top.The web swinging is better than it's ever been\, even better than Spider-Man Web Of Shadows or Spider-Man 2. You will never get bored of this web swinging because it's so fluid\, fast\, and dynamic\, you've never been given more control in a Spider-Man game I promise you.The graphics are incredible for an open world game and in my opinion it's the graphics on console to date. God Of War looked fantastic but New York and Spidey have never looked better and you will be mesmerized when swinging around the city and noticing every little detail. FPS never was an issue in the slightest and if anyone says downgrade they  need to get their eyes checked immediately.Combat is possibly it's greatest strength\, there has never been such a free will combat system. Much like Batman Arkham series you have total control over your gadgets and move sets\, however this game takes it to another level with combo possibilities with your move sets and gadgets that it can be overwhelming in a great way because you're like \""Dang I messed that up but man that was AWESOME!\"". I have found myself in awe of things I am able to do as a long time fan BUT there has never been a more accessible game for newcomers to Spider-Man games.The open world is alive and ever changing\, you could be swinging around and see a crime happen\, or you could be walking on the ground with citizens and one motions for you to come interact with them or you could be ambushed out of nowhere by some thugs and citizens will either love you or despise you just like it should be. There are tons of collectibles and side activities and even a Assassin's Creed-esque tower system but it's actually done in a great way and all in all the open world will keep you busy long after the credits rollThe story is engaging and heart felt and Yuri Lowenthal in my opinion is the best Spidey we've ever had! He's so funny and says nerdy things and has cheesy but sometimes awesome one liners\, the man is simply Spider-Man from here on in Spider-Man games until someone surpasses him but that's a massive uphill climb guys. The characters in the story Peter interacts with are all unique and wonderfully voice acted and kudos to the Mo-Cappers because this is truly a cinematic marvel.Finally.. let's talk about the suits and upgrades right? Well it's a little breathtaking\, there are many many suits to collect and many upgrades to enhance them with and Spider-Man's upgrade tree makes him simply a terror for the criminals of New York and I love that. You can quickly change suits in just a few seconds and even transfer the unique powers of one suit to another if you so wish to and I love the freedom of that.In conclusion this is the best Spider-Man game ever made and arguably (Though not for me because I believe it is) the greatest Superhero game ever made. Insomniac has done what many thought was impossible and that is make the Spider-Man game we deserve with all the weight of the movies and all the charm of Peter Parker while capturing the tension and heartbreak that plagues Peter all the time.. but I can say with certainty that it is a journey you must take to experience what it's like to be the hero that in Captain America's own words says is \""The best out of all of us\"".… Expand",true

Eu nunca vi um só filme\, jogo ou animação que pudesse compreender tão bem o personagem e representar ele nessa história espetacular que honra o que Stan Lee e Steve Ditko fizeram ao criar o Homem-Aranha.Se você já adorou o começo do game\, vai amar ainda mais o desenrolar da história\, e o surpreendente final. Mas o gake não se trata só de história\, mas também da gameplay. O combate\, baseado na série Arkham\, mas alterado aos moldes da Insomniac pra se encaixar ao Homem-Aranha em si. Com sua movimentação rápida\, fluída\, aérea e\, principalmente\, baseada no improviso\, e essa última característica que faz o combate desse jogo único e um rival do estilo implementando pelos jogos do Batman. Nos Arkham por exemplo\, quando você se deparava com um inimigo blindado\, você tinha opções limitadas de derrotá-lo\, que sempre apelavam pra no máximo três opções. No Homem-Aranha\, apesar da variedade de inimigos e de suas imunidades\, devido a quantidade de gadgets e opções\, há inúmeros jeitos de imobilizar até os inimigos de maneiras muito interessantes e criativas. Seja jogando ele de uma beirada\, socando-os pra cima\, os enchendo de teia no ar\, e puxando pra baixo (o que colaria eles no chão)\, jogando inimigos em cima de outros\, jogando seus foguetes ou granadas de volta\, finalizações aéreas\, chutes balançando... Essa foi uma primeira tentativa de combate da Insomniac que conseguiu reinventar a fórmula Arkham e tornar ainda mais dinâmico que seu inspirador\, além de ser mais desafiante\, pois você vai encontrar muito mais inimigos armados em combate  e sua resistência a balas é extremamente menor que a do Batman nos games.O stealth\, mais rápido e agora com mais opções de distração que o stealth dos jogos predecessores (TASM 1 e 2 da Activision e Beenox)\, ainda não está no nível Arkham\, porém ele consegue ser extremamente rápido e silencioso graças as habilidades do Teioso. A interação com cenário e as suas ferramentas deixam tudo mais fluido e interessante de se ver\, além das animações de neutralização furtiva muito bem feitas e criativas.O melhor \""web-slinging\"" já criado num jogo do Aranha. Desafiante de se aprender\, mas quando você masteriza ele\, simplesmente tudo ocorre de forma tão bela e fluída que até da gosto de passar muito tempo só se balançando pela cidade\, misturando com seu parkour em prédios que deixa tudo mais prazeroso. É rápido e funcional\, como nenhum outro game do Cabeça de Teia.28 trajes alternativos\, 95% deles com uma habilidade única que você pode mesclar em outros trajes\, como habilitar o ataque em área de efeito de guitarra do Aranha-Punk no traje Homemade. Além de permitir até 3 mods de armadura dente mais de 20 pra você ter vantagens no que você quiser\, seja ofensivo\, defensivo\, movimentação e utilitários.Uma porrada de referências do começo ao fim do jogo\, muitas delas de muito aparentes até bem secretas e que só encontramos dando um zoom com o Modo Foto. Quase sempre com um comentário engraçado do Peter pra você rir um pouco.Mundo vivo\, Nova York recriada quase em perfeição\, interação com o mundo\, pessoas e cenário. Iluminação e gráficos com um nível de cair o queixo. Missões secundárias e coletaveis bem legais pra você descobrir vilões únicos\, novos tipos de inimigos\, mais da  história da cidade e do Peter. Podcast do nosso amado JJJ sempre falando dos acontecimentos do jogo e culpando o amigão da vizinhança.Falando sério\, modéstia à parte\, como um dos maiores fãs do Homem-Aranha e como um viciado em videogames e coleta de platinas\, esse é o game definitivo do herói. A maior obra dele em muito tempo que me deixa extremamente hypado pela sequência. Se você é fã também e tá em dúvida em comprar\, não fique em dúvida\, eu te prometo uma experiência incrível.Obrigado Insomniac e Sony por trazer meu sonho de ter finalmente um jogo que honre esse personagem que todos amamos. Vocês trouxeram o definivo Teioso\, o superior Cabeça de Teia\, o realmente Espetacular Homem-Aranha.… Expand",false

So I have a comprehensive experience on it.This unfortunately is being run by a hype machine\, it's nowhere near the 90s people are giving it and over rates the game and misleads people to where it's at.The obvious good points are the visuals are great\, along with the web traversal\, it's intuitive and very smooth. You will rarely ever swing into a building and donk yourself against it\, losing all the momentum you've built up. (although that should be a given in a spider-man game).I liked a lot of details like the little tweet section and JJ podcasts that adds a layer of immersion to the world. The interiors on buildings that you're crawling past despite eventually being copy paste still managed to impress me because of the effort of city detail when they could have just put mirrored windows onThe core story is very short\, and the padding as Mary Jane/Miles Moral can be extremely tedious when you just want to get to being spiderman and I ended up just speed running as them and finding not a lot of issues in recklessly running around as them.The bosses themselves are waaaaay to easy\, Their patterns you figure out within 15 seconds because they're that repetitive. And you just end up rinse/repeating that strategy until the cutscene arrives which can feel a bit of a chore not a engaging challenge to over come.The story lingers a lot on Martin Lee\, like\, a lot. A good 66% of the game is about stopping him so the sinister 6 thing feels a little rushed because you only get one mission boss fight with them each and then they're gone. Made them kinda disposable characters for some of spidermans main villains.Most of those are legit criticisms but not worthy of bringing it down three points...but my biggest gripe? The side missions/side quests. The most mundane rinse and repeat fetch quests/time trials/\""map reveal\"" watchtower clichés that we have seen time and time and time again in open world games. They're getting so repetitive in the genre that I'm already bored of them the first time I ever played them in the game because I've already done it a million times before.The set crime response missions were pretty good\, but they need to make it more organic. Kind of like a radiant system with a wide plethora of missions. All the way from stopping bank heists to helping old ladies cats out of trees. Bring back the friendly neighborhood spider-man.I feel like it's a good start for spider-man\, but insomniac weren't trying to make an amazing game rather than a decent one to make the set up for a sequel that REALLY has potential. (symbiotes\, which I was kinda disappointment didn't make an appearance here.)Also\, PLEASE devs\, PLEASE. Make villains unlockable characters to play again like when the first sam raimi spiderman game let me play as the green goblin\, or how ultimate Spiderman let me play venom.Do you realise how god damn cool it is to play as those characters\, or doc ock?

72635,MSMPS4,2018-09-17,6,"MAJOR SPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING AHEAD!I was originally gonna write a long and boring review about the game but I thought might as well just write a few of my points here. I was a Spider-Man fan since I was a kid playing the PSX title and watching the animated series on TV back when it still aired\, my point being I love everything Spider-Man.When Insomniac announced they were developing the game I was thrilled\, and now that I got to play it\, I think Insomniac has done a lot of great work. Such as:Great graphics despite the ps4 being relatively weakCombat is super fluid and fun\, the swinging is top notch tooRPG elements and simple skill treesSuits that were never before seen in other SM gamesGood writing in Act 1 and 2\, the beggining of the game is fun and doesn’t include uncle BenGood camera mode\, I never really use it but when I tried it was fun and uniqueCity looks amazing and vibrant while you’re swinging.Obviously the list goes on as a lot of the game is done right\, but I also feel like the game has rocky parts that are almost left unaddressed\, such as:Arc 3 feels super rushed. The writing goes from being good to cliche/surface level lines such as “you don’t know me” “this is what we do\, we save the world” “I trusted you” “you were my hero” “I never stopped caring” bla bla. I just feel like the ending had no weight whatsoever.Silver Sable is extremely underdeveloped as a character (similarity to Nadine in Uncharted 4)Marry Jane is being toxic\, and despite this she gets back together with Peter and claims that \""she never stopped caring\"" haha like what?? The ending is obviously pure fan service in response to the “One More Day” arc in the comics\, which it didn’t even have to be considering none of this had even happened in this games universe\, by now we have already agreed that it was a horrible choice to reset SM like that\, why base the ending on that? Peter doesn’t deserve being in a relationship with someone as irresponsible and selfish as this universes MJ just because the plot demands it. There was a chance to do something unique here\, maybe show that Peter has matured and realized that this was not a good idea for either her or him.Research Stations try to force me to care about not only Harry whom we only see post credits but also his dead mom whom I’ve never even seen in anything SM and smoke clouds around NY.You get a taste of what side missions were supposed to be like (tombstone) but since development probably had to be rushed they ended up being “go beat up these corrupt students four times” (extremely repetitive)City feels as dead as it did in the past few games. If you stand still in one area you notice that cars don’t move\, NPC don’t have animated mouths\, they mostly just freeze up and you hear lines thrown at you from both channels.Last but not least\, non existing boss battles. The last battle came kind of close but as soon as you die you reload almost right where you died on all of them.I wrote this post because I’m very passionate about both SM and this game\, and I truly feel Insomniac is the best studio to handle SM games\, but I also write it because this game has been getting so many 10/10 reviews as well as praise which I don’t think it deserves. Ultimately this game was a strong 6/10 for me\, meaning it was enjoyable and mostly good\, just not great. I’m looking forward to their next SM title! Sorry for the long post guys!… Expand",true
72636,MSMPS4,2018-09-12,7,"Spider-Man arrives after a long hiatus but whilst the visuals are clearly up to the standards we expect from gaming in this era\, the game-play itself is very generic and dare I say\, last gen.Spider-Man is not 'new' to being the 'superhero' so we don't get yet another origin story. However\, Spider-Man still has to unlock the map using towers that many Ubisoft Open World games did in theSpider-Man arrives after a long hiatus but whilst the visuals are clearly up to the standards we expect from gaming in this era\, the game-play itself is very generic and dare I say\, last gen.Spider-Man is not 'new' to being the 'superhero' so we don't get yet another origin story. However\, Spider-Man still has to unlock the map using towers that many Ubisoft Open World games did in the past. For someone that has been Spider-Man in New York for years\, its disappointing to see that Spider-Man doesn't know New York until he unlocks the towers. Combat is rip off of Batman Arkham games - albeit with a bit more verticality thanks to the more athletic Spider-Man but I do think its less responsive too. There are some great animations in combat but these have to play out before you can do the next move. This can be frustrating as after a dodge\, there is a pause before Spider-man can 'move' again which makes the controls feel unresponsive at times. Sometimes Combat feels great\, at other times it feels frustrating\, sluggish\, unresponsive and for a 'super' hero\, known for his strength - which we do see at times (like lifting up cars or collapsed concrete beams)\, he feels remarkably weak in combat where it can take a few punches to be killed yet some basic goons will take a lot of Spider-Mans attacks to knock them down. Not great when swarmed by 3 or more and dodging leaves you vulnerable to a hit before you can resume your attack.On the ground\, Spiderman feels very sluggish\, not very athletic at all in running. Swinging can feel great when it works but again\, there are times when the controls don't seem very responsive. Wall crawling is slow and running up buildings often can seem erratic too. Spider-Man can't climb metal towers either despite the fact that they are like 'ladders' that normal humans wouldn't struggle climbing.The open World is well realised but despite being more populated by 'civilians' and vehicles\, something the Arkham games weren't\, its not particularly interesting (other than visually). The activities and Side Quests are mundane and more filler than anything else. You do have the 'bases' with waves of enemies\, random 'crimes' that are repeated in different areas\, places of interest to photograph and back-packs to collect. These are not exactly 'skippable' either as you need these to upgrade gadgets and craft suits - how a photograph/backpack helps here\, I don't know. Its all just filler\, repetitive and/or mundane.I won't go into the story to avoid spoilers but there are a lot of scripted elements and a number of QTE's too. You can't come up with your own strategy to beat a boss for example and often rely on dodging until a certain window of opportunity instructs you to use your webs to jam up or swing a heavy object at the boss and repeat until you move to a different phase.I know this sounds 'negative' overall but its not all bad. Its very much an 'old' (last gen) game in its format\, its game-play and open world but with a quite impressive current gen visual. Its not very innovative and has a lot of aspects that other games get 'criticised' for today - just look at Ubisoft open world games and the general reviewers comments about towers\, bases and mundane side quests/activities. I do think that if you are a Spidey fan\, as I am\, this will score more than the sum of its parts but as 2018 game\, its not contemporary with what we expect from other open world games now.To address the 'downgrade' issue\, its certainly not a bad looking game at all and there are some areas that are far more complex than the E3 image comparisons we have seen. Whilst its true that scene is a downgrade in terms of complexity\, I can believe that the change was made more out of man-power\, budget and/or time limitations - having to create specific reflections foe every rooftop rather than having one 'generic' reflection and reducing the puddles so that the missing building reflections aren't an issue because of the placement of the smaller puddles was not a decision based on hardware performance. I am sure the PS4 could have handled that scene but Insomniac changed it because they didn't have the time\, budget and/or manpower to create bespoke reflections for 'every' puddle\, every rooftop etc in the game and it was much easier\, as well as take up less space\, to make one 'generic' reflection that can be used everywhere.Anyway\, I am awarding this game a 7 out of 10 as a Spidey fan but you can take 1 off if you are indifferent to Spider-Man. Its a game that 'borrows' from others (Arkham\, Ubisoft Open Worlds etc) and wraps them up in some impressive visuals and relying on Spider-Mans popularity to sell rather than being something 'new' and fresh with the Game-play as its major selling point.… Expand",true

In cinematics\, cut scenes and gameplay but above all that manhattan looks almost like in real life ! and even sounds like it with the traffic\, the people\, and even onsomniac put the actual voice of the subway that say's \""stand clear of the closing doors please\""\, overall the city feels like im actually going outside of my apartment dressed as spiderman (but the city could get better though it still need 200 more things to be accurate but its still fine and im hoping in the sequal it would be a copy paste of the actual city !!!) And damn i have to mention that insomniac also put interiors into the buildings giving each building a dynamic feel to it ! and the cinematics and cut scenes are jaw dropping not just from the looks but also from the acting ! you should bring popcorn when youre playing this game !!! i had moments that i asked myself if this is a video game of a movie ? But anyhow its perfect ! but besides the amazing looks i just talked about the gameplay and controls are amazing as well\, i was hoping to really screw it up with the web slinging around the city and not go well with the combat just like previous spiderman titles but this spiderman takes the glory ! the web slinging is smart and fun and feels very dynamic and amazing ! the combat you need to get used to (and no this is not a arkham style rip off infact the arkham series took the combat from the old ps2 spiderman games) but once you get used to it its great and fun and especially fun when you use youre gadgets ! the gadgets and progression system feels rewarding and fun with loads of cool suits to unlock the gadgets that feel like they came from ratchet and clank ! the soundtrack is beautiful especially when web slinging ! and even in cutscenes the soundtrack overall is great from the guns and vehicles to the music itself and not to mention that even peter parker has 2 recorded voices of the same line incase youre in stressful moments or youre just chiling around the city which gives the game an even more dynamic feeling to it ! But with all that there is also a ton amount of content and effort into the game with loads of challenges and collectibles and places to liberate again ! And not to mention how the story feels and progresses amazingly ! you start as just one simple manhattan spiderman and suddenly the whole city is corrupted and you save it once again ! im not going to talk much about the story because of spoilers but the game tells it in a very good and dramatic way and you really feel the characters emotions and it could make you cry in the end ! but i was most excited that they had put an open ending ! so prepare for a sequal ! But with all that good\, some parts of the game felt a bit mehhh\, like when completing a mission you now have to get all the backpacks back or liberate enemy strongholds its like some main parts of the game are actually guides for side missions and not that interesting the sides quests though only one of them was great when you had to defeat a main super villain but the others felt lame some parts of the missions when you play as other characters are all stealth based with not much else to do but and i wish that there was more effort into the main quests and side missions with more lore of spiderman end investigating the whole game and lore of the avengers that would make something nice. But instead of that they let you catch birds in one side quest lol please insomniac dont make the sequal feel like a chore ! .Overall i think this is an outstanding game its a solid 9/10 for me and could easily reach a ten if some main quests weren't so boring and felt like a chore im really hoping for the dlc and ng+ plus and more updates to come this game is a must have for ps4 owners ! my friends gave their xboxes away after the release of uncharted 4 and they dont regret a second of it ! so buy the digital deluxe if you want i really do recommend getting that i pre orderd it and im just happy that im getting future content and i love how the game makes you feel like spiderman ! it really does ! so to end this review GO OUT NOW AND BUY IT OR BUY IT DIGITALLY LIKE I DID !… Expand",true

Gameplay2. Story3. ReplayabilityGameplay:The gameplay itself is pretty simple\, it's what you would expect from an open world Spiderman game\, climbing or running op walls\, zipping around with your webs\, jumping really high\, etc. Moving around through the city feels amazing due to the fluid controls and looks. The combat here is similar to what you would find in the Batman games\, square and triangle as a light and heavy attacks and then R1 for the gadgets\, circle for dodging\, etc. It's nothing new\, but with Spidey's powers and webs it makes it very fun. There's tons of ways to defeat enemies\, you gotta get creative. With the addition of the suits you can now have new 'ultimate' moves depending on which suit you have\, this again constantly brings a breath of fresh air to the combat. Only downside is again\, it does get pretty repetitive\, even with the different enemy types. The game looks amazing\, the city feels alive\, it's just beautiful to look at in general.Story:The story picks up in Peter's 20's\, he's already had his relationship with MJ and beaten a lot of the vilains. The premise is you get to fight the main bad guys you all know and love again\, Rhino\, Vulture\, Electro\, Doc Ock\, Scorpion\, Mister Negative\, etc. But this only happens later in the story\, because the game really takes it's time in the first half. It can feel kind off slow sometimes\, but ultimately picks up later when the city gets run over by Doc Ock and all his buddies. The story is simple and what you'd expect from a comic book Spiderman\, but it's well executed and doesn't feel forced 'till maybe the last part. They throw a lot of stuff at you rather quickly and it feels a bit rushed. The cutscenes are numerous but really well made\, they did a great job on the looks and voice acting. My only MAJOR downside is the constant repetition of stealth sections with both MJ and Miles\, these were without a doubt the worst parts of the story\, they didn't add much to the game and felt like they were in it for a longer game time. One little **** up like touching boxes and it's game over\, they do remedy this with a good checkpoint system however.Replayability;After the main story\, there are still some things to do. Most of these consist of little minigames that earn you tokens so that you can upgrade your gear and make new suits. This is pretty fun until it gets boring after you've made 3 suits or so. The side mission are weak (aside from mayyybe Tombstone) and don't really serve a purpose. You can complete the game again on a higher difficulty which isn't impossible and a fun challenge.My final verdict: 8.5/10If you're a fan of Spiderman you're gonna love this game\, if you're not a fan of Spiderman and don't enjoy these recurring open world games that are kind of the same\, I wouldn't go for it. I do think you get you're money's worth\, still. Especially with the extra DLC Content… Expand",true

There's a bit of a learning curve (and it's true of the various combat stages\, too)\, but the ability to sling and swing through the streets of Manhattan is so addictive\, you'll find it difficult to employThis game was pure fun\, and I'm not necessarily a fan of Spidey.  Most of what I feel has been said already\, but I'll hit some of my most though-of points.Good: The traversal system.  There's a bit of a learning curve (and it's true of the various combat stages\, too)\, but the ability to sling and swing through the streets of Manhattan is so addictive\, you'll find it difficult to employ the \""fast travel\"" function once it unlocks.Good: Difficulty settings.  Latter-day video games (if you've read any previous review of mine) have upped how hard their \""standard\"" difficulty is.  Spider-man breaks the other way a bit.  Maybe it's a bit too forgiving on its \""Amazing\"" level\, but that's the better alternative.  It still is plenty challenging.Bad: Mary Jane/Miles Morales sneak missions.  They set up a pretty fun showdown in Grand Central Station\, but the rest of them weren't really that necessary (didn't help that I seemed to get caught once or twice in almost every instance by a dude who wasn't there a moment ago).Mixed: Some folks are saying this isn't like the Batman Arkham games.  It absolutely is.  Sole hero taking on multiple villains with little side quests that feature OTHER Spider-man characters\, a steadily deteriorating urban situation as more and more baddies pop up throughout.  I love the Arkham series.  While the free-flow combat was different enough (my steepest learning curve was using \""O\"" to dodge rather than \""Triangle\"" - which is all but programmed into you after playing \""Arkham\"" AND \""Mordor\"")\, I felt the similarities throughout.GREAT: Otto Octavius.  There's some good voice acting in this game (Spidey\, Mary Jane\, J Jonah Jameson)\, but the writing and the performance of William Salyers as Otto Octavius was impeccable.  His descent from optimistic\, never-say-die\, do-right-by-and-for-others scientist into the obsessive\, vengeance-filled Doctor Octopus is pitch perfect the entire way.  Even though you know how it HAS to go\, you find yourself hoping that Otto stays on the right side.  It's one of the more bittersweet performances we'll see.Bad: (Spoilers follow in this section) Despite what I just typed\, the \""twist\"" where it turns out that Doc Ock masterminded the escape of the rest of the Sinister Six doesn't land.  It's too much too fast\, and the writers never bothered to explain how the scientist who didn't have any money to continue his own experiments with prosthetics after Norman Osborn essentially stole what he was working on suddenly had the capital to plan the most elaborate jailbreak New York had ever seen.  The cutscene on the roof of the raft is absolutely spectacular\, but you have to leave logic at the door for it to make sense.Good: Plenty to do\, but not too much.  The side quests are nicely measured.  Most games of this type usually introduce all the little side missions within the first few story missions\, which can feel a little overwhelming.  This game paces the release of those elements.  Raid a base or two\, catch a pigeon\, do a story missions\, repeat.  Level up\, plot your upgrades...do more swinging through the city!Bad: Final boss fight.  I usually don't long for a \""lock\"" button in games\, but in the final fight on top of Oscorp\, I could not get the camera to turn around to keep the boss in frame.  The \""demon\"" fight against Mr. Negative didn't have this problem\, but they couldn't translate the same mechanic to the last battle.  Fortunately\, I only died once.  Also\, it was super-repetitive...to the point where I thought I was in some kind of an infinite loop.  Enemies in this game don't have hit point indicators\, so I thought maybe I wasn't doing something right...until 4th time through the same pattern it finally ended. ... Aaand went into another final confrontation on the side of the building which I wasn't even sure could be lost as there was no health indicator for Spidey anymore.Overall\, I may actually try to play this game on the hardest difficulty\, though I don't think I'll meet with much success.  I'm even considering purchasing the DLC.  I supposed it's the least I could do\, considering I've borrowed this game from a friend\, so i got all this enjoyment without paying for it.Anyway\, good times\, and now that I've seen the preview for the PS5 Spider-Man\, it's clear they were already setting that game up with this one.… Expand",true

It fails to do anything unique with the 'Ubisoft' towers\, with you simply swinging up to them and playing a short minigame.

It's swinging mechanics\, which are the best in any Spider-Man game to date\, are as fun as ever and you can get hours of entertainment just swinging around Manhattan.

The quick answer is yes\, yes it is. End of review right? No I will tell you some reasons to why it is the best Spider-Man game everIt’s taken me some time to write this review for a few reasons\, all being positive ones. The main one is that I enjoyed this game so much I had to grab that platinum for it. Many of you will probably ask yourself “is this the best Spider-Man game ever made?”. The quick answer is yes\, yes it is. End of review right? No I will tell you some reasons to why it is the best Spider-Man game ever made.It’s not just how Insomniac have managed to get a good combat system\, sure for some it might just be like an Assassin’s Creed game. You counter when an indicator shows up on the screen then attack. In some ways that is correct but there is more depth to it than that the further you get into the story\, the tougher the enemies get\, then you need to know all the tricks up Spider-Man’s sleeve. Obviously that’s a big reason to why the game is fun to play\, a good battle system can get you a long way. Easy to learn but takes some time to master. New York looking stunning is a plus too but graphics is never something that is a deal breaker to me\, but a plus nevertheless. The swinging though\, damn does it feel satisfying just to swing around the city even if it is just holding down a button and Spider-Man can do everything himself. You can of course do tricks and there is more to it than that but to get from A to B you just have to hold swing\, release\, hold again. Still it gives a Spider-Man fan great joy just to swing around\, even with ease.What makes me say this is the best Spider-Man game ever made is not those things I previously mentioned though. No what makes this game incredible is the story\, atmosphere and how it truly feels like you are Spider-Man AND Peter Parker. That last part is something every game has lacked. You have the romance with Mary Jane\, Aunt May has an important role\, the friendship with Harry Osborn etc. It’s all there and that is what makes this a complete Spider-Man game in my book. You need the Peter Parker parts to get into the characters\, the love\, the hate and feelings. That and how you face some of Spider-Man’s greatest villains of all time of course. I won’t spoil which though because for that you need to experience the game yourself.The only real negatives I got is I encountered quite a few minor bugs (parkour bugs\, missions bugging out so I had to redo them) which did get tedious at times but mainly since I was going for the platinum and they happened more often along the way of side missions. Also initially the game did seem to be a very vanilla storyline that you’ve seen\, read and played more than once before but trust me it gets better!ProsIt’s a complete Spider-Man experience.Really fun to play.ConsI encountered quite a few small\, but annoying bugs.Some of the storylines have been done a couple of times too many.… Expand",true

Los gráficos son excelentes\, la música también es muy buena\, en especial el tema principal\, la historia me sorprendió de muy buena manera por la rapidez con que el jugador conecta no solo con Spider-Man\, sino también con esta representación de Peter Parker\, que para mi es incluso mejor que en las películas.Pero lo que hay que destacar por encima de todo lo demás\, es la jugabilidad. Balancearse por la ciudad no se había sentido tan fluido y satisfactorio desde Spider-Man 2 de PS2\, al menos en mi opinión. El sistema de combate también es excelente\, fluido y ágil\, que te hace sentir que tenés control total sobre el personaje y sus movimientos\, ataques\, etc. Las peleas tienen muchísimas posibilidades gracias a los diferentes gadgets que uno puede ir desbloqueando\, así como los trajes\, que cada uno tiene un poder especial por defecto. No es un sistema de combate innovador claro está\, pero captura a la perfección el ritmo y la variedad de peleas que Spider-Man puede tener\, también añadiéndole toques especiales de este personaje\, y eso es lo que lo hace excelente. Las partes de sigilo no me parecieron malas. De hecho\, arrastran la misma variedad del combate gracias a que podemos usar los mismos gadgets tanto para el sigilo como para el combate. Pero no se sienten tan satisfactorias o impactantes\, incluso si las hacemos a la perfección.Esto me lleva a hablar de los puntos negativos (SPOILERS):. Mary Jane: sí\, durante ciertos segmentos controlamos a Mary Jane\, pero son únicamente misiones de sigilo que se nota que solo están ahí para añadir tiempo de juego\, es decir\, de relleno. Con el tiempo se vuelven pesadas y estás esperando terminarlas lo antes posible para volver a controlar a Spider-Man.. El espaciado irregular en las peleas contra jefes: apenas empezar el juego\, peleamos contra un jefe. Poco tiempo después\, peleamos contra otro. Pero después hay una increíble brecha de tiempo en la que no nos enfrentamos a ningún peso pesado. Pasada esta brecha\, es prácticamente un jefe tras otro hasta el final del juego. Las peleas son todas de alto nivel\, eso seguro. Pero están mal repartidas a lo largo de la historia.. Misiones Secundarias: si bien algunas son muy buenas\, como la de Tombstone\, la mayoría sufren de el síndrome \""mandado\"". Son las típicas misiones que implican \""andá a tal lugar\, traeme tal cosa o salvá a tal persona\"". En mi opinión se podrían haber trabajado y pulido un poco más. Me divertí más incluso con los desafíos de Taskmaster.. La presencia de DLCs: es una lástima que este juego no se haya salvado de caer en la tendencia del Season Pass. Este consta de 3 DLCs con posibilidad de haber más. Si bien no tiene un precio desorbitante como los Season Pass de otros juegos\, tranquilamente podría haber sido contenido incluido en el juego base. No aprendieron de God of War.Para mi es un sólido 8 porque incluso con sus puntos negativos\, es un juego culpable de brindar muchas horas de diversión y contenido.

Years of lackluster movie tie-ins with occasional strokes of genius helped inform the design of this entry and it's the most refined superhero experience available.The visuals are excellent\, particularly the beautifully-rendered. sunset-soaked scale replica of New York and the facial animations of the main cast. It's no easy feat to recreate a real-life city with all the major landmarks and make it seem real and lived in. The game world is bustling and alive and never feels artificial. Crimes pop up randomly\, there's traffic jams\, pedestrian conversations are realistic and the weather/atmosphere/day-night effects are stunning. Add to this fantastic sound design in the voice acting and score (which reacts and changes depending to your current activity - genius!)\, you have a lovingly-crafted presentation. The story is so good\, and surprisingly emotional\, grounded by probably my favourite Peter Parker ever. Seriously\, he is the most capable\, likable and relatable Spider-Man yet.Gameplay is equally impressive. The swinging controls are pitch-perfect and traversing Manhattan is a joy. Fast-travel is neglected completely. 3 km journey? Easy\, swing the whole way. Running along building faces\, catapulting off edges\, zipping to faraway ledges\, flipping\, diving\, it's all exhilarating. Combat is in general very good in most respects and gets tougher and tougher as you go along. It's basic Arkham-style button bashing but with web-shooting and much faster/nimbler. The skill upgrade trees feel a bit shallow in all honesty and don't impact your combat massively and the controls can be a bit fiddly when walls/obstacles are near (Spider-Man gets confused whether you want him to dodge a punch or scale a wall then GET punched). Overall\, I really enjoyed the variety of side quests/collectibles on offer most however (camera quests\, collectathons\, story-driven side quests\, challenges\, base takeovers\, science experiments). I platinumed the game last night and the only tedious aspect was completing all randomised crimes\, as these can be very samey. Boss fights were the most disappointing gameplay aspect in a purely [practical sense. Their design\, atmosphere\, story linkage was AMAZING\, but the fights were so boring and essentially identical for all major bosses. Considering the variety of excellent villains this is weird\, but didn't spoil the fun entirely. Stealth sections as other characters were a bit of a pace destroyer but were OK.I need to shout out to the unlockable suits here\, they are fantastic and their unique abilities easily make the biggest impact on combat and look incredible. A great addition.Ultimately\, this is the quintessential Spider-Man experience that shouldn't be missed\, despite its few minor annoyances/pacing issues/shallow upgrade system. Swinging about is worth the price itself\, in my opinion\, and won't be topped!… Expand",true

I’m a huge fan of most of Insomniac’s games\, and I had no doubt in my mind that this was going to be at least okay. I also noticed that the game kind of had physics similar to that of ‘Sunset Overdrive’\, which is a great game that doesn’t get talked about enough\, by the way. The puzzles were also very similar to some I’ve seen in ‘Ratchet and Clank’ games. Anyway\, I’ll just break down the basics of this game.The controls were easily the best part of this game. Web slinging feels like second nature for traveling across the map. I only used fast travel a few times because I loved web slinging everywhere. It‘s really satisfying to free fall and swing up just before you hit the ground. I experienced a few glitches\, one that crashed the game\, but nothing major besides that.The story was okay until the Sinister Six is formed\, then it was great. I don’t know if that’s a spoiler\, but I’m going to assume not. The ending was satisfying\, and I liked it a lot. Also\, the graphics were great.The story missions were all good when you play as Spider-Man\, but when you play as MJ or Miles.... I was in the middle of a mission with MJ\, and I nearly turned the game off and walked away for good. Luckily\, I stuck with it\, and there weren’t a lot of these missions\, but it’s easily the worst part of the game. Side missions where a fun distraction from the story missions. I like that they introduce different things you can do in the game with what you’re given.The collecting stuff (landmarks\, backpacks\, bases\, Black Canary hideouts\, pigeons\, crimes\, labs) was fun. There where fun excuses for Marvel references and to explore places you otherwise wouldn’t. I got everything done before I finished the story except for the crimes. The crimes where painful because I finished everything else and I was just kind of sitting around and waiting for crime. They pop up about every one to ten minutes or something. Completely random. Also\, the lab stuff was stupid and repetitive.The challenges were fine. I’ve heard people complain about stealth challenges\, but I liked finding new ways to use gadgets.The skill tree was done as well as it could’ve been done. You start with the essential controls and the skill tree just builds on that. The suits were really cool. Every single one of them were interesting and unique. I also like that you can mix and match suits and suit powers. The other abilities were all fun to use and helpful in one way or another.If it seems like I don’t like a lot of the game\, most of the things I mentioned as ‘okay’ were made better by the controls. But f**k MJ and Miles. But\, really\, overall\, this game was really fun and I had a great time despite it’s really terrible shortcomings.… Expand",true

I had some minor issues with glitches where guys came through walls but nothing that really took me out of the game in that department to break it.Storywise...you kind of knew where this was going to go because \,if you looked the trophies (and I did) you already had your idea of where this game would be going as far as the main story path so...no real shock especially even if you had a \""base knowledge\"" of Spider-Man (and I did despite my big franchise that I cared about being that of X-Men so there is that to consider.My big problem?  Controls believe it or not and some side contentI'll tackle \""side content\"" firstI play a lot of open world games.  One of my favorites of recent memory is Sleeping dogs which I have 100%'d the collectibles at least twice.  This game had its collectibles and its special puzzles to do but the thing is that in order to do some of the content you had to wait for it to come around and this becomes an issue especially when the game \""progression locks\"" you (which should never HAVE to be done.  The point of \""side content\"" is just that...its optional so you can progress the storyline!For some reason Insomniac decided it was a great idea to make the story (which is all of three acts long) lock itself at times behind side content.  Only when you played a certain # of missions did you get the opportunity to play the story again so being able to get through the game as quickly as possible...not that easy!I mean look:  Watch Dogs (which is not as bad a game as some make it out to be) had a lot of side content to do BUT you COULD just steamroll through the story and just do that if you wanted (and some did but you would miss being able to hack phones \,see cool side content\, and the like so by skipping that you would be missing out on a lot in the world.  By being forced to do some side content in Spider-Man you kind of are basically told\""We don't care what YOU want to do because you HAVE to play the game this way\""Yes this is an irritant with me if you can't tellNow as much as I complain about it you know my favorite side quests?  Sable Outposts and I admit the main reason is cos the woman that runs Sable I actually liked.  I think in some twisted way she was one of the characters that found a way to endear herself to me BETTER than some of the other characters (and that's a shame cos I actually like Doctor Octopus a lot).(The only thing that sucked about Sable is I legitimately can't remember the woman's name...help a brother out?!)Controls were a weird mixed bag cos trying to get used to NOT having a \""proper counter\"" button (Hello \""Sleeping Dogs\"") was one of the things I wrestled with and even swinging through the city sometimes the web swings wouldn't detach when I wanted them to which will cost you in the \""Taskmaster\"" challenges.  I SHOULD have had one a couple of times but the game didn't register when I was trying to let go and it cost me a lot.  Maybe this is just my controller but when you have an issue like this cost you its plenty frustrating in a legitimate sense!All in all is the game bad?  No but I am harder on AAA games than indies because I expect a lot more from my $$$ than i feel Insomniac could give me for this price tag.  Catch it on a sale and trust me its not bad but for the $60...its just above average for me and that is depressing to say… Expand",true

The pacing of the story is\, at times\, relatively slow and the narrative often takes the drivers seat while enjoyable gameplay gets pushed to the back\, mostly in the Peter Parker\, Miles Morales\, and Mary Jane specific sections of the game. These could have been approached in a less linear sense and perhaps could have been more enjoyable but they often force the game to a standstill. Other times\, on multiple occasions\, Spider-Man is being delivered a monologue and all you're doing is hopping along like a frog\, or dare I say jumping spider\, and listening. And listening more. When I compare this to the way God of War delivered an A+ narrative experience without taking me out of well paced gameplay\, using set pieces and cinematics to move the narrative in surprising\, exciting\, and creative ways\, I feel as though Spider-Man could have done so much more here. The potential is here in droves\, and I still love this game to death and will continue to play it for years to come\, I just hope insomniac can take the time to craft a quality sequel that takes everything this game created as a foundation to truly flesh out this world in a more engaging way.

Where the game truly shines is in it's storytelling\, which I won't go into any detail on as not to spoil anything\, but I will say it's pacing in it's escalation and the ways it effects are felt as you traverse the open world are astounding. Your actions and the progression of events really has an effect on New York city\, one I hope you can recognize and enjoy as much as I did while you take the time to unfold a new chapter in the epic of Marvel's Spider-Man.… Expand",true

By the time I'd finished the DLC\, I was beyond ready for it to end in spite of hardly touching its side-content. I had long-since zoned-out and been listening to podcasts while I played....It almost seems like a meme at this point but the combat 100% is derived from Batman Arkham. It offers enough changes and feels different enough to justify its existence but it is still derivative nonetheless. All-in-all\, it feels a lot faster and appropriately lets you zip between enemies\, giving it its own unique flavor. The stealth sections are here too and don't overstay their welcome but feel a little under-cooked. You also play as 2 other characters for a couple of sections but these are pretty groan-worthy\, shoehorning in scripted stealth sequences where you're not able to make choices in how you approach problems.While the combat is Arkham\, the overall structure leans more toward the Ubisoft-open-world model\, with map-towers\, crimes\, collectibles\, etc. If it resembles one of the Batmans in particular\, it would be Arkham Knight for this exact reason\, which most people had a more mixed response as a result. There's a million icons on your map and you could easily double your time if you engage with all of this stuff. It's tragically not that compelling though\, and the main quest and especially the DLC have a lot of this fluff in them as well. Spider-Man's bag of tricks runs out reasonably quickly\, turning it into a string of combat-enounters\, chase sequences\, cutscenes\, hacking minigames\, etc. It never dwells on anything too long but very few sequences in this game left a lasting impression. Thankfully\, around 2/3 of the way through\, NYC becomes overrun with crime and at this point\, the campaign and open-world become a lot more interesting but I couldn't help wishing this had happened much earlier in the game. This is something the Batman games did at the start of their games\, to great effect.The most disappointing thing about Spider-Man is its lackluster level design. Insomniac has crafted some of the best levels in gaming history with Spyro and Ratchet & Clank but here\, they've shackled themselves to a realistic map of NYC that just isn't very interesting to explore. In spite of how much the visuals and detail have been improved in this entry\, it's still no more interesting to explore than it was on the PS2. The real shame here is that the Arkham games actually have great level-design! In contriving various video-gamey settings like a city-turned-prison or snow-storm\, the Batman games were able to have settings that were more interesting to explore and better lent themselves to a video game. This drove me to do every sidequest and find every riddler trophy throughout the whole series. Spider-Man\, however\, just has a bunch of generic buildings and pedestrians walking around everywhere. Ironically\, the most interesting areas of the game are when it deviates from the open world and copies ideas outright from Batman with a great prison level and some dream levels that are a little to close to Batman for comfort.To sum up\, the combat is good but derivative\, the story is great\, the mission variety is lacking but improves toward the end\, and the side content and DLC fail to make compelling cases for their existences. To me\, it's the definition of solid but nothing special. It might seem like I've made too many comparisons to Batman but Spider-Man is absolutely shameless in the way it borrows ideas and much of the game's world and structure is objectively worse than how Arkham City handled things 7 years earlier. Spider-man PS4 is significant to me in that it's where Insomniac has gone from being a leader to a follower. It's a very good game\, especially if you're a Spider-fan but it fails to offer anything new or exceptional to gaming as a whole.… Expand",true

The soundtrack is well-used\, the various suits you can unlock are all great\, and the graphics are fantastic as you web-sling through a gorgeous New York City filled with all of the major landmarks\, including even the Avengers tower. Characters for the most part were handled well\, and the various side-missions were also enjoyable\, if not a bit repetitive.What held this game back for me was in how they handled Mary Jane. I wasn't too fond of her character in this\, as well as the MJ and Miles Morales missions that made up a portion of the main story content. These were missions in which you took control of MJ and Miles in stealth sections. The problem with this is that I did not find these sections enjoyable as they essentially amounted to \""throw this thing\"" or \""hack this thing\""\, random thug reacts like a brainless zombie\, then you sneak by loudly\, still probably within peripheral vision but whatever it's stealth ya'll this is how it works I guess. When Spidey himself is so enjoyable to play\, switching to either of these two characters in these contrived sections of 'stealth' felt like a pain.Overall\, however\, the game is great and despite the flaws I would still consider this to be the quintessential Spider-Man game and I hope that they build on this foundation with a potential sequel. 8/10.… Expand",true

Spiderman PS4 is easily the best spiderman game ever made\, but to be honest there wasn’t a very high bar to swing over. The story while enjoyable is a tad predictable barring one mission\, but it didn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. In terms of the story\, it’s set 8 years into Peter’s role as the Web-Head\, and it’s to the game's credit\, it was a great choice to not focus on the origin story\, after three different movie series it would have grown tired to hear it all again. In terms of gameplay I have never enjoyed traversal through a game more than I had with Spiderman. Swinging through the city is so much fun once you get the hang of it\, and it doesn’t take long to comprehend it. It’s so seamless to control spiderman and go from point A to point B. I’m going to try to not fall into the basic troupes like other reviews but the feeling this game gives you can only be described as Spectacular.. Or Amazing.. Or.. Superior? My point is this game makes you really feel like you’re spiderman.. #&@$! I really enjoyed this mid-twenties Peter Parker\, it made it easy to relate with him on everyday life things from Rent\, to relationships with others. Spidey’s development as a character was a journey for not only Pete\, but to me as the player. Watching Spiderman’s heart break over the villains he once called his mentors. The Combat is good enough; feeling like something from the Arkham series but you’ll go far to separate that thought from your head. Later parts of the game were a little grating as it feels like a nonstop flight\, if you want truly be your friendly neighborhood Spidey friend I was also disappointed that you only really get to deal with supervillains in the last act of the game. You can only do so much with minions and I thought the main plot line with Mr.Negative could have used a break or two with missions to stop Scorpion\, Electro or Vulture. Kingpin’s tutorial mission was the biggest disappointment. Could you imagine if the game had instead opened with Rhino charging through Times Square? Lastly I want speak about the side characters in the story\, the ones who helped drive the story. I loved their inclusion to the overall story between Aunt May running the homeless Shelter F.E.A.S.T. or the introduction of Miles Morales or Mary Jane Watson. With a few exceptions I don’t think there was a reason to make missions where we have to play as either of the latter two side characters and sneak around enemies and throw distraction tools and tell spiderman witch of the baddies to take out next. I bought the game for Spiderman\, just let me play as the damn Spidered Man. quick side note; James Jonah Jameson was a delight in this game and reminded me of how much i loved his role in the Toby McGuire Movie Trilogy.

New York has been realized convincingly with tall skyscrapers and a convincing populace. Spider-Man 2 allowed you to go to ground level\, ride a car here or there\, recover a kids balloon\, deliver Pizza's. But this feels far more robust.There are dynamic events throughout the city to engage in. Maybe you stop a getaway car. Foil a robbery. Spot some thugs on a roof top? Send them flying over the edge only to see them stuck to the side of the wall.The combat is excellent. There is such a rhythm to it. You can dive between an enemy's legs\, hit a guy behind them\, bounce backward\, web a manhole cover and twirl it about before sending it into some hapless goons noggin. Then you have all your web abilities like a web bomb\, spider drone and more to boot.The web swinging has been done wonders too with a number of tricks you can perform.All of these really shine in the outposts and hideouts you can take down using a mix of stealth and bare knuckle fisticuffs.There are plenty of collectibles to collect that can then be used to unlock suits and upgrades. Insomniac didn't stop though. They continued adding new suits and fresh content with DLC including the beloved Raimi suit.The story too is frankly amazing.

This is the superior Spider-Man experience.First of all\, this game looks stunning\, considering you’re usually moving at high speeds across the city and it manages to maintain a solid framerate even when slowing down at a moment’s notice there isn’t that much in concerns of pop in and it just never ceases to amaze me at the pure beauty of this game.Next let’s talk about the most crucial element\, the web slinging. It’s is better than we could’ve hoped\, personally I feel it is better than Spider-Man 2s and any other game featuring the web head. It’s fluid\, with it being intertwined with the free running the moment you hit and surface you’ll smoothly transition into a wall run or even some parkour. And with point launches it’s easy to maintain your momentum when traveling above buildings where you can no longer attach your webs because yes\, they actually have to attach to objects.Next let’s talk some nice details: The costumes\, there are plenty of different suits that we can use throughout the game personally I would’ve liked more with a range of them being very similar for example the Spider-Undies & ESU Suit are entertaining at first but they get boring fast especially the ESU suit and with it being the reward for all the secret photo ops I was slightly disappointed. The photo mode is super easy to use and you can take some truly remarkable photos with it\, I at various points would just go and take a selfie like mid-boss fight and they were some of my highlights just making the silliest possible photos. And the very best part\, the iconic pizza theme from the Spider-Man 2 game is also in this game some real love has gone into this game.I want to touch on the story and wow is it amazing\, it feels like more than a simple Spider-Man story\, it has characters we care about\, it has moments where you’re praying for one thing to happen only to get heartbroken when the inevitable happens. Recently I’ve started to just ignore some stories and have a video or music playing in the background while I play games but with this game I had to focus on the game and so I didn’t resort to anything else because I was just that engrossed and didn’t feel I needed any additional methods of entertainment to enhance my experience the game and its narrative was simply enough.Here’s where we enter spoiler territory\, as I want to discuss parts of the story\, that being the inevitable transformation of Doc Ock\, we get to see Otto’s motivations and we truly feel for him\, we see how he is at his heart a good man with him leaving Oscorp when the experiments started to become harmful\, and with him making prosthetics for those who need help. And when we find out about his condition it feels like a punch to the gut because we care about him and hearing that he’s losing many of his bodily functions we start to understand his motivations for making the four arms but by that point we all know that it is too late because it’s a Spider-Man game and well Doc Ock isn’t known for his heroic acts.

72712,MSMPS4,2018-09-23,9,"After the disaster that was the movie based \""Amazing Spider-man\"" games most thought the iconic hero was better left alone\, seeing that no recent games have come close to capturing the experience 2004's \""Spider-man 2\"". However\, one developer decided to have a go at it. Under the microscope of gamers and faithful Spider-man fans alike\, Insomniac not only capture the magic of 2004 but using today's technology made it even better! This game has obviously been made with time and passion in a time when games are usually made for commercial gain and not the craft.GRAPHICS: I bought the digital copy of Spider-man on the PS4 Slim (PS4 exclusive unfortunately). When i first loaded in the game\, I noticed rendering issues with some textures\, mainly on buildings. I'm not sure if it was my PS4 being slow or a download issue but the problem seemed to work itself out within an hour. Other than that\, the graphics were really good overall. Not quite up to par with what was shown in the first gameplay video Insomniac put out but still very beautiful lighting effects and textures.COMBAT: As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the \""Batman: Arkham\"" combat system\, Spider-man's combat system wasn't anything new to me. Though many people think that this game ripped off the combat from the \""Arkham\"" games\, 2004's Spider-man game had an even more similar system to the new Spider-man. I recommend playing on the hardest difficulty as to adequately challenge yourself.Overall\, the combat flows really well\, using combos\, gadgets\, and throws to take down enemies. Still can be improved by updates.TRAVERSAL: We all know web-swinging is whats truly important for most Spider-man fans and the physics are hard to get right. 2004's Spider-man had previously been the reigning swinging champion up to this point. However\, with Insomniac's traversal experience with one of their previous titles\, \""Sunset Overdrive\""\, and today's technology\, their Spider-man game rightfully takes the prize in web-swinging. I go hours just swinging around New York (which is huge just FYI) and not get bored\, doing flips\, dives\, and tricks. The game has fast travel via subway but i never used it because swinging is much more fun.CUSTOMIZATION: Spider-man is a great character with many comic storylines and SUITS. Insomniac spoils us with over 25 suits to be unlocked through XP or collectables\, all coming with their own special suit abilities. Suits that you have equipped are also shown in cutscenes which is really nice. You also unlock skills and gadgets via different tokens obtained through side missions and activities. You will eventually get all abilities so don't be afraid to spend skill points.STORY/MISSIONS: Insomniac's take on our hero skips the overplayed origin story and starts 8 years after Peter Parker has been Spider-man. This is really refreshing to have a game that assumes you know the \""old news\"" stuff and puts you in a whole new story. The build up is kind of slow and the middle of the game is a entertaining and delightful mystery type sequence with great focus and mission variation. The third act\, while epic and fun\, throws a lot at you with not much game left. It feels like Insomniac almost forgot to put villains in the story and crammed all in to the third act. Boss battles are somewhat repetitive and don't have much innovation. The side missions are also repetitive and don't really offer good stories. There are many collectables and bases to gather and complete and it never feels like you have nothing to do. In conclusion\, Spider-man has a well-written captivating story that feels like authentic Spider-man and makes you care with real stakes and emotion shown through impressive facial animations but does have a few issues that are annoying yet forgivable.In my opinion\, Spider-man is a must cop. Go out and buy it. Its a fun experience that no one should pass up and I wont forget my experience any time soon. Though not extremely innovational\, it never leaves you bored and is done well and right.… Expand",true

72731,MSMPS4,2018-09-18,10,"This game caused me to create a metacritic\, just so I could talk about how great it is. Let me start out by saying: all other games and movies now seem to be mere imitations. In this game\, it feels like you are really\, truly playing as the one and only Spider-Man. I desperately want more. It's an experience\, where after I was done\, it was still fun to swing around\, solve crimes and beat challenges. Minor spoilers follow.Story: I liked the story in Web of Shadows - they really rode the dark undertones well. But it doesn't cut close to the emotional\, humorous and gripping story of Marvel's Spider-Man. With a cast of interesting and well-written characters supporting it\, no moment is ever boring. I was very impressed with the heavy investment in \""the feels\"" and I can only say to Insomniac: it is great and you can take it even further. I'm ready for the upcoming new game plus\, so I can enjoy it all over again.Combat: hit the nail! It remains challenging and fun throughout the entire game. While clearly inspired by\, they've abandonded the counter-mechanics of the Arkham Series's combat\, in favor of rapid movement and dodging. You have a plethora of options to choose from\, where as the decision on your best move has to be made in the span of half a second\, thus making Spidey bounce around and doing the coolest stunts in a most spectaclar fashion. It feels and looks both smooth and powerful.Super battles: there are several villains in this game\, one of the earlier ones being Shocker. The chase sequence with him\, is probably the only chase in any game\, I've ever really enjoyed. It was really fantastic\, and it leaves a lot of room for choice of traversal. And then they made the interesting choice of pairing the super villains up late game\, which worked insanely well. I wish they'd have moved away from the tradition of endlessly repeated patterns\, but having two baddies at the same time\, sure upped the game tremendously.Traversal: swinging is the best ever\, no doubt. They've created a system\, where nothing stops you - you can just keep going. It's something that you really have to practice to be good at\, but when you do... Wow!Side activities:All fun! I only wished they'd maybe include more side quests related to smaller villains\, like they did with Tombstone. Hammer Head\, Hydroman\, Jack O Lantern\, Hitman\, Silvermane... The Rose\, maybe. That would've been really fun\, but of course only if they made them interesting characters too\, not just for the sake of including them.Now I cna only wait for the DLC and hopefully in the future: the next game :D Huge success and congratulations on making the most perfect Spider-Man experience ever\, Insomniac.… Expand",true

Will this game be as bad as the Activision games of the past or will Insomniac’s record help Spider-Man have an amazing game?Story: We start the game with a college-age Peter Parker\, trying to balance pay rent on time\, having a job as a scientist and being Spider-Man. In most other media\, Peter Parker is just a normal kid just trying to get through high school. Seeing this older Peter Parker makes for a more engaging story as you see Peter go through more serious situation in his normal life. As for Peter being Spider-Man\, it just feels like your standard Marvel movie plot. It’s a good story with a few twists and some interesting character developments\, just don’t expect it to be a complete overhaul of a new story just because Peter is a bit older.Gameplay: The gameplay is what makes this game really shine. Traversing through the city is so much fun. Insomniac web swing mechanic is amazing and is the best we have ever seen in a Spider-Man game. Combat is just as good with the fluid way Spider-Man moves around the screen and how every move you pull off feels nice\, satisfying and interconnected. There are many ways to take down your foes with the variety of gadgets and moves you will unlock throughout the game. All this would make the game near flawless if it was not for the fact that the enemies do get repetitive near the last 3rd when the variety of enemies becomes nonexistent. This is alleviated a bit with stealth sections that allow you to play as some other characters within the universe. (But I won’t spoil it here ;)) Side mission can be fun and plentiful but some also have the problem of becoming very repetitive. Boss fights are also underwhelming since all you need to do to beat the bosses is stun them and punch. The fights look flashy but the cool looking set pieces don’t make up for the lackluster fights. This could have been fixed if your arsenal of gadgets were useful during these fights. Even with these faults\, it is still the most engaging Spider-Man game yet.Technical: The visuals are stunning even on a regular PS4. Photorealistic looking people with amazing motion capture. Cutscenes\, the open world\, fighting enemies all looks superb. Music is pretty good but nothing too special. Sounds similar the generic music from an MCU film. The game has minor glitches like enemies getting stuck in areas\, requiring me to restart the checkpoint. Technics are super polished but some minor gameplay bugs needed to be ironed outVerdict: Despite its fault\, Marvel’s Spider-Man is an amazing experience. An incredibly polished open world game with the best Spider-Man mechanic to date. A fun story through a different take on Peter Parker life. Amazing performances and motion capture that suit the ultra-real looking graphics. If you have a PS4\, it is a must-have game. I just hope that Insomniac Games will make a squeal to this game so they can fix there few flaws and make a masterful game.8/10 “Great”+Fun Story+Best Spider-Man Gameplay to Date+Amazing Visuals+Lots to do in the open world-Minor Bug and Glitches-Boss Fights are too repetitive and easy-Repetitious side missions… Expand",true

As of this posting\, only God Of War could have been considered my personal GOY title\, but no longer.There are a few primer points I should levy here about me personally that influenced me and my feelings on this game:1) Born New York Native2) Lived in NYC during 9/11I make that second point solely because of the Terrorist attacks that take place within the game\, which is why I used the spoiler tag for this review. I don't generally like the term \""Triggered\,\"" but honestly\, when Mr. Negative suicide bombs City Hall\, I legitimately broke down and had to stop playing for an awhile. Between the smoke and fire\, people fleeing from the explosion\, twisted iron rods and concrete scattered around the ground amongst the bodies brought me right back to those events. And while of course\, this is a game set in a fictional NYC\, the later #NYCSTRONG found in Spidery twitter feed is something New Yorkers in real life would have done\, and do to this day.I wanted to get that out of the way first because \""above the fold\,\"" but the title at large is amazing (see what I did there).*Visually the game is beautiful. Water effects are top notch as is many of the buildings. Environmental effects feel real as does the population at large. One of the best moments to stick out for me was after I found the Ghostbusters firehouse and some random dude on the corner wanted to give me a High-five. Look\, this is accurate\, New Yorkers would do something like that. He even stood behind while I took a selfie.*Speaking of the selfie\, this might be the first time in a game I've used this feature (when applicable). It just works well and fits in a game centered around one of the most famous cities in the world).*Combat is fun and stays fun throughout the game. Leveling abilities though stopped being \""Upgrades\"" after about halfway through each tree. They felt less new and more just icing on the cake. If they weren't there\, you wouldn't notice it.*Suits and Suit Abilities: Look\, I'll whittle it down for you: I found myself using the Spider Bro and Spider Drones like 90% of the time the rest of them never saw the light of day. Insomniac didn't balance the usefulness of these (instead focused on the flow of combat by the player). This was fine for me\, but honestly\, you could take on nearly everything with the above combo.Spiderpunk is awesome! I have never done cosplay in my entire life\, but Spiderpunk--yea I'd do it. The Comic suit was great\, the \""dark suit\"" was cool as was the Avengers inspired \""Iron Spider\"" suit found in Infinity War. I found myself playing dress-up for both selfie's AND for cutscenes. The endgame \""suits\"" aren't all that great\, but what you get is still really good.Story-Story was both light-hearted\, depressing and obvious but is a positive for me. The voice acting is top-notch as was the emoting from all characters in particular Miles (for me at least). Peter does have a few \""derp face moments\"" (So does MJ) but not enough to sour the experience. I hate (really love) Insomniac for building a significant relationship between Peter and Dr. Ock banking on us knowing that he's going to fall. What I didn't like was that that fall comes in THIS GAME. Swerving away from the perceived Mr. Negative as the main villain at around the 75% mark kind of upended the narrative\, but once I got past this\, I found myself interested. I wish it came in the eventual follow-up. For that though\, we have Norman...Turning J.Jhonah into an Alex Jones clone was spot-on--didn't stop me from despising him any less. Half-truths are lies wrapped in conviction\, and Insomniac nailed this.Quests and content: The stimmed \""collect (x)\"" thing or \""fight that\"" system worked for me. Once something new popped up on the map I rushed to clear it out. That worked for most of the game\, until the very end when the game drags out the last quarter of it with padding. It could have been less here and made it feel uneven.Conclusion: I just finished this the other night. For the first time in a long time\, I'll be popping back into the world after the credits to hunt down the hidden camera shots and frankly to explore a very inaccurate Manhattan. There's no Staten Island Ferry terminal\, but the ferry can be seen throughout the city. Roosevelt Island has disappeared and someone needs to tell Lin Manuel Miranda that Washington Heights is now a body of water and a highway to Yonkers.

It never felt boring or slow and the story was fantastic and emotional. It didn't need to be this good but I can safely say it's up there with the other great exclusives.The combat was fast and never too complicated but always a challenge and each and every gadget felt useful. Stringing combos and using gadgets at the right time was so satisfying.Traversing NY was a blast. A little slow at first but eventually after getting the hang of it I was swinging like the best of them. I only used the subway for the trophy. Connecting swinging with point launching and wall running was super cool and streamlined just enough.The story and characters were wonderful and extremely well acted. Yuri Lowenthall and Laura Bailey have outdone themselves and they are not just another Peter Parker and MJ. The supporting characters and the main villain do a great job too. The civilians are also well acted though their voices get repetitive due to only a few actors voicing them.It's held back from perfection by a few bugs. Nothing game breaking but distracting. I got trapped in walls at one point\, sometimes enemies would get trapped and mechanics that were supposed to work just wouldn't. The controls are tight but also not perfect. They work but expect to accidentally tly target the wrong enemy or run up the wrong wall.This is a must play and while it achieves the greatness it advertises it misses the perfect score by a hairs breadth due to distracting bugs and control issues.9.5/10… Expand",true

This game has the best fan service I have ever seen. Nearly every major and minor character from the Spider-Man universe is accounted for (there is even Stan Lee in a sweet\, MCU-style cameo)\, while Spider-Man has to face several of his biggest enemies. The city traversal by web slinging is my favorite part of the whole game\, nothing beats the sensation of climbing atop the Avengers Tower or the Oscorp towering HQ. Not to mention how cute it is to greet virtual people on the streets and shake hands with them\, or taking selfies with the photo mode. Insomniac Games have done a tremendous job in the fan service department.What makes Marvel's Spider-Man stand out from other superhero games is the focus of its story on Peter Parker (who has been a crimefighter for 8 years) as a young adult who struggles to balance his personal\, professional and superhero lives. Parker's relationship with Mary Jane and Aunt May is explored in a great way\, as well as the relationship between Peter and his mentor. The main plot is not an adaptation of some classic Spider-Man story arc\, it's a cinematic re-imagining of the established Marvel Comics mythos of Spider-Man\, just like the MCU movies introduced modern takes on classic characters.This game is often compared with the Batman Arkham series of games\, but it's really based on the PS2-era Spider-Man 2 game. Nevertheless\, the fluid combat and traversal system are influenced by the Batman Arkham series and the Spider-Man 2 game. The game's meant to be played by everyone\, so if you are a seasoned gamer you better switch difficulty to Hard instead of the standard Normal\, this way you'll really enjoy the game and appreciate the combat system's intricacies. The map's layout in districts and the need to clear criminality in each neighbor are inspired by the inFamous series of games. There are also a few stealth sections where you don't control Spider-Man\, and have to avoid enemy detection\, Metal Gear Solid-style.Other than the presence of a few QTEs\, the only real downside of this game is that\, unlike the main story path\, the side content is of varying quality. There are some great side quests\, and many others that are repetitive. Sure there is plenty of busy work outside the main story path\, like bringing enemy forts down or doing challenges\, but variety is lacking.On the technical side\, the graphics are top notch. There was the usual \""downgrade\"" accusation on Twitter\, but it was later proven to be wrong. You can see the whole of New York from the top of a skyscraper with impressive draw distances\, and pop-in during web-slinging is almost non-existent. The soundtrack is inspired by the MCU movies and is wonderful. The sound effects are excellent. The voice acting for all the major characters is superb.Marvel's Spider-Man is a great game made by Insomniac Games\, the first high-calibre game Marvel's got in many years. Just like an MCU movie\, this game ends with a couple of post-credits scenes\, teasing a potential sequel. Maybe Marvel's Spider-Man will kick off a Marvel Interactive Universe\, just like the Iron Man movie initiated the MCU phaenomenon back in 2008. I can't wait for the Avengers game and Marvel's Spider-Man 2!… Expand",true

At times you almost feel compelled to play the main missions because it consumes you.Much talk and comparisons have been made to the combat system of the “Arkham” games. The mechanics are similar but that is where it ends. Batman is my favorite hero bar none. I wanted to play as I played the Arkham games; but I would soon learn that I was so out of my league that I died numerous times.For all its brilliance that developer crafted into the game this game has some issues that need to be discussed. The first and most infuriating is the long load times. There are no transactions from mission to mission and at times while loading the screen goes black. This takes you out of your moment as you are all pumped up by playing only to be pulled out by the screen going black. In this day and age this is shouldn’t happen. (To be fair I played the game on a PS4 and I do not know if PS4-Pro had this issue.)The camera could be a bit wonky as at times\, especially during heavy combat\, the camera would get stuck in a position and it would not move.  Then the game has many QuickTime Events (QTE) which I find bothersome\, however to the credit the developers they added a way to disable QTE’s in the setting menu.Finally the “Spidey-Sense” could also lag at time. When you are about to take a hit the warning starts out white\, when it turns blue then you need to move or you will be hit; unfortunately it sometimes doesn’t work as designed.Insomniac crafted this game vividly. Their attention to details is superb\, even showing incoming numbers and Peter’s phone when he puts it to its ear. There are numerous references to the Marvel Universe as well as other Easter Eggs giving props to other games and even the DC-Verse.If you own a PS4\, you must play this game\, the graphics are breathtaking\, the sand-box that is Manhattan is vast and beautiful to roam about in. Even after you finish the main story\, there is much to play and discover. If you own a XBOX you can watch game-play\, but do not give the game a bad rating because you’re upset this game did not come to X-Box as I do not think that even Phil Spencer would approve of the practice.… Expand",true

Eventually\, at E3\, we learned it was actually Insomniac\, the people behind \""Spyro\,\"" \""Ratchet & Clank\"" and \""Sunset Overdrive\"" making the game...but screw it\, I love Insomniac\, too\, so keep those hype-thrusters rolling! Marvel was finally out of the whole Activision deal and announced they were working with the best game devs to make titles that would be faithful to their characters (still waiting on that \""Avengers\"" project\, Square Enix) and my excitement was through the roof! And as more and more gameplay was being shown\, I had a feeling it would be something special\, potentially even eclipsing the high-standard set by \""Spider-Man 2\"" back in the day. And let me tell you\, it does more than eclipse that.\""Spider-Man\"" for PlayStation 4 plays like a dream. Never has swinging around the city felt more emphatic\, and the combat even feels refined and exciting. The boss fights are tense but rewarding\, and general combat is fun and rather challenging as well. I've heard some critics complain about the game's world\, but i personally find it to just be brimming with excitement\, and the city leaves a huge impression on you even after the game is finished. Hell\, even looking at the city alone is worth it\, because the game's visuals are spectacular: the city is beautiful\, the game is brimming with color\, and the cinematics are well-designed\, too. The gameplay is varied\, the storyline is emotional and fantastic in how it deals with themes of hard choices\, and the characters are as charming and lovable as you remember (I especially like the dynamic between Peter and MJ's relationship\, it's so easy to root for them).There's not much I can complain about here\, this is easily one of my favorite games of the year\, and one of the best superhero games I've ever played. It more than eclipses \""Spider-Man 2\,\"" it sets a new standard for Marvel games that many future games may struggle to reach (well\, except the potential sequels\, but still). From a film standpoint\, \""Homecoming\"" and\, recently\, \""Into the Spider-Verse\"" seem to be proving that Spidey's still kicking and avoiding franchise fatigue\, and this game does little to dispel that notion: it only proves that Spidey's hitting on all cylinders now. If you haven't gotten to play this game yet...well\, what are you waiting for? Go play it!Final rating: 10 out of 10 \""Fantastic\""… Expand",true

73251,MSMPS4,2018-10-08,9,"This game brings us perhaps the best Spider-man's adaptation to video games. Insomniac captured the essence of the character perfectly. Combat system is really fun\, they took references from the Arkham Series\, is pretty obvious\, but they adapted that system to Spider-man and it feels so good to fight with him\, natural and smooth\, combining movements and gadgets making combats very satisfying. The web swinging is amazing\, simple and pleasant\, you never get bored of going from a place to another. The story is decent\, must say a little too predictable for me but it has some good plot twists. The reasons why I'm giving it a 9\, is because\, first of all\, I'm tired of the \""Ubisoft towers\""\, these high points that let you discover all the important points of a zone in the city\, 'cause when you activate them all the map looks like a rainbow\, every mission\, every collectible\, every important location is a point on the map. I've seen this in games like The division and must say I'm not a big fan of it because it makes me feel like I'm doing tasks with absolute no sense and sometimes it gets bothering to do them. Secondly\, I don't know if this is considered a spoiler\, but in some parts of the game we have to control other characters besides Spider-Man\, and personally\, I think these were the worst parts of the game. Because they're boring\, tiring and it really breaks the experience in a horrible way; fortunately they're not so many and they are kinda short\, so is not that bad. I really had a good time playing this game\, is really funny\, animations and movements are spectacular\, graphically speaking is very good\, despite what people said about a downgrade\, to me it looks amazing even in a PS4 fat\, and the level of detail on some aspects is incredible. If you have a PS4 and you're a fan of the spider\, I recommend you the game 100%\, it's not perfect or revolutionary\, it takes a lot of tools and aspects from other games in the genre\, but this is for me\, one of the best games of this year so far.

On the other side of that coin\, evasion is less of an 'insta-counter' than Arkham games\, and deliberate thought needs to be put into your timing as your Spidey Sense tingles.Now for the real question: how's the web-slinging?  Easy: more reactive\, responsive\, and fun than ever.  Trying not to wear out the Arkham analogies (because the game is markedly different from the Arkham games in some core areas)\, but while a game like Arkham City is a combat-focused action game with a minor focus on open-world action/adventure gameplay\, Spidey is an open-world action/adventure game with a minor focus on combat-focused action gameplay.  Getting the hang of taking off\, wall-runnung\, free-falling\, web stunts\, web-zipping\, and everything in-between to pick up speed is where the game feels like it's at its strongest.  In terms of core gameplay\, QTEs do rear their ugly head from time to time\, but for the first time in Spider-Man\, they are used a little more sparingly.Playing on Spectacular difficulty has given me a new appreciation for the game as well: if you happen to get roughed up by a gang of thugs early on - which can and will happen on Spectacular difficulty - you lose the encounter\, but you gain the experience for whatever enemies you did beat\, and you just checkpoint out of the encounter until a new crime needs to be stopped.  I have to commend Insomniac for trying to create a game that can be so accessible to low-level players but also provide high-level challenge without trying to actively punish people who seek out said challenges.  Collectibles are shown to you in an organic way with a more streamlined version of the Ubisoft tower system that doesn't turn collecting into a chore\, as well: and if you prefer hunting for backpacks on your own\, as long as you don't ping the area with the right analog stick\, they remain un-illuminated.The story\, like Arkham City\, is pure fanservice\, but not in a bad way.  It's clearly a labor of love\, and Insomniac's more seasoned Spider-Man feels like a welcome change and a completely new addition to a Spider-verse that typically has an unhealthy obsession with continuity reboots.Bottom line: if you don't like Spider-Man\, this game may or may not change your mind.  But if you've got  any love for the wall-crawler\, or even for superhero games in general\, the words 'must-play' absolutely spring to mind.… Expand",true

He shoots out of the web very quickly\, but then his motion slows to a crawl about a quarter of a second after he lets go\, meaning none of that fast-paced momentum based swinging like in Spiderman 2's movie tie in game.

Combat is fun and innovative and it's great because you can handle the situation in many different ways. Ether play it safely and sneakily take down people or just go all out mayhem. You also get many different gadgets\, skills and suits to mix things up and it's done perfectly. The story and the characters are also great.

IMarvel's Spider-man has an excellent narrative for anyone tired of the same origin story retold over and over again. However\, after getting around my love for the web-slinging spider I got to notice all the flaws fans seem to miss. Don't get me wrong it a great experience for a spider-man fan\, the web-slinging is great but not perfect.The combat is incredibly repetitive and easy. I found myself creating the same moves over and over again\, even as i got into the latter parts of the game. it went from dodging to smashing the attack button to pressing triangle to go to the next enemy and repeat. I found not much of a reason to upgrade my skill tree after a while. Though I strangely liked this better than the Batman Arkham games.The graphics don't seem as good as i thought as they would be. After hearing about the whole puddle controversy digital foundry confirmed that the graphics had actually gotten an upgrade but I am not seeing any improvements. The character models are fine with the exceptions on Peter. I am not one to usually pick on a game for its graphics cause that's not a game's main strength but I couldn't get over Peter's strange design\, specifically his eyes. Mary Jane also seems to lack the design I remembered from comics and cartoon series as she is more of an average looking redhead with Lois Lane traits instead of the girl next door bombshell.As for the story\, if you play other PS4 exclusive games then you can probably see the similar formula. As they try hard to copy the same cinematic experience you see when you go to a movie theater. Not a bad thing but when it becomes a consistent trend I fear more games will follow this practice and prioritize it over gameplay. I was also disappointed in the lack of villain fights during the game\, they weren't many and the early ones felt more like a tutorial than actual boss fights. Black Cat's mission was anti-climatic\, the side quest were hardly challenging and the MJ/Miles segments were unnecessary.While I love playing as Spider-man I do wish there more choices to play as him rather than follow a linear scripted narrative\, but that's just me. I'm sure a lot of people loved the quirky humor and laughable segments with Spider-man and Yuri or the J.J. podcast. Overall I liked this game but it isn't a 10/10 just because of the graphics and easy clone combat of Arkham. It isn't a bad game and it definitely isn't a masterpiece but it does need improvement.

Wait for it to drop to $20-30.Full review:I spent the entire weekend playing this game. I've played most every Spider-Man game since the NES\, and I think I even played the DOS version back in the day. Several have been horrible. This one is just meh. It's not a Amazing (pun intended)\, but it's not trash.  The main reason I play Spider-Man games anymore is to see Venom and /or Green Goblin.  This game has neither.What this game does have is an SJW coating.  Almost every new character is a person of color.  The only exceptions I saw were a guy with a man bun whose ethnicity I could not determine\, a cop who was a jerk\, and a football player\, who again\, was a jerk.  Luckily they didn't race/gender swap any existing characters.  It also appears that they intentionally hired unattractive actors as Mary Jane is a square jawed\, plump faced\, ginger without any sex appeal whatsoever.  Aunt May isn't meant to be a sex symbol\, but she looks like a crack whore in this game.  Peter just doesn't look like Peter to me\, but he's the least offensive of the main protagonists.The main story is too short.  All the side missions\, backpacks\, etc. pad it well\, but I was able to get 80+ percent in every area after about 25 hours\, and I think you could do just the main story in 10.The story deviates widely from any of the comics.  It's an interesting take\, but the scene after the credits made me strongly dislike the story as a whole.  Without spoiling anything\, it appears that two characters will be combined in the next game.  Looking back on it\, the story feels like a Rian Johnson wannabe\, where expectations were subverted but not in a good way.I would always sigh in frustration every time I was forced to play as anyone other than Peter.  I don't like the Miles Morales story line from the comics\, and his inclusion in this game just feels forced.  Now\, there was one section where you get to see Spider-Man in the background doing his thing\, and that was pretty fun and creative\, but just sneaking around is very counter intuitive to what I expect from an action game.  I don't play metal gear solid because I don't wanna hide in the dark\, I wanna run up and punch people.Now for the good.  The combat\, albeit almost too easy on normal\, is very satisfying.  Being able to turn off quick time event prompts\, button mashes\, and tedious brain teasers was much appreciated.  The web swinging never got boring for me.  It was nice that with the exception of a few areas\, I never had a problem with finding something to swing from.  This has been frustrating in other SM games.  Wall crawling around corners or trying to jump off a building was a little clunky\, but overall it was easy to traverse the city\, and it never felt like a chore.The graphics are top notch.  Detail put into office buildings and apartments is great.  Looking through a window you could even see action figures sitting on shelves.  Due to the unattractive actors\, I almost wish the graphics weren't so good.  With the exception of hair\, faces are lifelike.  Some of the boss fights are stunning\, but the main or co-main villain fights have too much dialogue.  It causes the story to lag and lose weight.  The long section that was shown at e3 was the best part of the game in my opinion\, and I was sad that it was spoiled for me beforehand.  All the boss fights were far too easy on normal.  Perhaps doing side activities leveled me up too much\, but I didn't just run around doing everything before doing the story missions either.With respect to the glowing reviews this game is receiving\, there is a disturbing trend lately where mediocre games are called masterpieces.  I love games\, I love Insomniac games\, and I liked this game\, but if I was gonna replay one from this series\, it would be Ultimate Spider-Man.  Maybe my nostalgia goggles are on\, but that game had a great art style\, a story that was faithful to the comics\, great web swinging\, and Venom and Carnage.  I wouldn't even say that game is a masterpiece.  It's a solid 8/10.… Expand",true

Once I saw thieves rob the exact same store for the fourth time I decided to avoid side content when possible and stick to the main story when possible.The story itself while decent could use some work. This game starts out slow and reaches a peak during the last 5 or so missions. The side character stealth missions are enjoyable if nothing new. The spider-man missions are fun at times but tend to get repetitive due to the game's combat. The combat in the game is Arkham's combat with almost no modification. The main difference is that you have a web shooter that can incapacitate all enemy types provided their on the floor. Nothing new is really added and the game mainly just adds more enemies as the game goes on. All early missions follow a strict formula where you either fight enemies or do some stealth takedowns from above (this is taken from the Arkham series as well). Stealth gameplay is pretty basic so it loses it's charm after the first few times. The main story gets a bit better at the end when it goes into bigger set pieces instead of repeated content used over and over again\, however this makes up only about 15-10% of the story overall so the main campaign could have used a bit more polish.This game may be worth playing if you really like spider-man (which I do)\, but as a game it doesn't do anything really well or interestingly so for most there are other games that are better worth your money.… Expand",true

It feels satisfying to hit someone and figuring out ways to use your gadgets and the environment to build up your combo counter is a lot of fun!That being said\, it's not a perfect game and I don't feel like it completely deserves the 9's and 9.5's or higher that most professional reviewers gave it. It has a lot of great points for sure. Good graphics\, voice acting\, character models\, sound design combat and\, like I mentioned\, swinging through the city. But a lot of things also sucked the enjoyment out of the game for me.My biggest pet peeves have to be the forced stealth based story mission where you play as either MJ or Miles. I can remember one or two missions that were tense and had me on the edge of my seat...but most of them just brought the pacing down of what is an exciting\, superhero adventure.Aside from that\, it suffers from the same routine as a lot of open world game. Go to a tower\, free up a section of the map\, see where collectibles and missions are. Traversing through New York via your webs doesn't make this as much of a chore\, fortunately. But a lot of side-content\, especially when it comes to beating up Thugs and other nasties that pop up later in the game IS a chore. The Research Stations probably offer the most variety\, as do the normal Side Quests. Though I do wish the latter was more exciting and had you deal with more of the enemies in Spider-Man's Rogue's Gallery. Especially later on in the game.Taking enemies out the stealthy way also isn't really rewarding. The mooks don't react in a satisfying way\, like they do in the Arkham games were they become scared and unpredictable. And it's pretty useless when you are doing Base missions where the second wave appears and spots you immediately.Boss fights also tend to follow a pattern\, but they are fun and exciting at least. That being said\, I do wish said Bosses got more time to shine. Near the end of the game some of Spider-Man's more famous villains pop up...and they get very little screen time before they face you two at a time. Meaning that you wipe out four out of the six baddies relatively quickly.Only two of the villains really get a chance to shine and it is done well! Especially the main villain. You\, the player\, probably know who he is and that you will eventually face him. But the game did an excellent job of making you wonder:\""But when is the reveal going to come for Spider-Man?\""All in all\, Insomniac did a fantastic job handling Spider-Man. It has its fault\, but the game feels great to play and it tells an amazing story with good characters. It definitely managed to tug at my heartstrings too\, especially the last few scenes.My only complaint about the story has to be the whole romantic subplot that's going on with MJ and Peter. Mainly because the arguments they have have been done to death in almost every other movie\, comic\, book\, tv-show or videogame when it's about dating a superhero. But it seems to have been resolved\, so hopefully I won't be bothered by that in a possible sequel.Because I HOPE we get a sequel!… Expand",true

It is a very well rounded experience with fun immersive combat\, a great story\, and top notch visual and sound design.The gameplay is mostly excellent; movement through the city is fast\, fun and feels natural. Spider-man responds and interacts with the environment in a fairly believable way running and jumping off of walls is fluid and responsive. The downside of traversal is that there are some areas that Spider-man gets stuck or can’t climb around corners on walls and it feels unnatural and jarring. Combat is very fun and fast paced\, there are lots of ways to interact with enemies and make use the environment. The downside is that combat doesn’t really evolve as much as in other action adventure games. While you do unlock new abilities very few of them offer major changes to how you fight. There are a reasonable number of enemy types and the level of challenge is rewarding but combat does get repetitive. The boss battles are all pretty good but few stand out as exceptional. The puzzle sections of the game are fun at first but they do get repetitive by the end. Some stealth sections are a bit of chore. The menus are good and easy to navigate; my only complaint about the menu is that the text is too small in some areas. Overall there is nothing terribly bad about the gameplay it is consistently solid but there are some weak areas that it could be improved.The story is one of the best in a superhero game. I would say that it is a better story than the movies offer. The plot unfolds at a good pace and there are new elements introduced regularly to keep things interesting. It is well balanced with a mix of drama\, action and humor\, all complimenting each other and rarely feeling forced. It does a good job of filling in background information about the plot through phone conversations and Jameson’s radio show. These take place while traversing the city and are never really intrusive. There are a few moments in the story that are poorly explained and while there are some good twists few of them were amazing or deep. I was rarely surprised but most of the big moments were still satisfying. The conclusion didn’t disappoint and still a lot of ideas open to be explored in sequels.There have been countless games set in cities and many set in New York but this is one of the best versions of the city I have seen. It totally captures the feeling of being Spider-man. Many iconic New York landmarks are present but there are also many fictional buildings as well. While most of the game is set outside there are some really great interior locations. Most of the locations are crafted with care and attention to detail. Every section of the city has good number of activities and story events to experience. My only complaint about the world is that there is a lot of repetition\, many hideouts all look the same. Interactivity is good but environments in other games offer more destructibility and interaction.There is a large cast of characters and nearly all of them are well written and developed. Peter goes through a great arc and feels authentic. I liked this version of the character better than any of the movie versions. MJ also has a good story and feels like a real person with her own motives. The villains are a bit of a mixed bag\, some of them are pretty flat with minimal development. I found the back stories of the villains could have been more fleshed out but each of them has their own motives and none are as simple as doing evil for evil’s sake. The side characters are fleshed out well enough to make them believable. Every character adds something to the story.The game looks almost as good as a movie\, the characters\, environments\, colors\, lighting and designs all seem authentic to the Spider-man universe. Like most open world games\, there is a bit too much visual repetition and there are some areas of the game that look a bit generic but it does far better than most and almost nothing in the game looks bad.Great voice acting\, great sound effects and a sound track that feels true to the Spider-man experience. My one complaint about the sound is the music is a bit generic\, there aren’t many memorable tracks or moments were the music is moving. With that said the music never gets in the way either\, it always seemed to compliment what was happening.This is definitely one the longest Spider-man games and it offers a good blend of main story and side content. The story is around 15 hours with the side content offering another 10+ hours. A lot of the side content is repetitive but there is quite often some small story aspect attached to it. Phone conversations with side characters make generic quests a bit more interesting.I give it 85%… Expand",true
