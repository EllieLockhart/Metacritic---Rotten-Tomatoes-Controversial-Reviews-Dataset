For me\, one of the main reasons is that this game has not managed expectations properly and the marketing campaign was wrong.I don’t know about you guys\, but before this game was released I read quite a bit about it in my videogames magazines and it was always sold as a 3rd person shooter. Well\, the thing is\, that for me isI get why people is giving such crappy scores to this game. For me\, one of the main reasons is that this game has not managed expectations properly and the marketing campaign was wrong.I don’t know about you guys\, but before this game was released I read quite a bit about it in my videogames magazines and it was always sold as a 3rd person shooter. Well\, the thing is\, that for me is not a pure 3rd person shooter (let’s say as Uncharted or Tomb raider)\, and it was advertised as one. So yes\, If you go and buy this game expecting the see the next uncharted or whatever you will be massively disappointed.So what is this game? I’d say is somewhere between Until dawn kind of games and Uncharted. It has a bit of Until Dawn in terms of the game being focused on a story rather than on game play. This means you’ll have quite a few cut-scenes\, some of them long and quite a bit of the action is in the form of QTEs. It is just a bit like Until dawn\, because it is obviously not so good at giving you choices of what to say or to do (actually it gives you none). On the other hand is a bit like uncharted\, meaning you have some really good shootouts (the mechanics are really good) but then there is no plataforming at all. So summarising\, that’s why I said is a bit between Uncharted and until dawn\, it is none of them but something in between. The order is a story driven game\, where you walk around a bit and you take control for the shooting. This means the game is not great as an adventure like game (e.g. until dawn) and not great as a shooter (e.g. Uncharted) but what’s good is very good.The setting is awesome and I am not talking about the graphics (and yes\, they are very enjoyable). I am talking about the atmosphere as a whole. It is kind of a bit realistic\, mixed with fantasy\, very dark\, simply a great universe. The story and the characters are good\, not awesome but quite good\, much better than in most thriller movies. The shooting mechanics are very well implemented; shooting feels good\, and very enjoyable and using the right kind of weapon makes a difference I think.So yes\, if you know what you’re against when you get this game\, I think you’ll find it very enjoyable. If you are expecting a very specific genre (3rd person shooter) you’ll be disappointed because it is just not that. It is not a masterpiece and it is quite average as a 3rd person shooter or an adventure game but it is quite good as a weird mixture of those two genres.… Expand"

Unfortunately it's only aiming as high as \""graphical powerhouse\"" and not \""great game.\""It's painful to come down hard on this game\, since I imagine it was rushed out to function as a launch exclusive for the PS4.  And\, boy\, did that console need some games in the early days.  But this game needed more time\, if at least to tighten up the gameplay a bit.  As it is\, this game is simply not fun to play.Credit where credit is due: the visuals in this game are amazing and still outshine most anything seen today.  Sure it's only 30 fps\, but the richly detailed environments rarely repeat assets.  You can tell that an object in the distance is made of glass or stone based on how light hits it.  And for the first time ever\, subtle facial animations convey subtext during conversations.Yet at all turns the game distracts you from its own presentation.  The plodding speed at which you move through the world will make you want to pull your hair out--until the games hampers you further during certain sequences.  You'll face corridor after corridor of cover-based monotony--only to die from a sudden quick time event.  And the amount of screen space your character takes up\, blinding you to your surroundings.The only other part that is great is the world-building and presentation of the story--even if the story itself is frustratingly standard.  All the voice acting is great\, and the writing is pretty good most of the time.  But the story just doesn't have enough heart to get you to really care.  And while I would have loved to see more of this story\, the way the game leans into its abrupt cliffhanger ending is laughable.… Expand"

It is hard to rate\, but I ve given it a 7/10. Read on if you want to know more about it.It has taken me quite some time to finally grab The Order 1886 at a reasonable discount. I played it on my PS4 Pro SSD and encountered no bluescreens\, bugs or frame issues at all besides of a tiny sequence later in the game. The engine does quite some magic and besides its age the game delivers outstanding graphical atmosphere\, intense sound and really good voice acting.I will not spoil the story but I personally liked it a lot. I think it is well developed but nothing too outstanding. The characters are nicely placed within the world but do not have enough time to rise because the game itself is rather short. I think its easily finishable in a 5hr slot and might take 7 to 10hrs at most. The gunplay is really good with a decent amount of arsenal to play with consisting of rifles\, snipers\, shotguns\, smgs\, revolvers and special weapons I wont spoil here. The visual and sound effects in gunplay are fun and suit the weapons you wield pretty accurate.Gameplay consist of few core features: quick time events\, walking simulator\, movie sequence and action sequences. Some clever mechanics are included also in the game but do not play a significant role. All the other core parts might share equal parts. You could considere The Order more as interactive movie with stealth accents\, if I were to quote it in a single line.Why only 7/10 you might ask now? It is really hard to explain because the game does everything right in certain areas deserving a plain 10/10 but the short length after all and the heavy cutscenes within this short period deserve at least a minus of 1 or 2. Besides that some controls are clunky. They are not bad at all and you will get used to it but the switching between weapons and control schemes onto quick time events are sometimes annoying and will lead to frustrating moments. Also the encounters are often pretty bland and it is more of enduring waves of enemies then intelligent gunplay.My summary is that I m glad that I finally tried out THe Order 1886 considering there will be a successor and it will hopefully take the good parts and enhance the improveable ones to a great game experience. Visually the game is outstanding for its age. I liked the story and the characters. Gameplay is smooth and gunplay is mostly fun. Grab this short but worthwhile game experience at a discount of at least 50 to 80% in regards to the retail price and I think you will make a nice deal with some enjoyable moments.… Expand"

Voice acting is all real good. Didn’t really notice the music.•There are collectibles in assorted items you can look at which are ok\, and then pictures and audio that are both super boring. After a while I just gave up listening to em\, so maybe I missed something cool but I highly doubt it.Overall: I enjoyed it. Not a ton\, but it’s definitely worth the time.

It is in no way a bad game\, but it is in no way a great game either. Even though the visuals are aging\, it still looks very nice. The gameplay for the most part is good\, although there are some useful mechanics that could be here. I would have liked a simple evade move to use at any time\, and not limited to when a live grenade is nearby. Perhaps the ability to throw grenades back at the enemies who cast them towards you would also have been cool. I also hated the times when I was not allowed to sprint. And this thing is more of a nit-pick\, but the option to be able to toss a pebble or something towards a wall to lure guards to you would have been nice. With the advanced weaponry you can use in the game\, being able to throw a rock at a wall doesn't seem implausible. What is a big problem  is not that there are QTEs\, but such an over-reliance on them. If there were fewer of them and they were more spread out then  I could forgive their inclusion  much more. They were just annoying. And I would have really liked to be able to track the collectibles and inspected items that are found along the way. It's very frustrating having to go through chapters after completing the game and inspecting everything in hopes that I haven't just to get the trophies I need. That is especially when you cannot skip a single cutscene even after you beat the game. To be fair though this game seems really easy when it comes to acquiring a platinum trophy\, which is what I intend to do. The story in my opinion isn't bad but the longer I played\, the less interested I became in it. It tends to drag and being forced to sit through the cutscenes doesn't help with that. And the overall ending of the game was kind of abrupt even though I completed it in two separate playthroughs. The weapons in the game are very fun to use\, and the Blacksight ability is helpful when you're in a tight spot. Many people have said that the game could have used a multiplayer mode of some sort. I don't disagree with that\, but I think giving the limited presence that the Lycans have in the game\, a horde mode would have been a brilliant move. You could play it alone or with another player locally\, and maybe up to four people online. Aside from going through the levels to find the things that you missed\, there's not a ton of replay value here at all. I wasn't really sure I wanted to play it around the time it originally released\, but I think it's worth a go at the price it's at now should you choose to buy it digitally. I prefer to buy physically but I didn't really care to get a hard copy of this. In conclusion\, it's not a bad game at all and doesn't deserve the rep it gets. Without giving anything away\, the ending does seem to set up a sequel. It'd be nice to get one and if so I personally would like them to pick up the pace a little. Not too much\, but so it's not a slog to get through.… Expand"

I can imagine had I spent the full amount of a game like this\, I'd've probably felt somewhat shortchanged.  It isn't lengthy\, it is largely a cinematic-driven experience\, and unless you are hunting for the collectibles then there's little-to-no replay value.  However\, I paid about half price for it (gotta love a good deal when it comes along)\, so those feelings don't exist for me.The Order is very different from other games of its kind.  It plays from the third-person perspective\, but it isn't like its contemporaries like Gears of War or Mass Effect.  There's no leveling up.  No Horde Mode.  Nothing but a 6-10 hour campaign (again\, this depends on how much you explore) with a pretty fair amount of firefights and investigating coupled with a hefty amount of cutscenes.  I suppose the best comparison I can make is by putting it side-by-side with Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.  Ironically\, despite a very similar structure\, this game has met far more criticism than the PS2 classic\, which is odd to me considering just how short MGS 2 happens to be.  Yes\, in hindsight a lot of people have come along poking fun at the Metal Gear franchise for its heavy use of cutscenes\, but I don't think it has faced any real backlash for its structure.  Quite the contrary\, when the first Metal Gear released it was met with praise about how its cinematic structure set it apart and innovated video games for all time.  And so it did.  Metal Gear deserves the praise it has received.The Order\, perhaps because it lacks the cool boss fights of the MGS series\, has received no such praise despite the similarities.  It has been treated as though it is a failure.  A too-short game that there is little reason to play.  This is simply not true.  I wouldn't go so far as to call the game great\, because yes\, its length does hinder such a claim\, but this is a very strong title that is well worth playing if one is willing to pay a smaller price than $60 for it.  It is short\, yes\, but so are the Walking Dead games by Telltale\, or rather every game by Telltale.  Those games are considered classics.  If viewed in a similar lens\, The Order is kind of like playing a Telltale game but one that has more interaction to it and far more shooting.  Now\, with Telltale games we are obviously getting a great story (most of the time\, at least)\, so is the same true with The Order?  Absolutely.  In fact\, I would say that the story is perhaps the game's greatest strength\, although its visuals are a pretty spectacular draw as well\, but it is the story that really kept me moving and excited.  The lore that Ready At Dawn has created in The Order is one I found to be very interesting and very appealing to a large audience.  A modern spin on Arthur's Knights of the Round Table mixed with werewolves\, vampires\, a bit of Jack the Ripper\, and a bit of an ode even to Sherlock Holmes.  I love little touches like that\, or ones such as holy water from the Holy Grail itself enabling the Knights to live for hundreds of years.  Cool stuff\, in my opinion.Look\, I know there are going to be plenty of people that come away from The Order disappointed.  It's natural to see a game of a certain ilk and have certain expectations\, but all I can say is that those typical expectations should be left at the door because you aren't going to get a heavy dose of what you usually get from games that look like The Order.  But\, if you are willing to give it a chance and accept it for what it is\, you may find yourself very pleasantly surprised by a truly fun and unique gaming experience.  I know I was.Rating: 8.5/10… Expand"

The more I played I was no longer in shock at the detail (although it never ceases to be anything other than incredible) but that so many people and reviewers alike seem to have missed the point of The Order and in doing so squandered a fabulous experience.Set in the Victorian era surrounding the trials and often supernatural tribulations of a group of knights the story has some dramatic highs and lows\, very much like that of a good Hollywood blockbuster – the mo-cap is excellent\, voice work is strong and the animation and modelling of the characters is exemplary. There were occasions for me where my jaw dropped\, when a combination of lighting\, particle effects and the scene unfolding in front of me meant I just had to pause where I was to appreciate the amount of effort that has gone into making this game. Overall the story is fairly by the numbers but it was nevertheless enjoyable and sitting back watching the cutscenes let the treachery unfold is a delight I never got tired of.As with the voice acting the rest of the sound is of a high quality\, guns have a satisfying “boom” and clatters and clinks of doors and objects all hit the mark. Musically there is much to enjoy\, a strong score that increases the tension when things get hectic but also do a good job of the subtler moments\, it’s never intrusive or over the top.As mentioned already the game is a graphical tour-de-force\, it’s been a while (at least before moving to current gen) that I’ve been blown away by how a game looks\, even character details like eyes and the fact characters even have nose hair (!) are all done to such a high degree it’s hard to see how they can be improved upon. Settings are rich and do a wonderful job of dragging you into the characters and story\, giving a real sense of the time and the situations faced.The controls whilst a little clunky work well\, I never experienced any deaths that weren’t through my own ignorance. The guns all have their own amounts of recoil\, reloading times etc. which help differentiate them and the reactions of wounded enemies appear to be varied and realistic. The QTEs aren’t as common occurrence as you’ve likely been lead to believe and often work during scenes where it is difficult to imagine how it could be dealt with any other way – nobody seems to care (me included) the WB Batman series rely on a set of simple button inputs to generate a plethora of different attacks or to open doors/grates\, I don’t see how The Order is greatly different in many respects.The Order 1886 is a game best played at a leisurely place\, to do otherwise means to kind of miss the point – this is not a game of huge scope\, nor are you meant to delve into every nook or and cranny available to you – but\, should you decide to stop for a moment and look around you cannot be anything other than impressed by what a great job the developer has done to bring the sights and sounds of that era to the people – picking up a new gun\, why not stop and see the detail of the engraving and appreciate how the designer has incorporated a Victorian degree of practicality to an otherwise modern weapon – use the photo mode and look at the sneers on your enemies faces\, the muzzle flashes and the scene all reflecting in a muddy puddle…That people have chosen to complain about the length of The Order 1886\, the control being taken away from them and it’s mostly linear progression shows that they have completely missed the point – this game is a fantastic experience that lets you get into hectic gunfights but then sit back and watch the characters deliberate whilst the story unfolds\, all this is dripping with impeccable detail and a level of understanding and design very rarely witnessed in the era of annual franchises and copy/paste shooters… I for one loved The Order 1886 and my only complaint is having to wait until the story continues…… Expand"

The characters are okay\, there are only a couple I actually like\, but heyo. That's more of a neutral point. The gunplay is largely satisfying\, with some guns feeling genuinely very powerful and fun to use. As the game drags on the combat does get rather tiresome\, though.Time for the bad. I have a whoooole lot of big and little things wrong with this game. Let's start with the story. The elephant in the room with this game is that the story only clocks in at around 5-6 hours\, and considering the game has absolutely zero replay value or side modes outside of the story\, that's absolutely unforgivable for a AAA game that retailed for the price it did. Not only this\, but even though the game lasted that short a time\, I feel like the narrative was dragged out far longer than it should have been\, by the 10th chapter (of 15\, if I recall correctly) I was already thinking \""is this gonna end soon? I hope it does\"" which is never a good sign. I will admit though it's impressive to only have 5/6 hour campaign and still make it feel like it's dragging on. Nice job\, Ready At Dawn.Let's get to the problems with the gameplay. I did mention that the gunplay was satisfying\, and while that is true\, the actual gameplay sequences (including combat) outside of just walking around doing **** all until you get to your objective\, are far too few and far between. In the first half of the game this is particularly apparent\, with the game seemingly wanting to wrestle control from you at any point it can\, with it swapping to a cutscene for the most pointless **** This game has a serious problem with interactivity and people who have played the game will know exactly what I mean. And despite the combat sequences being few and far between\, by the end sequences of the game combat just becomes a chore to slog through to get to the next cutscene\, and they tend to drag on for 10+ minutes at a time with enemies constantly flooding in and spawning in seemingly until the level designers got bored on placing enemies and decided to move on. The combat sections just feel rather lazily crafted most of the time because of stuff like that\, and most of the sequences just feel like padding.A small gripe of the story\, or specifically the writing is how obviously unaware the characters are of the narrative and other characters. There was more than one point in the game where Galahad (the protagonist) was told the same piece of information twice\, and still managed to be confused on the second time. A glaring example of this is when we find out the reason one of the characters trusts us is because of their alliance with another character\, and Galahad and the player and clearly told and communicated this\, yet when the character mentions it later on\, Galahad is totally ****ing befuddled by it.The difficulty of the game is also a glaring issue. For most of the game\, the combat is unbelievably easy. Enemies can go down in a single shot if you're even slightly familiar with a controller\, and the only enemies that don't are the shotgun types. The shotgun enemies are not challenging because they are well crafted\, they are only challenging because their weapons are ****ing broken. At several points I had them shooting at me through thick walls and killing me in only one or two hits. Not only this\, but they have an unbelievable amount of health\, which makes the imbalance they have over the player that much worse. The difficulty\, or lack thereof\, is also a problem in the total of TWO ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL boss battles throughout the game. These two short lived battles are essentially glorified quick-time events\, and even though you are forced to feel threatened by them\, the actual fights are so easy that it's genuinely laughable.Let's talk about the bad side of the visuals though. There is only really one big problem I have. The black bars used to obscure the top and the bottom of the screen for 'cinematic effect'. Not only is this a total cop out for the lack of power in the PS4 to get this to run at a full 1080p\, but it also becomes a HUGE burden on the player during combat. Working together with the absolutely tiny field of view the player gets\, you are almost always completely unaware of your surroundings when in cover in combat\, as the camera hangs so low and close to Galahad.While the controls are fine for the most part\, during some combat segments the controls got in the way of me getting out of the way of harm\, and when Galahad is sprinting turning is almost impossible\, so I found myself more than once trying to sprint away from enemy fire only to run headfirst into the bullets and subsequently either dying or losing most of my health.I wanted to like this\, I really did.

The Order: 1886 is a beautiful game. The game is worth checking out for the reason alone. The beauty is not only in the wonderful character animations and textures\, but also in how the levels are set up and presented. Melee animations make amazing use of the space\, with the protaginist smoothly bashing heads against tables or pulling enemies over cover. The atmosphere is every bit gritty\, steam punk alternative history London. There are more than a few easter eggs for anglophiles. The story is also above par for a video game\, and by the end you'll feel the protagonists melancholy.The game play in The Order: 1886 is the obvious weak spot. Characters are animated well\, but not smooth enough for top tier gameplay. For example\, the protagonist turns so slowly that in one winding hallway\, couldn't not turn him fast enough to prevent him from scraping against the wall. As another example\, when the protagonist rejuvenates himself from near death\, he rises so slowly that he will more often than not be killed instantly before you can snap him back into cover. Speaking of cover\, the protagonists sticks so closely to cover when in cover mode that it takes a few seconds to pull him back out. If you were hoping to quickly sneak around some enemies\, then too bad. This is outlandish considering games had all but perfected the cover mechanic in the last generation of console games.The worst of the gameplay mechanics are the quick time events\, where you have to press the correct button in a short period of time to avoid instant death. I never like quick time events. Good gameplay falls into a flow\, where the player knows what buttons to press and the rhythm for pressing them. The Order: 1886 will take an action such as a punch that is controlled with the triangle button and then make that button a square or circle in a quick time event. What should be smooth game play turns into a guessing game. The system seems arbitrary and I believe it is. The lack of forethought really shows when a quick time event is combined with moving a cursor to pre-determined target. Though I play with the Y axis inverted\, the cursor mode is not inverted. The protagonists died several times because of this.All in all\, though\, the frustrations in the controls were minimial. Even the great Read Dead: Redemption had its quirky gun fights and the utterly adequate Tomb Raider reboot threw in a few quick time actions. The Order: 1886 could have greatly benefited from a standard quick time battle scheme that differed less from the regular running and gunning.As for the running and gunning\, the first shooting aspect of this game is excellent. The guns are fun\, but I note there is an option DLC to add more weapons that really should have been included in the game. The appeal of a steam punk game is to use the alternate history steam punk weapons\, not using the same kinds of weapons that exist in all other games. At some point\, the shooting devolves into a Call of Duty clone much in the same was as the Tomb Raider reboot. Every area has a set of chest high walls for cover\, and then the enemies will regularly toss out grenades to take you out of cover. Even on easy mode\, some of the enemies were a little too spammy with explosive weapons. Some battles are little more than shooting galleries\, with waves of enemies to mow down from an almost fixed position. Though there are a few stealth zones\, what this game badly needed was a mix of stealth and shooting.FYI\, I picked this game up for $10 during a Playstation Flash Sale. The game is also available for $20 from many retail outlets. Thus\, the this issue of price and the game's 8 hour length and lack of replayability has no bearing on this review. My playtime was almost exactly 8 hours. This is about the same as a Call of Duty or Halo. This is good and bad. The game isn't overly long and certainly is not padded. There are never any frustrating segments where you are lost on a map or have to double back for ammo. However\, the heavy use of cutscenes and slow dialogue only help tell the story the first time. On a second playthrough\, much of the game will be a slog\, at least if you play through it again immediately. This game is another good example of why I am always in favor of new game +.  And as noted\, the game now costs for less than it's original $60 price tag\, so the price versus hours played is not an issue.… Expand"

The visuals\, the design\, the animations\, it's top notch and  I mean really the best there is. It looks gorgeous. But the game itself is so so bad that it cannot be saved by the graphics. It is unforgivably bad. I have never seen a game with extremes like that before.So what is so unforgivably wrong with this game?the gameplay is ... outdated. Quicktime events are ok\, but not if your whole game consists of it. Basically the flow is \""walk here\, press triangle\, walk back\, press triangle\""\, cinematic \"" press triangle to continue the cinematic\"" . That with cowboy style shooter intermezzos in which you hide behind an object and shoot endless hordes of resembling enemies. There are even explosive barrels.But even that might be ok\, if it were solid gameplay. Instead the rules are not clear. sometimes you cannot hide behind random objects. sometimes you are not permitted to run. sometimes you can't switch weapons.Messing up one quicktime event results in instant death. The loading points are too scarce making you replay frustrating parts of the game over and over because of one mistake. The sneaking arae on the zeppelin is a good example of this. Not only did the game never introduce sneaking into its gameplay\, the minute the enemy spots you (which is hard to figure out when that is) you get shot in the head and can start all over again.Which brings me to the violence that is weirdly over the top and unnecessary. Look\, it's a shooter\, so killing is part of the play\, I get that\, but in this beautiful looking game with its story about righteousness it feels so out of place to brutally murder everyone you meet\, often in short scenes to show extra violence (like dramatically breaking someones neck with a loud crack\, or slicing the throat to make the blood spatter). Do I HAVE to murder everyone? All the personnel on the zeppelin\, were they so evil? The guy in the brothel\, what did he do? The game has creepy half-bred monsters for gods sake\, can't I focus the murdering on them? At a certain point in the game\, after massacring whole troops of rebels in a dehumanizing fashion\, the main characters ponder \""what if the rebels are right?\"". It feels so out of place.Character wise the game is interesting\, but the utter lack of female characters stands out\, especially when one of the few women in the game has worse facial animations than the great\, great majority of grey\, bearded old men. The characters can get very confusing. No one gets a real introduction with a backstory and apparently in 1886 90 percent of the population was a Caucasian\, bearded male lookalike. To make it even worse\, they all have at least three names (Isi\, Isabeau\, Igraine) and to make it even MORE worse\, halfway through the game one of the main characters takes over the name of another main character.The lack of overview shots (The zeppelin from outside? The crash?)\, the linearity (no you can't open this door if you haven't clicked X at the other door yet)\, the very tiny view frame\, it all makes this game a pain  to play.I understand that they wanted to make this a film like experience with the lack of interface\, the movie viewpoint\, the beautiful graphics.

I personally wasn't attached that much to the characters but I really liked the lore and stuck around. However\, if you detest this story\, you will HATE this game as it's more movie than game. (They even have black bars on the top and bottom.) Another problem with the order is that it has a couple of cool ideas but never lets you... have fun with them. For instance\, the lycans in the game barely appear and when they do it's a qte sequence. It's sad since the game should've used these sequences as survival horror or something. (Or at least have a scary cat and mouse sequence where you avoid an indestructible lycan or something?) Another problem is that the game has some cool ideas for weapons like a lightning gun or a poison/flamethrower mix-up but barely lets you play with them. Most of the time you're playing with a peashooter. Also this game is VERY linear and doesn't let you explore. Even wolfenstein (another linear game) had \""sandbox missions\"" levels that aren't open world but large enough that you can explore a bit and have fun and play in a variety of ways stealthy or guns blazing. The fifth(?) problem with the order is that you have to play the game WANTS you to play. If it's a shooting gallery you HAVE to play it like a shooting gallery. No creative approaches allowed. If it's a cliche stealth sequences you instantly die when caught. This game had a lot of potential and if the developers actually listen to feedback I believe that the sequel would be something good.

The first positive thing everybody brings up with this game are the graphics and how photorealistic they are. I find the graphics very nice looking but they are by far not the most realistic I have seen on the PS4. I find P.T. Silent Hills(2014) and Resident Evil 7: biohazard which will be releasing soon having much better graphics. I find the graphics very nice but the character models look very fake and cartoony compared to beautiful environments the game has created. The game features amazing environments from up in the sky in a blimp to the dirty mucky back alleys of London. The Lichen monsters are very well designed and creepy looking and are the the main villains of this game. I found the weapons also very cool and imaginative but found the gunplay too long and repetitive. I also did not like the stealth sections where if you are instantly seen you are killed right away. Though the Lichens are well designed looking they were a boring chore to fight. The game also recycles the same boss fight twice those are the only boss fights the game has. I found the story interesting but it ended at a bad sequel bait ending that left a bad taste in my mouth after the overall experience. A lot of people complain to me about the game’s length but I did not find the game too short. I believe that most games coming out lately especially in 2015 were too long. I enjoy playing short story focused campaigns in my games and The Order: 1886 definitely delivers that but faces a fair amount of technical problems. I give The Order: 1886 a 6/10.… Expand

Let's put it this way: the game has a beginning\, a climax\, but no resolution!\, the story doesn't end\, we are left with many unfinished and unanswered things that the game introduced that just never get resolved. On top of that while the world that the game sets-up is interesting\, the characters are not and the game is filled with so many cliches that make this story just so dreadful to witness that after the \""ending\""\, you will feel ripped-off.PRESENTATION: The Order's presentation is the best thing about the\, but it still has it's problems. First of\, the game is locked at 30fps which for a supposed \""new generation\"" is a complete rip-off\, not only that\, but the game also doesn't run at 1080p\, so the only way the developers figure out how to make up for this problems is to put 2 giant black bars on the screen that take up 30-40% of the screen (no joke).The music \,just like arkham knight is only used for atmosphere\, which makes it very forgettable. On the other hand\, the graphics do look pretty sweet\, BUT just like many other games\, for some reason that i don't know they\, once again sacrificed the color pallet for no reason (paradox)\, this leads to somethings looking very obscure and as a result some times you can't see where you're going because the game it's too ******* dark. Oh and there's Grey EVERYWHERE!!\, not black because that color is not on the ps4's color pallet\, but GREY!...GREY!!!.Plus the over amount of cutscenes make this game pretty ******* boring to play\, this is more of a movie than a game\, there's 127! minutes of cutscenes and 4 out of the 16 chapters are just you watching the \""game\""! and it's not like they're cutscenes of 1-2 minutes\, NO! there's more than 4 cutscenes that are 10 minutes long!. On top of that you can't skip cutscenes! not even on repeated playthroughs (if you even want to play this **** more than 1 time)\, why? you may ask\, simple! the game would be 4 hours long without them...that's great!\, isn't it?GAMEPLAY: I'm not gonna bother to explain how the gameplay mechanics work\, because it's just more of the same **** that we've seen over and over again (Gears of War gameplay)\, instead i'm going to say the \""new\"" stuff that it has. The game has a parkour system that (no joke) is the exact same as the one that uncharted 1-2-3 have!\, also the game has a \""slow down\"" feature\, but the game never tells you that\, so basically all we have left is the incredible amount of quicktime events (if you even consider it as a positive)\, the semi-decent variety of weapons and the \""recover\"" mechanic...when you are almost gonna die you press triangle and X a few times to stand up (That's it). This game really has nothing going for it and the gameplay gets very repetitive and boring very fast and that's just sad.In conclusion The Order 1886 is a BAD title that deserves every single amount of criticism that it gets\, because the only thing that the game has\, to save it from the 1 is the graphics\, but even does have it's problems since there are a number of low-res textures. So what we are left with is a game with a confusing and underdeveloped plot\, repetitive gameplay\, short length\, no replay value\, forgettable \""music\""\, cliché characters\, 2 hours of cutscenes\, unoriginal ideas\, over amounts of quicktime-events and dull \""new\"" gimmicks. With that said i'll give The Order 1886 a 3/10. Oh and did i mentioned that the 2 bosses that the game has are the exact same?.… Expand"

However\, The Order isn't a good game. In fact\, \""game\"" is pretty questionable in describing it. Game is suppose to be a form of playing\, sporting\, an activity or business\, meaning the \""player\"" is actually doing something. In The Order you're mainly watching cutscenes. The player agency is so far removed from this game that you even watch cutscenes of you walking to another place. Why on earth would they add extra cutscenes to show different point of views of someone walking? The one thing that the game did delivered on is the seamless quality of graphics from game play to cutscenes. The Graphics and detail are the best yet to be seen on next gen\, but you'll won't be able to wander around the city on your own and explore as you only traverse hall ways or corridors.It seems The Order has everything going for it to be a blockbuster game with its unique weapons; yet\, the shooting is in the form of gallery shooting. Take cover and shoot the enemy as they pop up their heads. The problem with the shooting also is that the camera is in so close that you are looking over your third-person protagonist's shoulder. With this type of close screen shot you are unable to get a good view of the surroundings that you need to clear of enemies. I had werewolves charging right at me\, but I didn't see them because my big head was in the way! I wished they would have pulled the view back so I could have decent sense of awareness. As you're walking around you'll find that you can't pull out your weapons\, aim or waste rounds. You don't have that ability until the actual shooting gallery starts. You'll generally fight with one other partner\, but they don't kill anybody.  You'll have to do all the killing as their rounds mysteriously  are in effective against the enemy.  Fighting werewolves turned out to be incredibly disappointing as you use the exact same method in order to dispatch them one at a time. Shoot them so many times\, quick-time-event. Sadly\, you don't deal with them much in this game\, as you'll spend more time walking corridors\, opening doors\, picking up and looking at objects. Yeah\, it's definitely not a thrill ride.I finished the story in about six hours on medium difficulty. I suppose if you don't mind not playing this as a game but as pushing buttons every once in a while to keep the story going\, broken up by small amounts of gallery shooting\, then you just might like this game. Since the \""game\"" mostly wants to be a movie\, I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this\, or better yet\, just rent it for the weekend. One thing is for certain\, QTE must die in this next generation. I understand it's used to give cinematic quality to final boss battles\, and those suck bad enough on their own.

Let's get to it.SO I have been waiting for this game since the teaser reveal at E3. A steampunk Victorian London with werewolves? Count me in I said. And so I waited. Was the wait worth it? Was the hype deserved? IS this game that good? Yes\, on all three.I have to admit that this game might not be for everyone. Those people that just want action without any exposition\, that just want to shoot stuff without any reason might be disappointed. This game is not about shooting\, it is about telling a story. Yes there is shooting\, but most importantly the story takes center stage. And I for one am so glad they decided to do this. Not only is the story interesting but the writing is top notch. I am talking Hollywood worthy writing. They talk like they are in 1886. But not just the story\, The audio is amazing\, you have to listen to these game with your headsets at full blast. Every punch of the rifle\, every grenade explosion sounds ultra realistic. And the soundtrack is what makes this all work. Dark and brooding the soundtrack makes you immerse yourself in the game.All that being said\, and to answer the polarizing statement around length. I would say this game is as long as it needed to be. I finished it on Hard in about 12 hours. If you have been gaming for a long time then you should start the game on Hard difficulty. If not you'll breeze trough it\, and maybe finish it in 5 hours. But why would you do that? Take your time\, immerse yourself\, enjoy the view.And for those that are comparing it to Gears of War  (My all time favorite game until I played The Order). It is not like that game\, it was never meant to be like that game. If you come in with the expectation of it being like GoW you will not enjoy it as much. And I think that is what is happening here. People are coming in hoping this game will be like GoW and then complain about not having enough action scenes (which there are a plenty). If anything I would compare this to Resident Evil 4\, in pacing. I'll give you an example. When the movie Godzilla (2014) came out I was expecting a battle royal. I expected the movie to be 95% Godzilla battles and 5% story. Thats not the case. You hardly see Godzilla. And when the movie ended I hated it in that instant. I thought \""That is not Godzilla\"". But then my brain started to digest the movie I have just seen. And started accepting that my expectation for the movie was unrealistic. After I realized that I went back and saw it again for what it was. Just simply THE BEST take on the character since the original Gojira came out.BUT if you HAVE TO compare it to GoW then Gears would be The expendables to the The Order's Saving Private Ryan. One is heavy in action the other one is heavy on story. And I would pick the story one every time. The Order is just like a book that you read cover to cover to then start again and experience it one more time. It is that good. But I wouldnt call it perfect.The black bar while not cumbersome during the most part of the game in instances would not let you is top your cover. In hindsight why should you be able to see over your cover? You are in cover right? But for a game like this I would have preferred a camera that was more separated from the character at least by a few feet. And I know there has been some complain around Chapter 7 where it is all cinematic before jumping to Chapter 8. But if they didn't showed you the \""title card\"" for the chapter change you wouldn't even care. And I think that exposition sets up the second half of the game perfectly.All in all should you buy it?-  If you like greatly written stories\, with visuals and audio to match\, then it is a definite YES.-  If you just want a dumbed down action game that just lets you shoot everything in sight without rime or reason\, then this game is not for you.… Expand"

It is almost insulting to call this a game\, it is more an interactive movie.The main reason for this\, the game continuously shoves cinematic cutscenes down your throat\, which you cannot skip or influence in any way. This might be acceptable at the start to explain any game mechanics\, in a tutorial\, maybe after a big boss fight. But in this case\, it is overflooded with them and it destroys the experience. You shoot some enemies\, solve a simplistic riddle - cutscene. Over and over and over. Just horrible.Let's come to the quality of the cutscenes\, the storytelling - uninteresting in every way. The characters are badly written\, in some cases caricatures of normal people. The decisions and script is hollywood at its worst\, cheesy\, boring\, cliche. Sometimes it even gets weird\, so weird and unbelievable in its story\, a reminescent of the best worst movie of all time \""The Room\"". You will laugh when it wasn't intended\, because it is so hilariously bad.As a movie\, this game also would have been a huge failure.The gameplay - The fighting scenes start ok\, but detoriorate very fast\, as you constantly need to hide behind stuff. Pure 'cover' mechanics also at its worst. There just isn't much to do. You press cover\, wait for enemies to appear\, press shoot to aim and shoot them\, get hit\, back to cover. Repeat ad infinitum.There is one thing only that did not make this a total desaster - the graphics. They look exceptional for an early ps4 game. But. They are also bland. Brown and gray colors dominate everything\, but not in a good way. Where other games like Bloodborne creates athmosphere from the used color palette\, the Order just misses to do so. It is 'art' in a scientific way\, it simply won't be immersive sadly.All in all\, this is\, by far\, the worst 'AAA+' game I ever played. I felt ripped off\, cheated\, to be lured in with graphics only to realize what a monumental failure this game is in any other aspect. I prefer  playing 25 year old Wolfenstein 3D to this\, because it actually is somewhat fun to play.One last thing to mention - the overly positive reviews are simply a mockery. I get thet people have different tastes\, different realities. Sometimes they feel the need to justify a purchase\, sometimes they have no broad frame of reference and so on. But still. As a sane person and gamer\, you simply cannot judge 8 hours of bad gameplay and cinematics (that's basically all the time you will be able to get out of this game) for 60$ starting price as good or even phenomenal. Not with this gameplay and this cinematics. That is outright lying. Those reviews are bought\, no doubt in my mind (sometimes very easy to spot when they write something dumb like 'don't listen to the negative critics' - yeah\, right...)… Expand"

You'll learn to savor the action scenes and even feel encouraged to experiment with the weaponry as much as possible.

Pienso que será sin duda uno de los títulos más controvertidos en cuando a disparidad de opiniones de esa generación y uno de los más recordados dentro de este hobby por dicha controversia como pocos juegos hanThe Order lleva con muchos años de desarrollo y ha llegado también con mucha polémica detrás\, se podría resumir como juego esperado y juego polémico donde los haya a partes iguales. Pienso que será sin duda uno de los títulos más controvertidos en cuando a disparidad de opiniones de esa generación y uno de los más recordados dentro de este hobby por dicha controversia como pocos juegos han suscitado desde hace muchos años.Comenzaremos por decir que The Order es un juego que tiene una propuesta clara para con el jugador y es adsorber en este en el viejo Londres de corte steampunk que los chicos de RA han querido crear\, mezclando elementos de fantasía como armas imaginarias futuristas con la fantasía de la mitología europea\, todo esta mezcla casa muy bien y consigue una atmosfera que atrapa al jugador desde el primer minuto.La base de la historia tiene sus cimientos en una cruzada que tiene lugar desde hace siglos\, en concreto desde los tiempos del mítico rey Arturo. Los caballeros de la mesa redonda van pasando desde antaño sus nombres a los nuevos caballeros caídos que caen en combate contra la lucha contra los híbridos\, hombres lobo. La Orden de los caballeros se encarga de mantener el equilibrio entre ambas razas desde hace siglos y combaten a estos.Con esta propuesta arranca el juego\, con una historia y trama que si bien toma prestadas muchas cosas que se han visto ya en cine o libros\, las hace suyas para imprimir de un carácter único al mundo que nos rodea en el juego y a sus personajes\, algunos como el protagonista o su mentor con un fuerte carisma. El juego tiene un arranque lento\, siendo los dos primeros capítulos casi un tutorial largo cargado de una larga cinemática en el segundo para presentar el mundo de los caballeros en esta época que describo atrás.This image has been resized. Click this bar to view the full image. The original image is sized 1920x1080.Es un juego con un componente cinematográfico aun mayor que otros títulos que ya conocemos como TLOU\, o Uncharted\, no solo porque posea muchas cinemáticas si no porque intercala estas con el gameplay de diferentes maneras. Para analizar el gameplay del juego lo tendríamos que diseccionar en cuatro partes. Por un lado tenemos fases donde el juego toma prestadas fases con ligeros toques de plataformas\, donde deberemos de escalar por edificios\, o saltar entre tejados.Después estaría el gameplay mezclado con cinemáticas\, que salta de estas dejando de nuevo el control con el jugador y viceversa a cada pocos segundos para lograr ese toque cinematográfico a base de sentir que nunca perdemos el control del todo. Después el juego bebe también en algunos niveles de fases de infiltración donde deberemos de hacer gala de nuestro sigilo para que no nos descubran e ir eliminando a los enemigos por detrás como ya hemos visto en otros juegos.Por último nos encontramos con el gameplay de donde bebe el juego totalmente y es el del género shooter. Basado en un sistema de coberturas como ya vimos en los Gears of War o el más reciente Uncharted\, el juego no inventa nada nuevo\, y tampoco lo ha pretendido nunca el estudio en este contexto\, pero lo que hace lo hace muy bien en este apartado mostrando un gameplay igual de absorbente que otros\, gracias a dos factores. El primero la gala visual y sonora del que hace gala\, del que hablare más abajo\, mostrándonos un espectáculo audio/visual sin precedentes hasta la fecha en un videojuego\, y segundo por una solidez enorme en dicho gameplay\, sin fisuras\, con una estupenda jugabilidad que hace gala de un control perfecto del personaje y la armas que manejaremos.Nunca iremos totalmente sobrados de munición y probablemente en muchos combates\, sobre todo en los más largos deberemos de ir recargando nuestra munición que dejan los enemigos caídos en el suelo\, o tomando sus propias armas. El juego hace gala de una variada gama de armas\, algunas realmente impactantes\, otras igual de impactantes pero además muy originales como la escopeta de termita\, donde rociaremos la zona de un gas para después prender dicha zona con una bengala y el espectáculo esta servido. El equilibrio\, peso y consistencia de las armas es un apartado en el que se ve que el estudio ha puesto también gran mimo y esfuerzo\, ya que notaremos cada cambio entre ellas de forma consistente así como la dosis de realismo y brutalidad a la que se han dotado algunas de ellas como el arma de rayo donde arrancaremos literalmente trozos del cuerpo de los enemigos.Por último destacar que el juego bebe también del Uncharted en los ataques cuerpo a cuerpo contra los enemigos\, comenzando una secuencia corta para derribarlos cuando pulsemos un botón\, siendo algunas bastante gores y salvajes. Nuestro protagonista\, Gallahad\, mas que un cuchillo lleva una espada corta con la que no duda en atravesar con ella desde la clavícula hasta al pecho a los enemigos en escenas realmente duras y bastante explicitas.This image has been resized. Click this bar to view the full image. The original image is sized 1280x525.En el gameplay del juego también interactuaremos a veces con el escenario para avanzar por zonas\, pulsar elevadores\, mover carruajes\, lo típico y que como digo aporta siempre el control del personaje intercalado con cortas cinemáticas para lograr siempre ese enfoque cinematográfico. Después el juego posee también numerosas cinemáticas para narrar la trama\, algunas como la mencionada del capítulo dos bastante largas. En este sentido desde el MGS4 no había jugado a otro juego igual.Esta a sido una de las fuertes criticas del juego\, siendo únicamente el medio que han querido usar sus creadores para narrar la historia de los caballeros de la Orden\, al igual que otros creadores las toman prestadas en mayor o menor medida como medio para narrar lo que desean contar. Gustará esta decisión más\, gustará menos a algunos\, ya que entra en puros gustos personales\, y el juego hace una propuesta clara sobre ello\, sin matices. Pero como digo no es un punto negativo\, es la herramienta que han decidido de usar sus creadores para narrarnos esta historia.Otra parte crítica del juego es la duración. Este que escribe se termino el juego en normal en su primera ronda en algo más de siete horas. ¿Corto? Si\, pero no menos que otros del mismo género que han salido antes\, y con una base de horas del mismo promedio que otros. No tiene online\, que alargue la vida del título\, pero tampoco lo tenían otros de la pasada generación.El equilibrio entre cinemáticas y shooter toma ritmo a justo en el capítulo tres y la propuesta que hace el juego mezclando todos los elementos del gameplay que he comentado atrás llegará a absorber a unos más y a otros menos\, dependiendo de que este buscando cada persona en un juego.A mi personalmente la propuesta de los chicos de RA me ha gustado mucho\, hubiera sido un punto negativo que con tanta cinemática esta fuera mediocre\, porque entonces llegaría aburrir\, pero si algo de lo que hace gala el juego es de un guión realmente trabajado para un videojuego y de unos giros en la historia y trama que sin inventar nada nuevo\, están francamente bien realizados e invitan al jugar a no parar de jugar para seguir disfrutando de los acontecimientos de la historia.Sobre el apartado gráfico del juego cualquiera que haya disfrutado de la experiencia podría escribir más de un folio de el recreándose en el abrumador espectáculo que han conseguido en este nivel. El juego es ni más ni menos que una enorme CGI de alto nivel en movimiento\, alcanzando unas cotas que espero que marquen los juegos en esta generación a partir de ahora\, porque el nivel es tan alto y el salto tan grande que ahora todo lo que veamos que este por debajo nos sabrá a poco a no ser que goce de un gran apartado artístico que lo compense.No hay ni una sola textura mala\, ni un efecto dejado de la mano o descuidado\, la atención por el nivel visual del juego se podría decir que raya casi lo enfermizo\, y eso se ve en detalles como en el cristal de las lámparas por la noche mojado por la lluvia\, en como la iluminación de la llama interactúa con el agua que cae a través del cristal. Comento este detalle porque es un simple punto de luz en una fase que podrían haber solventado con algo más simple y no con lo que comento\, para mostrar un ejemplo de hasta que punto se ha cuidado cada plano del juego a nivel gráfico. Jamás en mi vida he visto tanto mimo en este sentido por un juego en cada detalle por minúsculo que sea.This image has been resized. Click this bar to view the full image. The original image is sized 1920x800.La banda sonora posee la misma calidad que el apartado gráfico\, donde violines y chelos muy presentes en ella\, dan ese toque oscuro al juego en el mundo y época donde se desarrolla. La música creada para el juego posee una calidad increíble manteniendo siempre todo el nivel\, pero destacan varias piezas donde realmente el compositor se ve que ha estado en estado de gracia regalándonos para los oídos unos temas abrumadores\, tanto los lentos para algunas escenas emotivas con algunos coros muy acertados\, como los más impactantes para otras. Sobre los efectos de sonido también habría que hacer un punto y parte. Londres esta vivo en el juego\, y la contundencia de las explosiones y sonido de las armas salta de la pantalla con mucha fuerza\, en resumen\, un gran nivel y cuidado el que se le ha dedicado a este apartado también.Resumiendo\, es un juego de unas 7-8 horas\, que durara más o durara menos dependiendo de la habilidad del jugador y de lo que se pare en ciertas pantallas únicamente para contemplar algunos paisajes que quitan el aliento\, o para recoger objetos del juego\, o sea una duración normal de muchos de los juegos de la pasada generación\, sin más. Los amantes de los platinos sacaran los de este juego en el primer día\, no ofrece retos fuertes quitando el nivel difícil de dificultad para conseguir trofeos difíciles.The Order es un shooter con grandes dosis de cinemáticas\, intercaladas con tenues pinceladas de plataformas\, sigilo y con fases de puro y clásico shooter con coberturas\, la mezcla de todo ello resulta homogénea como comento atrás ya en el tercer capítulo\, ofreciendo al jugador una experiencia que solo se podría definir como única\, porque para definir al juego diría que The Order es....The Order\, y no se parece en nada a lo que ha salido hasta la fecha por esto mismo que comento. La propuesta de RA creara odios y alabanzas dependiendo que quien sostenga el mando\, pero de lo que no se le puede quitar merito dejando de lado la mezcla que han querido crear en su gameplay que comento detalladamente atrás\, es que es uno de los juegos mas bellos y trabajados que se han visto jamás a nivel audio/visual\, y solo por el espectáculo que ofrece en este sentido merece ser disfrutado por cualquier amante de los videojuegos\, aunque no sea muy amante de los shooters\, ni de las cinemáticas. Es un juego que se debe de analizar en conjunto una vez finalizado\, y agitar y mezclar todo lo que ofrece en nuestra cabeza\, para hacerte después una única y franca pregunta ¿has disfrutado?.......… Expand"

The order is the very definition of a flash-over-substance game and it's saddening to see how many people are falling for it\, rating it highly based on graphics alone and ignoring the glaring gameplay and story telling issues.In short\, The Order: 1886 is a very schizophrenic game that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.

The amount of detail in this game in every aspect is astonishing: technically and visually the engines seems to be more capable than state of the art engines like UE4.

The Order 1886 unfortunately doesn't even come close to those games.The Order begins in the present with Sir Galahad being in prison. It makes a transition to the past and the \""game\"" begins. From the start the gun play has problems. Often times you'll zero in on a head shot and miss even though you are aiming at the head\, pistols seem to have better chances to hit its target. The gun fights are your very basic unoriginal take cover wait for dumb bot to come out of cover and fire. Repeat several times and you're done. When it comes time to fight the Werewolves its a lame QTE. There are a few some what platforming sections but unfortunately they are very small.The game looks beautiful but it become apparent quickly that graphic is what this game is all about as whole chapters are nothing but you sitting and watching. Which brings me to the story\, oh the story.The story is about King Auther and the knights of the round table who through the magic of the holy grail have managed to live unnaturally long lives and heal themselves through the black water as they call it. You later find out that not all actually any of them but one is left over from that time period all the others have taken on the names of the knights. The Order fights wait for it Werewolves and Vampires. As has become the standard for some reason in recent movies\, books and other media the Vampires control the Werewolves and are trying to spread all over the world.The game is very short and has almost nothing to explore or discover leaving you to simple run the little maze they have set up as a stage to get to the end.The Order is another game in a trend these days of games promising thing but unable or unwilling to deliver on them.

I agree that the game is brief; I beat it in 8 hours on Hard difficulty\, which is a decent length for a single player game\, but the main problem that people seem to be having with it\, is that it's filled with cutscenes.

It should be played but if I had it to do it all over again (I pre-ordered) I would wait for it to go on sale.  Once my boys have played it I will most likely trade it in.  I am glad I played it though and look forward to a sequel - as there inevitably will be - but I will wait for it to go on sale given the state of this introduction.The Order: 1886 brought to light the growing controversy in the gaming community about what makes a game?  This all seemed to start with The Walking Dead Telltale series - a strong narrative driven game of sorts that is more a visual branching novel with multiple ending states (not multiple endings). Given that there is game play in The Order: 1886 it is a game.  It is a VERY linear game that is more about the story and the cinematic telling than it is about strong game play.  It is fair\, in my estimation\, to compare it to Bioshock Infinite\, which is both a masterful story and game that nears perfection as a narrative driven shooter. (And length does not matter to me - its quality that matters).In the end the story of The Order: 1886 is well told but the game mechanics are poorly implemented and it holds it back from being a great game.  For me it was a pre-order game because I loved the setting and the subject matter and the game delivered on that end.  Where it lacked was in the game aspects - poor hit detection\, unresponsive controls\, HUGE numbers of QTEs\, This is NOT a game that should be pre-ordered and you can definitely wait for it to go on sale.  I think narrative driven shooter fans should play it\, but should also expect frustration at the QTE implementation\, the poor hit detection and lag in control response.  A system seller the game is not.Visual Presentation: The engine holds up really well\, its smooth visually with remarkable textures and great animations.Sound: Very well done with great ambient sound\, great weapon sounds\, remarkably good voice acting and a perfect soundtrack.Game Play: LOTS of QTE's and unresponsive controls for a twitch based shooting experience.  The cover system is frustrating\, the stealth portions are VERY poorly implemented\, the collectibles are okay but weirdly absent in terms of even locations within chapters so replay is diminished; there is no replay value\, weapon choice is forced\, hit detection is very poor\, the AI is predictable and turns the shooting into \""Whack-a-mole\""\, picking up items and turning them with them adding nothing to the plot was tedious and pointless... It was not a good \""game\"" for its game play and feels rushed and poorly implemented.Story: Great atmosphere and well developed characters and dialogue sets forth a world that will be really fun to explore.  The entire game was a set up for several sequels and was a complete first chapter.  As a narrative and cinematic story it was very well done.Recommendation:  Will appeal to players who enjoy story above all else.  As a shooter its a poor game.  If you don't care for story and focus on game play for value I would steer clear of this game.  If story is your thing and you can tolerate poorly implemented game play\, I would suggest you buy it on sale.… Expand"

The Order: 1886 is an interactive cinematic experience that you cannot find anywhere else. Flashback to nineteenth-century London where you can live through the myths that surround that exotic timeframe. You play as Sir Galahad\, a Knight of the Round Table\, and have to battle rebels and lycans as you deal with deception and treachery. While the game lacks in depth\, it makes up for it story and visuals.This is a perfect game to sit down and play with a spouse. It’s like playing through a movie. You can enjoy this short campaign in single hour sessions every night on the couch\, or in a weekend. The campaign has been finished in a five hour speed run\, but in my experience it took about seven to nine hours. The story mode is not the only thing this game has going for it. The visuals are absolutely stunning. This game is by far the best looking game to ever hit a console. I would often catch myself gawking at the facial animations on the characters. You can literally see pores in their skin\, it’s shocking. Someone in my family walked by my television and said\, “what show is this?”There are problems with this game. There is no depth at all. The story mode is the only component that it has. There is no multiplayer\, no bonus modes\, nothing. It is really aggravating. For a console that does not really have the arsenal of exclusives that the Xbox One or Wii U has\, this is a textbook dropping of the ball. After beating the short campaign\, there is no replay value. Everyone I know has bought and returned the game already\, and that is a bad sign for a developer that has not put out any solid games in nine years. I can picture myself spending an extra dozen or so hours on a wave based lycan killing mode\, sort of like terrorist hunt from Rainbow Six: Vegas or exo-survival from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.This game seems to have done exactly what it was supposed to do. Ready at Dawn had to know that the game was not going to take too long to complete. If all they wanted to accomplish with this title was have a great looking game with a fantastic story\, then good job. It almost feels wrong to pay sixty dollars for a game that is packed with less content than some games I have played on my smart phone. In 2015\, this should not be allowed to pass as a full priced game\, regardless of the technical prowess that is possesses. It is bittersweet\, to be honest. I want to keep playing this title\, but there is absolutely no reason too.Overall\, this game was fun for the time that I have played it. I really enjoyed the world\, the characters\, the story\, and the voice acting. I don’t think this developer should be punished for creating a solid game\, I just really hope they learn from their mistakes. Great downloadable content implementations can add longevity to this title to the point where it could keep a lot of people from trading their copies in.

The game is set in an alternate history of London\, England and revolves around a group of knights who keep the city safe from half-breed monsters. You play as Sir Galahad\, who is a likable and fairly interesting lead character. The story is mostly engaging with a solid group of characters and a wonderful setting. With The Order 1886\, for every pro there is almost always a con\, unfortunately. The voice acting is exceptional\, but the pacing is horrendous. The weapons are awesome\, but the enemies are uninspired. This trend sticks out as you play through\, but it’s in the back of your mind. The important thing is the fact the game is simply enjoyable to play. I kept wanting more after a few 1-hour play sessions. I am not the type to play hours at a time\, so this is how I played the game. The characters\, weapons and setting are what kept me going. While the premise seems to offer lots of action\, this just isn’t the case. We get lots of cut scenes\, which are well-acted and great\, but they pop in and out too often. That is where the horrendous pacing I mentioned earlier comes in. These transitions should have been much more seamless.Order 3The gameplay in The Order 1886 is a mixed bag. While it’s nice to just gawk at the stunning graphics (which we will get to later)\, a game has to be fun\, engaging and entertaining to be great. While The Order is fun\, it isn’t something that you will be playing over and over again. The game is a mere 7 hours long for crying out loud. It’s a sprint\, not a marathon. The gameplay consists mostly of walking in small corridors\, button-mashing\, quicktime events\, shooting galleries and cutscenes. This is a very linear game that lets you look but not touch. The items you do touch are well-realized and interesting\, but you can’t really do anything with them. I do like the newspapers scattered around that offer some leisure reading as you progress. The gunplay is above average\, but nothing to write home about. It is not as satisfying as you might think shooting your enemies\, at least not with standard guns. The more unique weapons are where the fun comes in. They are one of the best parts of the game. The enemies are about as average as it gets\, with only the half-breeds being remotely interesting or imposing. Even so\, when you fight them\, it’s a quicktime battle. This leaves much to be desired on the combat side of things. The other enemies range from generic rebels to a couple insanely resilient shotgun wielders. Get ready for some frustrating deaths at the hands of those guys\, the most terrifying thing in the game. Yes\, more so than the half-breeds. I must also note that enemies have poor A.I. as they will mimic patterns over and over. This takes a lot of fun out of the gameplay.Order 2Okay\, let’s talk about the game’s primary strength\, the graphics. This is the best looking game to date\, on any console. The Order is brimming with visual splendor. From dark\, grimy alleyways and corridors to the wonderfully beautiful time pieces you come across. The setting only helps the game’s visual case. It is a unique take on London in an intriguing time period in history. From the old wood stoves and shops in the street to the tall\, gorgeous historic buildings\, it is a remarkable graphical feat. the characters and their costumes are all well-realized and incredibly lifelike. Facial animations are especially impressive. With an excellent voice cast\, everyone truly comes to life. The lighting and water effects are incredible\, along with things such as fire\, stone and wood. You have to see it to really appreciate it. The music and sound design are also major pluses for the game. It all culminates for a unique audiovisual experience.Order 1If you want a cinematic\, story-driven game with cool characters and an authentic\, unique setting\, you should definitely play The Order 1886. Even if you aren’t a fan of these types of games\, I think you should still play the game once. After all\, it will only take you a few hours. This was a very difficult game to review\, because I was going back and forth between the gameplay\, length and pros and cons. It is definitely one of those titles that will be hit or miss for gamers. It shoots itself in the foot\, since it doesn’t give the player much freedom when it comes to gameplay or exploration. If you give us this beautiful and amazing-looking city we are going to want to explore and discover it! Overall\, The Order 1886 is downright gorgeous\, has a really cool setting and a solid story and characters. But it also has generic enemies\, linear gameplay\, a confining environment\, divisive quicktime events and horrible pacing issues.… Expand"

Cutting out content and selling it to us in bits and pieces in the form of DLC is quite infururiating because the average consumer experiences only a portion of the game\, and it opens up the possibility of a critic judging the game based on a non-dlc experience. Here we got a bigger problem\, the devs created the first few part of the game decided to sell it to us before finishing the full game essentially. Its got the most unsatisfying ending I've seen in the past 3 years of triple A\, its got the most cookie cutter storyline in what would have been a interesting story seeing as the premise for it basically is League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade. Graphically its amazing\, its not fun\, it feels like various modern warfare triple A games where used as inspiration and copied into this game. Cover based shooting\, with health regeneration mechanic (although it does make sense here since its Holy Grail water)\, QTE for boss fights (from Lara Croft or some other dreary adventure game)\, the werewolves are basically hunters from Dead Space 2 and barely any werewolves\, the supernatural elements just seem to become background noise (werewolves aren't necessary to whats going on by the end\, holy grail just is the explanation behind those in power). We are left feeling like something seriously went wrong\, not just the usual wrong of a severe lack of innovation or having all the innovation stripped away to be the most inoffensive recognizable gameplay we've seen before\, but a more severe wrong of basically the story being cut and development on the game halted so that only a small portion of it was hastily polished and released as is. If there is a game that is a prime example of whats wrong with triple A\, I think this game stands tall as a prime example of cookie cutting\, with Evolve showing us whats wrong with the DLC practice at its most extreme\, and Call of Duty as the example of a lack of innovation & unnecessary/annoying DRM.It seems Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zero might have done what a reviewer feared (King-Spara in My Two Pennies on Metal Gear Solid Ground Zero Gameplay Length). Games being cut down into pieces in terms of gameplay length\, and sold with barely any decrease in price. Lets hope these 2 games don't actually start this trend\, it might just be the final nail in the coffin for the stagnant triple A\, and the rise of a growing indie scene on various sites like steam's greenlight\, Desura\, Kickstarter\, IndieGamingStand\, Itch.ico\, GameJolt\, Unseen64\, Game Bundles (via IndieRoyale\, HumbleBundle\, IndieGala and BundleStars) and Gamejams.… Expand"

I was quite surprised at how many different weapons there were and they all had their own perks (even though I barely had a chance to use any of them). The story was more of a tease and I didn't find the quick time events that annoying.My biggest gripe about this game is the length and the pacing. It just takes a ridiculous amount of time for anything to happen which is not good when the story only takes 8 or so hours to complete. The characters are interesting but most of the time you just get sick of waiting to actually play the game and not just watch cutscenes. The placing of quick time events are also questionable because they occur after a long cut scene which leads to some slow reaction times because you weren't really expecting it. The stealth portions of the game are a joke and are one of the least developed aspects of the game. The gun fights are boring with some of the most generic AI I've seen in a while. The Lycan fights are uninspired and dull.In addition\, even though the world is so beautiful\, it feels empty. At least in AC Unity you felt like you were living during that time. In this game\, you feel like the world of London is just a desolate place.I knew exactly what I was getting into before buying this game but I still felt disappointed. If the story and pacing was up to the level of a AAA title\, I wouldn't mind such a short game.

The length wasn’t an issue for me\, it’s actually a blessing in disguise; if it had plodded on for several more hours the game would’ve become intolerable. As it was\, I basically just switched my brain off as the level design and combat sections never require you to think. You’ve seen it all before\, and the action never once gets close to being stimulating or tense. There are no risks involved\, the only variable being how long it takes to plow through the unimaginative AI enemies.As an aside\, one thing that bothered me throughout my time with the game was how lazy your character and his compatriots are. They never bother to distinguish friend from foe\, and there is no non-lethal option. A frequent sticking point in the plot is that there are never any enemy combatants to interrogate\, but the player is never given any other option.As much as I enjoy good writing\, games are an interactive medium. Unlike movies or books\, the key factor in video games is that the player is driving the action. Making games that put story-first is fine and has been done well before\, but involving the player is critical. If gameplay is going to be limited to QTEs and isolated snippets of combat\, then there needs to be multiple branches to the story. The player needs to feel like they are in charge of their characters decisions if their actions are scripted and combat is unavoidable and rote. You can tell a fixed story in an open-world or you can have a multiple-choice plot in a closed-world\, but you can’t have both. Player input in this game amounts to nothing more than a gimmick\, an afterthought.Again\, all of this would be a moot point if the key feature (the story) that Ready at Dawn harped on was actually worth it\, but it’s not. It’s the exact same kind of drivel you’ll find in any other AAA game. A laughable narrative combined with boring gameplay make for an unremarkable (and nearly unpleasant) experience. It’s just saddening that the best graphics to-date on console are wasted on this bore of a game.PROS:- Best graphics on console\, bar none- Interesting art direction- Decent voice acting and excellent facial mo-cap- Textured and imaginative musical score- Relatively bug-freeCONS:- Awful writing- Uninspired combat and QTE implementation- Brainless AI- Insta-death stealth segments- Lifeless worldReplay value: Marginal (Only if you want to replay the exact same story in the exact same way; no bonus game modes or multiple story choices\, and the only collectibles are audio recordings that are negligible to the overall story.)… Expand"

Well. It clocks in at roughly 6-7 hours. Unless you're speedrunning it. But if you're speedrunning it you're missing out on a beautifully crafter a detailed world deep with lore and built with love.Graphics 10/10: The graphics in this game amazing. Best looking next gen game to date. It manages to make even The Last of Us Remastered still look last gen despite it's graphical update. Every little detail in the environment is covered and the facial expressions of the characters show every little emotion they're feeling.Sound 10/10: The music and sound effects are spot on. The voice acting is INCREDIBLE. Especially given that they used a bunch of a nobodies. You won't see big names like Nolan North or Troy Baker or Jennifer Hale in this game. Hopefully these people get more work.Gameplay 10/10: Holy crap it's a completely unbroken\, functional\, polished game. Something that doesn't seem to get mentioned in any of the negative reviews. I didn't encounter a single bug during my entire playthrough. Movement and gunplay felt smooth and real and not jerky and clunky like it can in some games. Also the melee is thoroughly satisfying.Story: This is where the game really shines. This game is not afraid to have a deep and compelling story full of interesting characters that you want to know more about and the world they live in. If you've played games like the Metal Gear Solid series than you'll be okay since some of the cutscenes can last upwards of 10 minutes. But it's not 10 minutes of meaningless exposition. It's a full 10 minutes filled with story that SHOULD be there. They literally could not have cut down on the cutscenes and had the story remain nearly as good as it was.In conclusion\, don't believe the negative reviews about the game. The lack of multiplayer lead to a higher focus on the single player experience and they nailed it. Easily one of my favourite games right next to Alan Wake and The Last of Us. Even if you don't want to buy it borrow it from a friend who did. You'll thank yourself for it. This is what video games should be. Vehicles to create worlds and tell stories. Not day one paid DLC riddled husks that are obvious attempts just to make money from the hapless consumer.… Expand"

It really feels like this game has been a victim of a media furor and bad circumstances. The game is by no means as bad as some outlets are reporting in fact it is indeed very much the opposite. I can understand why some people will find this game hard to swallow mainly because the game play mechanics are quite simple and the time between them can be quite spaced out. Is this a problem? Only if you are incapable of not itching to press the buttons on your controller at all times. The negativity toward this particular aspect of the game is puzzling to me especially when you consider games like 'Gone Home' received such critical acclaim despite being arguably a very dry experience depending on your preference. I am aware that the game falls into the so called 'triple A' camp and therefore is rather pricey at launch but its just a good game despite what has been said about it so its a worth while investment.To be honest I actually respect this game for allowing down time between action segments. It might feel like you're not doing much at the time but the whole time you're absorbing your environments and taking in the atmosphere. It really reminds me of old point and click adventures at times. Granted you're not usually out to solve puzzles but the dynamic feels the same. Perhaps I'm just not a 'real gamer' but I believe there's space in the gaming world for these sorts of titles. I'd very much like to see a sequel and the main aspects I'd like to see altered would perhaps be the addition of some more lore or indeed a little more opportunity to interact with the world around you and indeed have the world fleshed out the world in general.Give the game a chance for yourself and judge for yourself.… Expand

The cover system is smooth and easy to transition between covers which is such a problem in most games anymore.

Third the storytelling and voice acting is very good but not GREAT as I wish it was. This game deserves at least a 8 or a 7.5 for its innovative graphics and tight shooting mechanics. Oh and did I mention how incredibly awesome some of the weapons are in this game??? Also the melee and quick time events are pretty solid even though this is a chief complaint among many critics and user reviews. I for one don't understand the complaint since Heavy Rain\, one of the most highly rated and innovative Playstation 3 games got 9 or 8's all across the board\, which is funny cause the only action in the game was quick time events. Which by the way I LOVED Heavy Rain but that's exactly the point I'm making. Why is this game getting the hate that it so doesn't deserve for its short length and quick time events when Heavy Rain didn't even have any shooting mechanics or action??? Gears of War campaign was shorter then this game's but yet that game received 9's all across the board? Yes I understand that Gears of War had multiplayer but it was so generic and lacking that it didn't add any value to the game\, at least not for me. It consisted of people running around shotgunning other players and required zero strategy. Also there is not multi-player or split screen for the campaign\, I understand this complaint. I do not understand why they didn't implement mulitiplayer or split screen to the campaign but I don't believe it's a reason to give this game such a ridiculous low score especially when it finally provides the innovative graphics\, a solid narrative\, good voice acting and great shooting mechanics that  this next gen has been waiting for and sorely lacking. I've played Ryse\, Killzone PS4\, Infamous Second Son\, Sunset Overdrive\, Titanfall\, and pretty much every exclusive that has come out for both next gen systems. This was the most impressive. Yes PS4 and Xbox One has yet to have a GTA V (not counting the upgraded version)\,  Uncharted\, The Last of Us\, or a Metal Gear Solid caliber game yet but its still just over a year of being out. Finally I believe they have a very good next gen game. This is a story driven single player game\, if that isn't your taste and your into the whole 100 hours free roam gameplay and heavy into multiplayer\, then this isn't for you.

93549,Order1886,2015-02-28,7,"There has been a lot of debate surrounding The Order 1886; even before its release. One of the biggest debates was over the length of the game. My first and only play-through thus far was on hard and it took just over 9.5 hours to complete. I did quite a bit of exploring\, but apparently not enough since as I didn’t earn any of the collection trophies.The Order is a story-driven gameThere has been a lot of debate surrounding The Order 1886; even before its release. One of the biggest debates was over the length of the game. My first and only play-through thus far was on hard and it took just over 9.5 hours to complete. I did quite a bit of exploring\, but apparently not enough since as I didn’t earn any of the collection trophies.The Order is a story-driven game with very sparse gunplay. There is a lot of walking and a handful of stealth missions. Though gunplay is sparse\, there are several other gameplay elements such as lock picking and overloading electrical boxes.The story is quite engaging and drew me in from the beginning. I completed the game in 4 separate gameplay sessions\, but I didn’t want to stop playing any of them. Alas\, I either had to go to work\, to bed\, or eat. I played the bulk of the game on a Saturday and stopped only for lunch. Had time permitted\, I was intrigued enough that playing through in one sitting was very likely.The Order performed quite well on the PS4. I didn’t notice any frame stuttering or frame rate drops. It transitioned from cut scene to game play seamlessly. In fact\, a couple of times I stood there not knowing the cut scene had ended. The visuals were phenomenal. Clothing and materials looked as if I could touch them and they draped over the characters quite well rather than seeming like a stiff sheet of plastic. Little details like wind blowing through Galahad’s hair\, realistic looking flames\, grimy fingernails\, the way light interacted with everything\, casting shadows or rays through atmospheric dust\, were everywhere. Many times I stopped just to admire the details in this alternate version of LondonThe game was very linear. There was not a lot of room for deviation with the exception of the occasional out of the way path usually leading to a collectible. There were quite a few cut scenes. They felt like they were the majority of the game\, but that feeling maybe partly due to how seamless the game moved from cut scene to gameplay. There is also lot of QTEs in this game\, but I was so engaged in the story they didn’t bother me.The minimal UI\, including the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen\, lent itself well to the cinematic style and helped deepen the immersion. Honestly\, the only time I actually noticed the black bars were during the rare moments when I’d think about something I was going to write in my review (A.D.D FTW)\, and the bars would cross my mind. Otherwise I was so focused on the story\, they were invisible to me.The ambient sounds made the environment feel like a living\, breathing world. Other sounds\, such as gunfire or your gear moving while walking\, further drew you in. The music was subtle at times\, and very dramatic at others. It never seemed out of place and coupled with the outstanding visuals\, it felt like you were right in the story.The combat wasn’t innovative\, and didn’t bring anything new to the table but was still very fun. Putting one right between the enemy’s eyes was very gratifying and never got old. The gunfights weren’t challenging until the last few\, though I was playing on hard. I think I died more on those last few skirmishes\, than I did in the entire game prior to them. The stealth kill missions were a little weird at first\, but once I got the timing down of sneaking up on someone\, they became much easier. Cover was kind of clunky. Some times I couldn’t use an object as cover that seemed like obvious cover to me. I couldn’t move around corners while in cover which made the stealth missions and gun fights a little more difficult.In summary\, The Order is a very cinematic story-driven game. This is where it shines. If you’re looking for an action game\, pass this one up. It’s not action packed\, and has a lot of QTE’s and cut scenes. On average it is about an 8 – 10 hour game. However\, If you like cinematic\, story-driven games\, do not pass it up. The Order 1886 is by far the best cinematic game have I’ve played\, and comes in just behind Mass Effect and TLOU For Story… Expand"

The transitions from one to the other are practically seamless\, and the pacing of the action and the storytelling aid the viewer/player in both understanding what's going on and participating in what's going on.If you make this purchase\, expect to be entertained\, and to take part in a highly-scripted cinematic experience that is more tightly controlled than you may be used to in other games. It's still fun\, but because of the high amount of detail and attention to story\, the game is shorter\, and that is a good thing from my perspective. I like experiencing a game that I can finish quickly sometimes\, keeps up a solid story pace\, and one that doesn't drown the story in repressive amounts of repettitive action.In a way\, this is a very experiemental video game\, and it definitely crosses genres in more ways just crossing FPS and animated movie\, by both incorporating stealth components and button-press fighting like from God of War. The mere fact that it's a very short game is also different these days\, with many game companies trying to extend playtime by giving you infinite challenges in open worlds. These are okay\, for what they are\, but they lack the storytelling acumen present in something like The Order: 1886 or in The Last of Us\, which has a very similar feel.The Order was successful in holding my attention over the entire story\, and if you have a weekend day to sit down and play this\, you can sit down in the morning and be done with it by evening\, even taking dining breaks. I really enjoyed the story\, which is something I cannot say for most video games out there (cough-Destiny-cough).The acting in the game was also top-notch. It looks like they did some seriously amazing motion cap work with this\, and worked hard to make the facial expressions and voice timing perfectly working every time.Now for the reason I removed 1 star:I disliked the button-reaction boss battles. I've always hated these in other games as well. I did not see that in the trailers\, so I assumed that the battles would all be FPS-style. They aren't. The button-reaction challenges involve attacks by very fast opponents and learning to time your attacks to STOP early enough so that you can press the button you need to dodge. The dodge timings are highly scripted\, and you don't have any option on what to do. You either hit 'circle' at precisely the right time\, or you don't\, and you die pretty fast if you don't. The attacks aren't logically placed\, and the button timings seem wrong in my hands. For example\, right after a creature attacks\, you have to attack back\, but I ended up pressing the attack button repeatedly before my character would attack\, because I wasn't in the 'attacking window' or whatever. There was no smooth fighting feel for this\, it was all way too scripted for my taste. Additionally\, high-powered rifle shots to some combattants\, the Lycans\, did not seem to phase them. There was no indication that shooting them in the head even slowed them slightly. They weren't dead until you landed the last shot.Unfortunately\, this clouded a rather otherwise solid FPS experience. The weapons\, particularly the thermite rifle and the arc lance were inspired and fit into the technology of the late 1800's\, assuming some boost in weapon innovation from England essentially having complete imperial control over most of the planet\, and being forced to develop weapons to combat the main threat of the story.About the FPS fighting - there were times when I did not like the combat system because the weapon tracking was rather slow\, or the weapon would be on target\, and then suddenly the character would pull the weapon into ready-position\, not shooting position\, because you happened to slide a little close to a corner or a railing\, instead of staying on target\, even with the aiming trigger pulled. This became rather frustrating\, but you could deal with it.Finally\, there are ethical issues. Every FPS game needs to deal with the ethics of your character needing\, or wanting\, to kill large numbers of people. This isn't a stealth game\, for the most part. You cannot choose to evade your enemies in most situations\, or if you can\, I could figure out how to do it only once or twice. You're forced down a direct course 100% of the time\, following script\, and that often involves a large number of rebels or company men attacking you.This means that for some portions of the game\, when your character's been specifically instructed to keep violence low and try to not kill people\, you end up in massive firefights that you might conceivably have prevented had you done a better job staying undetected. It seems that the main character doesn't particularly care about that stuff because he's spent several lifetimes killing\, and without any sort of repercussions for doing so… Expand"

The story was great but had a lot of sequel set up. Hopefully there will be story dlc just to add more lore and hours of gameplay  to the game's fantastic setting. Also a lot of people complained about the game's length as being too short. I'm proud to say that the game isn't 5 hours long it's about 7 or 8 but it seems much longer when you play which is a good thing as if you're a fan of cinematic story based games Like I am you  won't want it to end quickly. I recommend playing on hard as it will provide a challenge and add to the game's playtime as enemies act realistically and are very aggressive. Overall the game is fun it's great however it isn't worth the full price and the reason being is once you beat it.. that's it. There isn't any extra missions\, modes\, or multiplayer since you beat it and see the great story to it's disappointing conclusion you're done. It is a shame because this is a top notch beautiful and awesome game that could of given so much more. I recommend playing it at least even if you have to red box it like I did.

A lot of time was spent on the player model your camera will be parked behind for the duration of the game\, so naturally that looks great. Past that most of the level architecture is mediocre\, but If you can get past the totally out of place permanent black bars you will enjoy the game.Gameplay: This is a third person shooter with the occasional sniper rifle putting you in first person mode. You would assume the gameplay would be centered around shooting mechanics\, but it's not. Bullet trajectory is completely nonexistent\, shots have no penetration whether you're shooting rebels or otherwise. The second you pull the trigger the round hits whatever your crosshairs are on\, leaving the player with an unshakable feeling I can only describe as \""laser-tag like\"". This is the sole reason I chose to score the game a 5\, it simply fails to deliver compelling core gameplay mechanics for a \""next-gen\"" console.The game sticks you in several close quarter combat situations where enemies are at a max range of maybe 30 yards\, but you are encouraged to use a sniper-rifle. Using a scoped weapon at this range is completely nonsensical\, and often times you find that enemies are so close they outrun the scrolling speed of your scope. You also face dozens if not hundreds of quick-time events throughout the game\, something I still consider a gimmick unless you're playing a rhythm game like Osu! for example.The \""inspect\"" feature that gamers who played L.A. Noire will be immediately familiar with serves no practical purpose\, so why is it in the game?So what did I enjoy with the game? Well\, the Thermite Rifle was awesome. That's all I have to say\, everything else was unremarkable in every way. The voice acting was inconsistent and accents annoying. The cut-scenes were beautifully done\, but this was supposed to be a game. The shooting was amateur league stuff\, and the AI was downright stupid at times. Absolutely zero replay value\, confident you would fall asleep the second time through.The atmosphere? Great. The story? Leaves so much to be desired.The actual product?

Even if you are not a seasoned gamer\, you will recognize that the game rehashes a lot of mechanics and formulas from other recent game titles and countless movies as well (in terms of plot and narration). Dishonored\, Last of Us\, or Bioshock Infinite come to mind. The problem is that the game does not quite succeed to implement the aspects of the past well and fails to deliver enough of fresh and new material of its own.Order 1886 is very linear\, with the world that is only glimpsed at that even at the end remains very unexplored. Transitions from gameplay to cinematics are smooth on screen but forced in terms of pacing - dull and inconsequential exploration sequences are followed by generic shooting galleries\, then some QTE mashing and a cutscene. Rinse and repeat several times and that's all you get. The plot isn't particularly original or interesting and has no notable twists. The game also isn't very long (cca 6 hours) and has an unsatisfying and ambiguous ending. As a whole\, the game really feels like a prequel to a real thing but isn't really priced as one.All in all\, this game has high cinematic aspirations and assets to back them up so I suggest\, instead of playing it\, watch it as \""let's play\"" movie and save yourself some disappointment and money.… Expand"

Maybe one mundane day of Galahad's life before plunging into the storm.I hoped that recordings you find through the game will contain such interesting information\, since the first one attempts to do that BUT they are random and contain anything from lullabies to random letters not connected to the story. I find that a wasted opportunity. There's also quite a lot of items that you can pick up and inspect but they don't contain any information valuable to the story (random letters\, boxes\, etc).Weapons are interesting and feel really good\, BUT this game is a gallery shooter. If you felt like killing waves after waves of enemies in Uncharted was bad\, this is worse. Once you get to the skirmish area\, you hide behind crates and face a little army. It gets ridiculous sometimes.The game didn't feel as short as people made it seem. I haven't counted\, but I'd say it took me about 7 hours.

93683,Order1886,2015-03-29,6,I can't give this game any higher than a 6 out of 10 because it has such a short length. This game is pretty fun but It's only like 5 hours long which is unacceptable because the games costs £55. It's a fun time but is not worth the money.6/10
93684,Order1886,2017-03-28,6,I will start off by saying unfortunately a lot of what you may have read is in fact accurate.While The Order: 1886 is a graphical masterpiece it has far more in common with titles released by TellTale Games than it does third person shooters like Gears of War. In it's brisk 5-7 hour run time (largely depending on player skill and the want/need to find the collectibles).
93685,Order1886,2015-04-04,6,"On the surface\, The Order 1886 is a remarkable feat.

Over the years we’ve seen games become more focused on cinematic experiences and telling captivating stories\, most games use a mix of gameplay and cutscenes to take theOn the surface\, The Order 1886 is a remarkable feat. Sadly\, once your eyes adjust to its console defining graphics\, that feeling of greatness slowly fades and this PS4 exclusive becomes an incredibly conflicted game.  Over the years we’ve seen games become more focused on cinematic experiences and telling captivating stories\, most games use a mix of gameplay and cutscenes to take the player on a journey.  The Order 1886 is the perfect example of taking this idea too far.There is no denying the physical beauty of The Order 1886.  The player finds his or herself in a magnificent looking London during the year of\, you guessed it\, 1886.  Every physical detail is present\, from the cloth movement to how a bottle rolls over the cobblestone streets.  This just proves how beautiful a game can look.  Sadly the attention to the world’s aesthetics may be the cause of the game’s greatest downfall.Just like The Order itself\, the story is far better on the surface.  The player takes the role of Sir Gallahad\, a member of The Order\, a modern facet of King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table. Their goal is to maintain peace within an alternate historical version of 1886 London.  The Order’s main enemies include a small band of Rebels and Werewolves\, or Lycans.  From here the story kicks off and slowly unravels till you reach an ending that will make shrug and say: “I guess it’s over?” When you're playing The Order\, shrugging will probably be something you do incredibly often.From the get go 1886’s main problem is revealed.  Pacing is certainly the enemy to any story and it is obvious from the start.  Most of the game’s chapters are filled with sections that the require you to walk\, incredibly slowly\, through a room\, hallway or dark corridor.  The game’s total playtime is no more than seven hours long\, but that really isn’t the issue.  The problem is how conflicted the game is at its core.  While trying to tell it’s less than satisfying story the player watches cutscenes\, slowly walks around\, and occasionally shoots enemies.The Order 1886 plays like the game equivalent to a pop-up book that only occasionally has little tabs you can actually use. As you meander through the game’s sixteen chapters\, some of which are only cutscenes\, there’s something that becomes progressively apparent. This isn’t an experience you become part of\, no this is a story that you’ll be force fed.  The story contains no sense of exploration\, danger or even depth.  This style of storytelling only subtracts from The Order’s positive notes\, like Sir Gallahad\, the outstanding lead character\, the remarkable over all world of 1886 and the interesting war between Knights and Werewolves.The Order’s combat is one of its greatest aspects; it plays like a traditional third person shooter\, yet doesn’t add anything new to the genre.  Each encounter is still enjoyable and a welcome break from the walking and waiting.  The vast array of weapons is another strong aspect of The Order 1886. Each gun is unique and fun\, but you really only get to use each weapon once or twice because of how little combat situations appear.Despite all of The Order’s substantial issues there is some definite promise for the future of this franchise.  1886 may not be the greatest third person shooter or even tell the most captivating story\, yet there was a certain appeal.  The game’s world is something truly special containing a surprisingly strong lead character and drop dead gorgeous visuals.  Despite some small of The Order’s strengths this still may be one you can pass on.… Expand"

I love the steampunk weaponry and the Victorian London setting and aesthetic.   There's plenty of good\, and some frustrations.  Nothing i'd say is strictly \""bad\"" - maybe the length\, it's far too short.While I prefer a first person perspective\, for the most part\, this game uses the third person very well.  I never feel like it's a hinderance to my view or anything.  The graphics are excellent - I'm not one to base much on visuals\, but this game is impressive.  The firefights are mostly excellent.  What I really love is that this isn't one of those annoying games where enemies take unrealistic damage.  Headshots take guys out immediately\, which is satisfying.  The various weapons are fun.Are you a fan of \""quick time events\""?  I'm on the fence: I don't think they're evil but I recognize that they also sacrifice control in the name of a more cinematic experience.  The QTEs can pop up with no notice and it's very easy to miss your marks.  But then it's also very quick to restart the game if you mess up.The Order is NOT an interactive tour de force:  stuff looks great\, but you can interact with precious little in the environment.  Search a room\, and find the few hotspots scattered around.  Again\, I'm not sure where I land on this.  On the one hand it's almost refreshing to have a game where you can't grab every minor object in sight.  Of course the game is very linear because of this - you're not really choosing your path\, you're following the only path available\, and there's a minimum of other stuff to get you sidetracked.Still - if you buy this game for a good price then I feel it's very much worth it.  I had fun\, and I find the combat fun enough that I'm replaying it.  There's a lot that could've been done better in this game - or\, let me rephrase that - perhaps more could've been done to open up the world for exploration?  I don't know.  Every game is a sandbox these days.  Having a game that just pushes you through the story isn't necessarily bad.As you can see\, even in my \""enthusiasm\"" for this game I'm kind of  wishy-washy.  I like The Order: 1886.  It is a fun\, solid premise for a franchise that never got off the ground.  Perhaps it's a bit old fashioned\, not being an open world sandbox.  Many games only give you the impression of freedom\, and maybe that's one of the problems - The Order tells you where to go and what to do next - there's not much else you can do other than move on to the next plot point.While enjoyable\, this game was a missed opportunity. It could've been so much more\, and it's a shame that this didn't get off the ground as a franchise.  I can totally see why gamers didn't flock to a 5-7 hour\, cutscene-heavy adventure.  But there is a certain charm here\, if you're willing to look past some of the shortcomings.… Expand"

The same can also be said for some of the games more unique weapons as you find yourself using the same weapons for 90% of the already short actual play time\, only allowing for around 10% of hands on times with the \""cool weapons\"". The game controls well enough as a third person shooter\, but I can not stress enough that for such a minute amount of gameplay time\, it should have been absolutely exceptional.The characters and atmosphere are the strongest aspects of the game outside of the graphics\, it made me frustrated that the narrative moved away from it's supernatural elements too quickly as I felt that was the element that really could have made The Order stand out from other third person shooters or cinematic adventure games. I only hope that Ready at Dawn moves the series in a slightly different direction if the series continues and given the events at the end\, I would say it's entirely possible we could eventually get a sequel.To actively address the cinematic ratio black bars\, they did not hurt my experience with the title\, nor did they provide any benefit. They meant absolutely nothing to me either way and did not effect the score of this review in anyway. The game is beautiful and well acted but none of that can change the fact it's just not very good.(Note: Any review under a 5 is an absolute joke and anything above a 7 is laughable and both cases should raise questions about the review/reviewers agenda.)… Expand"

The Order is a wonderful game and the gripes people have are baffling.I can only assume that they must have had something in mind going in and that they felt what? Disappointed? But enough of what others may have thought. Here’s my take.The Order is a great game. Not a good one\, not better than you have heard; a great game. Of course it is beautiful\, you’ve heard that. But not just because of it’s graphical fidelity. It looks great because it feels like a place. It feels like a sooty\, recently industrialized turn of the century London. In the grit and blowing papers man it has got the feel of a foreign place that you have somehow been before.And the characters too. They are there. They are people. They feel right. I cared by the end of the game how things were going to turn out.The game itself? Well for one thing it is not the interactive movie you’ve probably heard it was. It has no more cutscenes than Uncharted 4\, maybe less. And they are there to move the narrative exactly as in UC4. Excessive? Never. Overly lengthy? Nope. If you didn’t mind them in UC4 you won’t her either. If you did\, well then maybe play something else. This is a game with a story to tell. But not told to you. It is yours to live. Like many great games.But the game; how does the damn thing play?Flaws first\, other than bosses (though there are not really any such thing)\, the creature fights are bloody awful. No ifs ands or buts just terrible. Thankfully they are few and short. There are also a few forced stealth sequences that are a pain. Not game-breaking but not good at all. I personally hate any insta-fail mechanism in any game and here it effing grates.The rest of the fights are terrific. Good mechanics and good foes. And never does it feel artificial. It always felt perfectly contextual. Good cover mechanics; good feel like “oh damn I just got shot” and “hell yes I just nailed that guy”. And the weapons are so damn cool. Again they evoke the steam punk sensibility and they feel right and fun.And that’s the thing. The game is fun. This game has a great story and wonderful mature characters (I for one am glad to be playing a character who has a few years on him) and a real …feel. It is short\, but man did I enjoy the ride.As I said I don’t know if people were expecting a different game or what. But The Order delivers. If you have seen the trailer and you thought as I did “oh man that looks cool” as I did. You will not be disappointed.And hey. To whomever owns the damn IP: Make another one!… Expand"

Honest reporting has taken a backseat to sensationalized\, clickbait\, lowest common denominator trash. Payouts\, scandals\, controversy\, political bias\, all have turned the world into people living in a bubble or vaccum of their liking. The Order 1886 is a remarkable video game. Not just in the quality of its technical aesthetic (which is the most astonishing thing ever seen in a video game) but in its storytelling and diverse gameplay that does what's right for its story and not what's right to appeal to every gamer under the moon. Single player campaigns are the heart and soul of gaming. Always has been and always will be. Games that tell an immersive story and envelops the player in an incredible gaming experience is still a profitable sphere. And The Order will be successful. I bought it. I loved it (all 11 hours of my first play through) and so will millions of others. The gaming media won't change that. Multiplayer is an added bonus in video games. Every game doesn't have to be everything for everyone. And the outright hatred and bias this game has faced for not being Call of Duty or even Gears of War is despicable. Gears of War dreamed it had a story and universe this sophisticated and well written. Gears of Wars story and characters seem as if written by drunken frat boys who wanted to make an alien invasion game. A quintessential dude bro fiasco with over maschismoed steroid junkies as leads. The Order aspires to be more than that. An I appreciate its classy take on the genre. Sorry if you don't. But not everyone wants their gaming dumbed down.And furthermore\, I have never been a tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist. But GOOD LORD some of these reviews wreak of alterior motive and disingenuous bias. Take this Digital Trend review for example. There is no way in absolute hell you can in good conscience score this game a 1. The quality is just too good. It's an undeniable technical masterpiece regardless if you find its gaming shortcomings egregious or not. I didn't because I really enjoy cinematic experiences. And the gun combat is incredible when it's there. Granted their could be more in the game. It's not perfect by any stretch but a 1?! Yeah right. The fact that the guy at Digital Trends used to be editor at Xbox The Magazine is a glaring red flag. I do believe he and SOME (not all) oft hear reviewers had a clear motive when harshly damning this game. Some people fear this game can rival and surpass Gears of War. Well Iin terms of story\, lore\,  graphics\, and  characters it eclipse it by lightyears.  Gameplay and game modes wise it admittedly hasn't but it has potential to with a sequel. Anyone who loved Uncharted\, Heavy Rain\, or God of War will love it. No multiplayer in those games\, no new game plus\, incredible experiences. Which is exactly what the Order is.

Instead this game got shaken down by poor media reviews that soured the user reviews by expecting it to be bad (you know how expecting something to be bad makes it so if you let it). I give it a Solid 8.5 (beats the pants off COD or the Resistance series - ugh).I am in awe of how good this game looks. You have to play just to see that for yourself. The gunplay is very solid (gears good) with different weapons to try out. You can't see over cover. That is true\, but can you see over cover in real life when you are ducked behind it. Its one of those gaming tropes we have gotten used to\, but it makes no sense to be able to see over cover you are ducking behind and its unfair that you can see the AI and they can't see you (poor ai). The black bars at the top and bottom of my screen\, that I was fairly concerned about\, might as well not exist because I don't notice them.The cutscenes are not jaring at all\, which I find them to be most of the time (like they take you out of the action and they look so much better than the gameplay\, graphically). Like Uncharted before it\, Ready At Dawn makes the gameplay look as good as the cutscenes so you actually have to move the stick to see if you are in control yet. The one negative I have is for the QTEs\, which I have no love for. They are not frustrating most of the time\, but there is a melee fight that was very frustrating to me because I couldn't see the prompts since they were tiny and off to the side of the action (normally these flash up on top of the action so you can see them and watch the action at the same time). I failed it until I just watched the prompts on the side instead of being engaged in the action. I will say there aren't any multi-button timed QTEs. Just single button/stick presses/moves. I would have prefered Batman-like melee controls instead of QTEs of course\, so that is my main problem with the game. Shooting good. Melee combat - needs improvement.This next praise is looked upon as a negative by some; The game is highly scripted and linear just like a Gears\, Resistance or COD campaign. I like a narrative driven game\, heavy on amazingly well voiced dialogue and story with beautifully crafted cutscenes. I lose interest in open world games many times if they lack some reason to move forward (ala Dragon Age Inq.). Should a game get lower reviews because it delivers a great story at the expense of the typical open world that I have become so bored with this gen? I say no. The game moves you slowly sometimes to soak in the enviroments. The devs put so much effort into making this game photorealistic\, it deserves your time to soak it in. So if you are a speed runner that goes as fast as you can through every game you play this game isn't for you. If you like to look at everything in a game and let it come to life for you then give the game your money and your time. It totally deserves your hard earned money. I see replaying this game a few times so I don't feel cheated (I knew it would be on the short side\, but so was Halo 3 and I never felt cheated just playing the excellently scripted campaign.

93741,Order1886,2015-03-07,4,"The Order | 1886 is the best looking game ever. That's about the only real pro I can find for this game though\, sadly. With bland generic gameplay that's hardly present at times\, you're taken across this hallway ride of cutscene to cutscene to cutscene to walking segment to cutscene to QTE moment to cutscene to finally a part where you're truly in 'control'\, and The Order's interesting world ends up becoming flaccid in its presentation. The story has some rather interesting concepts like King Arthur's knights of the round table actually discovering and keeping the Holy Grail and its magical water\, along with Lycans roaming amongst citizens\, Jack the Ripper killings\, and advanced weaponry from Nikola Tesla. However\, the story and writing is forced down with cliches in both its characters\, progression\, and its 'twists'.The main character is a piece of cardboard with a thick moustache and an army helmet whose only purpose is to be a gullible\, gruff military man that drinks pure absinthe. His companions consist of a French baguette that can't stop following people of the female variety. A woman that's a grey\, boring slab that can't handle being butt-hurt and is also a love interest. Because she is a main character at the protagonist side. And a woman. With lady bits. Making her the clear choice that you should want Gritty Moustachio to want that. Characters also include an old man mentor with just two days left until retirement with a fat red target painted on his face. And a generic nationalist basket of fish and chips soaked in tea that remains in the background of the story with half of his dialogue being\, \""I am the grey slab's brother. She is my sister. Oh brother\, what is a brotherly brother to do. I am her brother after all. DID I MENTION THAT WE'RE SIBLINGS.\""And not only that\, but the main villain is Indian. That's about as much as I can say about her. She also has a sister. That's about as much as I can say about her too. Oh wait\, she is also Indian. Their personalities are being Indian and telling Gruff McMoustache that they're the good guys.And The Order's story just has so many cliches\, I find it hard to believe someone was paid actual existent money to write it.- The 'evil' rebellion turns out to be the good guys.- The old mentor dies before the pupil's eyes. (Pun intentional.)- Pupil goes out on a personal revenge spat.- In a story with Lycans\, there's a twist that reveals vampires are in the story as well.- Vampires Vs. Werewolves- The rich\, big corrupt corporation actually turns out to be corrupt.- Allies turns out to be corrupt.- Main character with good intentions is seen as the bad guy.- Character who suffers a fatal blow who we've already seen in a flash-forward in the beginning of the game as alive\, turns out to stay alive. (Not so much a cliche\, but rather a stupid attempt to make us feel something.)- Old evil-looking man who was in -order- of everything turns out to be behind everything.- Game ends with a gunshot-cut-to-black.- Everything is set-up for a sequel.Most complain about the length of cutscenes or the gameplay\, but saying that the story is great\, when it really isn't. The plot of The Order | 1886 is that a vampire as Jack the Ripper is using wolf-men to make more vampires.  It's dumb. It's dumb. It's so dumb.But don't worry\, gameplay's just as bland as the greyness of this game. Generic third person cover shooting with the only interesting guns limited to certain segments of the game\, either with little unreplenishable ammo\, or infinite ammo to use for just a few minutes during one segment of a fight. QTE dick punching. The illusion of choice of whether or not you can stab a monster in the face or dick. Sucky monster fight that's recycled to be the final boss fight. Hardly any Lycans that you kill\, but wave after wave of expendable human men for you to mow down\, ridding London of half its human population. No vampires to fight. Boss fight is isn't even the main villain. Main villain is only in like two cutscenes\, both of which are never at the end of the game. Oh God\, I've gotten off track. What was I saying? Oh forget it. It's late at night. I feel depressed but angry talking about this mediocre game. I'm going to bed.tl;dr - The game is pretty but built like toothpicks with Elmer's glue. Combat is nothing special. Characters are boring. Story twists are cliche. Monster fights are sad rodeos and so few (maybe that's a good thing). And I beat it in just six hours and never want to replay it since it's just a set-up for a sequel. Don't spend more than twenty bucks on this game unless you want to get ripped off. Or just watch the 'movie' on YouTube for free. Have someone's sixty burnt dollars mean something if others can watch the shlock.… Expand"

There's an option to slow down time during gunfights\, which I still don't understand what the point of it is. I guess the developers thought it was badass or something and tried to throw in some matrix crap in there. The battles with the half-breeds are\, surprisingly\, WORSE THAN SHOOTING HUMANS. Of course\, I am talking about the regular encounters\, in which you try to shoot at them and then they go hide and 5 seconds later\, they show up out of nowhere and ram your ass! Most of the time they don't even try to kill you\, they just knock you down and then it's back to trying to shoot the ******* without getting rammed! It's an annoying process\, and also\, I find it strange that for a game that revolves around the 'Battle between man and the half-breeds' most of your enemies in the game are humans. Huh. Moving on\, we have everyone's favorite: QTE's! No\, but seriously\, these things are the worst. The game is filled with them and they are generic and boring and do nothing to improve the gameplay. And ending on a good note\, the game does have some superb voice acting. Kudos to the voice actors.

A video game I believe is suppose to have more game play than cutscenes\, there are a lot of QTEs too but we should of expected that as almost all footage of the game before release had them in it but I believe if you are going to use QTE in games\, you should offer even gameplay.. Shenmue back in 1998 did it correctly\, that game you could do basically everthing.I know some are upset about the bad review scores but  you got to understand that a lot of us gamers do not like playing a video game that has more cut scenes than game play\, I even gave Metal Gear Solid 4 flak for that\, but the difference between that game and this one was that in MGS4 it still had fun gameplay.The Order can be fun but I wouldn't call it anything special.Visually it is outstanding\, I do not like black bars on the screen\, but whatever. The game runs smooth and I was happy to see that this may be the first game this generation (on PS4 anyway) that does not have bugs\, but I don't know if that should be a + or not because no game should have the bugs that we have been seeing lately.  here is a breakdown of my review..Gameplay- 3/10Replayability- 3/10Story - 6/10Graphics - 10/10Sound - 8/10… Expand"

The AI even on hard mode is black and white.  They shoot\, they duck while reloading\, they occasionally blind fire to change it up\, and if your far away they slowly duck and cover towards you.

It just ended up feeling 'restricted' and gives the game an 'on-rails' shooter feel for most of the game.The storytelling is indeed cinematic.

The steampunk versions of your everyday shooter gives a punch and that makes firefights and battles all that interesting. Plus\, there ARE exploding limbs and heads so that Arc Gun makes it worth while.I think the reasons why I gave this a 5 is pretty obvious now.It's TOO DAMN SHORT.

But rather\, there were a couple of scenes/moments/scenarios that could have used some judicious editing.  For those whining about it not lasting 50+ hours...  It's a story driven game.  Not a third person shooter that will throw you into situation after situation just for the purpose of you to live out some psychopathic\, sociopathic fantasy of gunning down hundred of guards/creatures/robots.2.) \""Half-Breed\"" Mechanics - This took FOREVER for me to figure out what was occurring.  And...as a forty-five year old?  It was a bit \""quick\"" for me...  Those with younger reaction times will probably not even notice.But the good:1.) IP - This?  If managed correctly?  Could be a bigger IP than Assassin's Creed.  So many different directions to go.  So many story lines and questions unresolved.  So much historical background for usage...  The mind boggles at the possibilities.2.) Graphics - I haven't seen better.  Anywhere.  In and of itself\, the Order: 1886 is a representation of what this machine can and will actually do.  Add as many superlatives as you want.  Amazing.  Astounding.  Jaw Dropping.  Unbelievable.  Insane.  Etc...etc...etc...3.) Story - Just a mere notch below the Last of Us.  Not quite the sheer level of feels\, but there are a couple of moments where you pray for it to end\, just so the tension and feeling of getting punched in the gut will stop.  Characters you actually give a rat's butt about.  A alternative \""steampunk\"" universe that works.I can see where the CoD\, or Final Fantasy players are going to be foaming at the mouth for the fact that there's no multiplayer\, there's not fifty or sixty hours of game play to wade through\, and there's actual characters instead of some cardboard cutouts representing the stereotypical \""hero\"" you're controlling.[TL;DR version]  This game leans more towards an adventure game...with some third person shooting mixed in to keep it lively...  Gorgeous graphics.  But at times\, the taut story line does drag a bit.… Expand"

93768,Order1886,2015-02-21,7,"Well I finished The Order: 1886\, the Playstation 4's first major release for 2015 and Ready at Dawns labor of love.

So how was it?Graphics: Well lets just get this out of the way first since its the most obvious aspect. The game is absolutely gorgeous the in game cinematics are all as promised running in engine and the gameplay segments look every bit as gorgeous which is to say VERY gorgeous. The game looks and runs great there is literally no slowdown at any point\, the textures are just mind blowing\, and the animation is fantastic. Yeah the game is only running at 30fps which may be an issue for some and I will admit I prefer 60fps BUT it isn't required for most games and for this kind of game its barely even an issue. I could go on and on why this game looks great but I don't think I need to.Story/Characters: I will say while I didn't care for ALL of the characters in this game I really did like most of them and was genuinely interested in their interactions\, personalities\, and relationships. The lead characters Galahad isn't super interesting on his own but he's pretty relate-able and I did want to join him on his journeys. I also really did enjoy the story\, as someone who loves the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table this definitely had me fully engrossed at a lot of the back story elements\, how these legends were connecting with this sort of Steam Punk London and the centuries old conflict that came out of it. Now I will say that the pacing does seem a bit rushed and the ending which I don't wanna spoil for you I will say ends on what I assume is a sequel cliffhanger which normally annoys me but didn't bother me to much here.Gameplay: For the most part the Gameplay elements are really solid. There are a only really 2 prominent puzzle mechanics in this game one which uses a sort of electric fuse thing and another which is used for picking locks neither is very interesting but they function okay. The gun play during action segments while not being anything to great works just fine and thanks to some really cool weapons can be pretty exciting at times. The only real issues I have is that the stealth parts of the game while mostly okay can lead to some frustrating deaths because of the cover mechanic which works fine during the shoot out segments but not so well here as there is no good way to transition from cover to cover and the other being that this game is extremely linear with little to no reward for exploring the environments aside from the occasional locked door with ammo and guns behind it and very few collectibles\, I do really wish they had given me more incentive to walk around this beautifully crafted world. These gripes while fairly minor do hurt the experience a bit. The game also isn't very long I finished it after about 6.5 hours and with no real replay ability I don't see myself playing it again for any reason outside a few trophies so if you want a game you'll be playing for weeks this isn't for you.Verdict: All in all I wouldn't say The Order:1886 is that magic system selling exclusive that Sony and Ready at Dawn wanted it to be. However while not a fantastic game it is still pretty good. I enjoyed the story however short it was\, the visuals were amazing\, and the game play of which there was honestly more than I was expecting especially in the middle of the game was pretty fun. I don't think its on par with story driven experiences like the Last of Us (which has better game play and story) or TellTales amazing point and clicks (which had great stories and minimal game play that didn't really get in the way) I'd say this game belongs in the same category as Ryse: Son of Rome\, games that may not be the top of their genre but are still enjoyable experiences.… Expand"

93780,Order1886,2015-02-21,9,"The order 1886 is a child of the Sony Santa Monica design philosophy. Beautiful to look at\, Quality Assurance that matches the definition of Quality Assurance\, and just fun. So damn fun.There is no denying the fact that from presentation\, to really specific game and story mechanics\, that the Order oozes influence from its bound to more successful meat head of an older brother\, Gears of War. From the cover based shooting and movement\, to the forced slow walk during radio chatter and set-piece moments\, when they want you to look at something.Every single thing about this game is a iterating on the Gears style. Normally that would be a bad thing\, but the most recent Cog in that series left a dry\, bitter\, and ultimately un-fulfilling taste in my mouth. Something that would also normally turn me off to a genre completely. Then I played Vanquish again\, and was pleasantly reminded that as long as the developers care hard enough\, anything can be good.So\, after much deliberation\, I picked up my pre-order of... the order\, (haha.... ugh...) and popped it in to my ps4 with the expectation of being underwhelmed\, but hopefully entertained. I can happily report that from moment one of the game my attention was held\, and all the way through my decidedly short play-through\, 9 hours in all\, I enjoyed myself.t certainly didn't hurt that the game is a sight to behold. The order delivers visuals on the level of good CG of yesteryear at real time speeds. It took a while for it to sink in that every facet of the game was being rendered as I was playing it. On more then 10 occasions\, at least\, I forgot that I was playing a game. Even when I was happily blowing away dozens of borderline racist depictions of the British\, I couldn't help but notice that every screen-shot that could have been taken from my time playing\, could have been easily pulled directly out of the game\, and slapped on the back of the box. The moment to moment composition of the shots in this game is impeccable\, absolutely so.In a word\, the game is: Beautiful.Usually\, I would reserve words like shot composition for talking about a movie. The fact that every element on the screen is always worth looking at\, is a testament to this game's unmatched visual aesthetic. I cannot get over how damn pretty everything looks. It certainly adds to the presentation that I never experienced a single graphical glitch or other debilitating game play bug the entire time I played. There was a single time during the entire experience that Nikola's pathing corrected itself. The problem lasted half a second.Bravo Ready at Dawn. I can honestly say that no other game has delivered such polish to my eye. That pretty much puts you in a category of your own. Well done.In terms of game play\, there isn't much to be said really. The game's bread and butter is hiding behind wall and taking inaccurate pot shots at other guys hiding behind similar walls taking pot shots at you. It is simple and satisfying to kill. bonus points for the fact the rag doll physics aren't embarrassingly comical looking. very rigid and grounded\, always a plus. The parts of the game where you don't shoot-bang your way to victory are spent meandering about a very charming\, albeit grey\, rendition of other world London\, either climbing on rickety looking and usually moist buildings or engaging in downright brutal and visceral\, close-range combat. Combat that ranges from above average pressing of the button and maneuvering of the sticks\, to fully realized smaller games that pit you up against the most realized and terrifying werewolves that I have ever seen.Dark\, disturbing; this game has it. It nails the feeling of its chosen setting\, and never fails to elevate the blood pressure. forget the price and treat yourself to an order of the finest meal cinematic gaming has to offer.The Order: 1886\, showing that just how good adventure games can be\, and just how big of a failure that David Cage has always been.… Expand"

I'm very critical about switch between cut scenes to gameplay. Are you actually pulling over the cut scene quality into the gameplay? Too often games tease us with their cut scenes of amazing quality to a point that if a game is announced with just a cut scene to show I throw it under the rug. I had honestly thrown the order under that rug. I pre ordered it only for the very cool collectors edition figurine. Then the time came for me to actually put my hands on the game and my opinion changed.The game isn't to long\, I beat it in roughly 8 hours\, but I was intrigued the whole time. Its not a perfect masterpiece but I enjoyed it\, it left me wanting more. To me this is the foundation for great things to come. The biggest issue with everyones negative reviews is they expect everything else other games offer in this game as well. At a young age I was never really interested in an open world\, coop\, multiplayer\, or decisions to make\, I loved films\, stories\, and adventure. The order appealed to me completely in this way. The shooting is solid\, the story is solid\, the graphics are amazing\, and its just an experience to behold.I don't see these \""negative\"" points and the reason why is cause the game is actually real and believable. Do you think in real life\, it would be a blazing inferno the whole way through\, michael bay's fantasy dream? No\, people die\, numbers dwindle\, people regroup and plan. While I am making my way through a warehouse to look at key items\, who knows\, the enemy might be planning their new attack\, or there might only be 2 left. Would I really have time to check every single box\, drawer\, and read every manuscript\, they might be ready to charge in. We have communicators\, they might only have word of mouth. We are skilled but we are just as vulnerable as our enemies. They\, on the otherhand\, are not as skilled. They are not knights after all. It's like navy seals to police\, they obviously are better trained. To many games have made the character be you\, but in this game you are not you. You need to think you are controlling Sir Galahad and this is his story.Now brings the question\, what would make this game a 10 for me? More control of the cut scenes\, big moments\, weapons (especially science ones)\, and more history on the creatures and the world\, just a bit more depth you could say. With what we have though the game gives you enough to look for in clues and questions\, but not so much to leave you overwhelmed wondering what did I miss. It does this as well as leading you in the right way to continue what its supposed to be doing\, telling a story.A 5 out of 10 is a bad game\, The Order 1886 is not bad game\, It's a solid game in every aspect.… Expand"

I savor cutscenes and have no problems with QTEs and the black bars so I don't see them as negatives. The one criticism that I completely agree with is that the story ended too quickly when things were just starting to get really compelling. I was left wanting more :(Gameplay is a guided experience that fits the game's cinematic ambitions. It's a hybrid of third-person shooting\, quick time events\, stealth\, and a couple of mini-games. The game manages to balance all these different mechanics nicely in my opinion. I mentioned \""guided experience\"" because the game does limit your weapon options during certain segments. Also\, you know when a firefight is coming from Galahad's automatic stance.I personally love story-driven single-player games and The Order: 1886 is comparable to my favorites such as The Last of Us\, Uncharted\, Dragon Age\, Mass Effect\, Heavy Rain\, and Beyond: Two Souls.All in all\, Ready at Dawn did a commendable job developing their first major title. The game is not perfect but I hope RaD can build upon the foundation laid with The Order: 1886 to give us an even better experience in the potential sequel. I give it an 8 out of 10 (but rating it higher because I feel critics have been too harsh with their scoring and are depriving potential fans of a great cinematic gaming experience).… Expand"

I probably doubled my game time by just looking around\, examining the many collectable items throughout the world. Old photographs\, newspapers\, and other random documentsPresented in a letterbox style with\, and I cannot stress this enough\, the most amazing visual fidelity I have ever seen in a game\, it is incredibly easy to immediately get drawn into The Order's incredibly detailed world. I probably doubled my game time by just looking around\, examining the many collectable items throughout the world. Old photographs\, newspapers\, and other random documents help to flesh out the world of this alternate London. But it is in its storytelling that The Order: 1886 really succeeds in the concept of cinematic presentation. The game doesn't trouble itself with an introduction\, there is no rundown of history at the start of the game that feels tacked on out of obligation. The developers trust their players to be able to handle a story and engage in the plot to find out what is going on. Details\, motives\, plot points\, history\, reputations\, all the necessities exist in this game through dialogue\, discovery\, and common sense. Missing are the strange\, awkward\, conversations where a player character asks offensively detailed questions of those around them for the sake of a player who isn't present in the world. Like a movie\, details unfold in real time. Questions are answered naturally as they would be in other mediums.What helps here is how well written the characters are. Ready At Dawn took great care to create characters that avoid the typical video game troupe. Player character Galahad is not your standard overly handsome charming rogue. His female company member Lady Igraine  is not helpless\, or over sexualized. Yet every character is oozing with unique personality. The character design\, motion capture\, and voice acting are beyond almost anything I've come across in a game before. I believed in these characters\, and cared for them more than many characters I have spent triple the time with in countless RPGs. The acting especially\, set a new standard for the industry. While most big games will have one stand out big name star\, everyone in The Order gave a stand out performance. Above all\, the characters are what I will remember about this game years into the future.As I said before\, The Order: 1886 is a third person cover-based shooter. Combat feels solid\, and the games variety of weapons all feel different. I was constantly searching the battlefield for new arms to try out\, from standard revolvers\, to the more exotic variety like the Thermite Riffle\, or the electricity launching Arc Riffle. Most fire fights are against the Rebellion that is rising up in London threatening the empirical power of the crown\, who pose the typical variety of threats present in shooters. Smartly the games half-breed enemies are left for shadowy combat and boss fights\, making it feel special and dangerous when you come across one. Intense and coordinated combat is much more satisfying than turning these enemies into nameless cannon fodder.The game is directly linear but the exquisite development of the world encourages exploration\, as do the dozen of collectable items hidden around. Game play feels incredibly fluid\, and smooth. And the game transitions so perfectly from cinematic cut scene to game play and back\, that you never feel safe taking your hand off the controller. Again the game looks so amazing that there is no visual difference between scripted scene and live action. And with the complete absence of any loading screen for the entire game\, you constantly feel like you're in on the action\, even when watching a minutes long cinematic. Brilliant development like this adds to the player immersion. The game does feature a number of quick time events which normally is a big disappointment for me. However\, Ready At Dawn takes advantage of the low level of impact that a QTE can have on presentation\, integrating button prompts into the game allowing for you to control the action on screen\, while fully enjoying a carefully crafted scene. In some instances the QTE allows for a contextual reaction\, giving you options as to which way to react resulting in different variations of the outcome. A smart and refreshing change of pace for a dull game mechanic.The Order: 1886 had me nervous. It was a huge new AAA IP from a somewhat successful studio\, touching on a lot of elements I love. While the possibility of error was large\, the game absolutely delivers.  Ready At Dawn has crafted an incredible new world with their alternate history take on London in the late 19th century\, and populated it with a complex and believable cast of characters. The story was well told\, and wrapped itself up nicely in a satisfying\, yet open for more\, ending. Nothing about the game felt rushed or unfinished\, and I felt well satisfied at the end. If this game is to be a sign of things to come for the industry\, I hope that it is quickly embraced. This is the game that shows what the PS4 can do. This is what next generation is all about.

I can't say its been the most enjoyable game of my life or even the best game I've played on the Playstation 4 but I can say I believe its a masterpiece in its own way and succeeded in doing exactly what the developers wanted.Well lets get the obvious fact out of the way. This game is the best looking game ever put on a console. A lot of games really beef up the graphics for the cutscenes and then scale back for the gameplay\, you wont find that here. This game looks the exact same both in cutscenes and gameplay. That alone really just makes this game a very unique treat. So many critics even before the game came out were bashing its use of familiar cover based shooter mechanics. Im not sure why however\, in my opinion just because Gears of War made cover based shooters more popular doesnt mean other games cant use it. The formula works and was entertaining in those games and yet almost the same combat style here is being criticized. The Last Of Us also employs that same cover based shooting system and that game won Game Of The Year. This game uses it and is labeled as boring gameplay. I had a blast with Gears of War and The Last of Us and I had a blast with the action in this game as well.I found the characters to all be quite interesting and the story was well rounded and kept me interested as well. Galahad is a very fun character and I enjoyed getting to see this man fight his way through the twists and turns the story takes. He might not have the personality of Commander Shepard but he is easily one of my favorite characters in a video game. The game truly does feel like a movie from beginning to end. There's intriguing dialogue\, likable and not so likable characters and to top it off the game has FANTASTIC score. I will say I expected a little bit more use of the Lycans which is one of the things that first intrigued me when the trailer first came out but Im not gonna get pouty about it.Another big complaint people have for some reason is the use of QTE's . This is a very common complaint in a lot of games and I dont understand whats so bad so I wont go into it too much suffice to say this game has them. To me they offer a fun alternative to the usual pointing and shooting but for some reason the use of them in games is like a guaranteed way to get people's feeling hurt. Pay attention and you might have to retry some scenes a few time but its all part of the challenge. The game is short but feels complete regardless and didnt feel short to me. i finished in about 8 hours on normal when it ended I was wanting more.

There were more cut-scenes than I expected\, but they never felt intrusive. The story and characters were very compelling and cut scenes never interrupted me in the middle of the action.The shooting and cover gameplay handles masterfully\, but I think there could have been more of it per fight. (It may be hard to justify waves of hundreds of enemies in a realistic game\, so I can see why they might have restricted a fight to 40 people.) However\, I have to deduct a point of the implementation of stealth. There was no mechanics to help you navigate or stay hidden like in The Last of Us. It felt like believable stealth\, but wasn't as engaging to play. This game is pretty linear\, but it never once felt claustrophobic.Graphics usually aren't one of my biggest concerns\, but this wouldn't be a complete review if I didn't mention the stellar attention to detail.

Well\, if you have even a shred of free will then you will know that a hell of a lot of \""professional\"" review sites should rarely be trusted.The Order: 1886 is by no means a perfect game\, at its core It's a pretty standard cover based third person shooter with the added bonus of some very unique weapons courtesy of the internets favourite genius\, Mr. Nikola Tesla. It relies too heavily on quick time events instead of letting players really get into some of the up close action and yes\, it is a little on the short side. I clocked in at around seven hours for my first play through on the hardest difficulty setting.That being said\, the positive aspects of this game far outweigh those few faults. This is THE best looking console game I have ever seen\, everything from the characters to the smallest leaf blowing in the wind has been created with the passion and love of a master artist. The main story and surrounding lore is gripping\, tense and beautifully told by the games many and granted\, often lengthy cut-scenes. Lastly how can I write this without mentioning the setting. A steam punk themes alternative history of Victorian London.... Simply superb.In short I would highly recommend people give this game a try and form their own opinion.

The overall atmosphere is excellent as well\, the combination of visuals\, voice acting\, sound effects\, and just the overall environment make you feel like you're in London in 1886.  The selection of weapons is great\, the quicktime events adds to the game in a positive way\, and the cut scenes aren't near as long as people make them out to be. I suspect that those of you who are **** and complaining about the quicktime events and the cut scenes have the attention span of a 5 year old and probably are use to playing mindless shooters like COD and Battlefront?!Speaking of shooters\, that is a big part of this game and one of the few gripes I have.  The shooting mechanics aren't the greatest\, but they work for the most part\, although the aim assist feature is a little useless\, as I would think you would be to lock onto your enemy. Other gripes I have about the game are the waves of generic enemies you have to shoot through\, the lack of half-breeds/werewolves you get to fight\, the lack of interactivity you have with your surroundings (kind of a look but don't touch game)\, and the fact you can't run or draw your weapon whenever you want (you can only do these when you're about to enter a fight scene).  I wish there was more fight scenes with the half-breeds/werewolves\, the few that there are\, are truly crazy.The length of the game is something else that doesn't really bother me.  I would rather play a solid 5-10 hour game than some 20+ hour game with filler and repetitive side missions.  There's a lot of other games out there that take less than 10 hours to beat\, I don't know why this game is getting so much flak for that?  I'm sure there will be co-op and multiplayer coming in a DLC pack\, hopefully for free?!This game isn't for everyone\, if you're looking for a run and gun\, mindless shooter\, The Order isn't for you.

It has the cover based mechanics over gears of war with the AI of Killzone wich means you cant stay hidden for to long as the enemies wil try to flank you and get to you.  Speaking of enemies those friggen shotgunner specialist are a god damn pain and need to be taken out immediately if you see them.

You then read the first chapter and you're thinking\, \""wow\, this could be the best book ever!\"". Then you read chapter two\, and it's the same thing as chapter one\, but toned down. Chapter three is the same. By this point\, you're asking yourself\, \""so yeah\, the first part was great\, but can I have something else now?\"" But chapter four and five are the same. At this point\, you're bored of the story. The characters are boring\, and the pretty cover art is a distant memory. By chapter six\, you've lost all interest\, and then it ends at chapter seven\, because the story is short anyway. The impression you're left with is that everything around the story was great\, but the story itself was abysmal.And thus\, The Order: 1886 joins the growing list of AAA titles on the \""next gen\"" systems that flatters to deceive. My guess is that only about half of those who play the game will have the willpower to finish it\, and only half again will actually enjoy it\, and those that do are those who value something that looks good rather than actually IS good.… Expand"

I found the technological  spin on Victorian London in 1886 to be thet most interesting setting I've ever gotten the priveledge to  explore in a video game. And without a doubt\, it has the best graphics ever seen in a video game\, it's obvious. The game looks like your playing a Blu Ray movie.Thankfully the story was just as good as the setting\, and it had very memorable characters. I especially liked  the main character and the 2 most prominent female characters. The acting is spot on and you just keep wanting more.Obviously the gameplay is some peoples primary concern\, and I had concerns as well but let me tell you what I was most blown away by IMO......The third person cover shooter  gunplay in this game is unlike  anything  I've ever played. It's completely  original IMO. You can't stay out of cover and  simply pick off your  enemy when he  pops out of  cover\, if you leave cover for more than  2-3 seconds on Hard\, your dead. Snipers are placed across the map that kill you in 2 shots. In order  to succeed  they give  you some pretty cool tactics.  Like the option to hold only your arm out of cover to just spray and  prey wildly\, I've never seen it emplimented this good to where it's not cheating. This causes  your enemys to either get behind cover\, or you may kill them if you  spray enough. The game places heavy damage snipers in certain spots\, and enemies with pistols and machine guns have thier positions. You  also can't just stay in one spot\, because the hard to kill shotgun enemys will charge you\, and if he hits you twice\, your dead(I play  on  hard).  Another thing different about the gunplay is the way  the guns feel and the strategy you have to use to be accurate with the weapons. The weapons  in this game are truly awesome\, they  are perfect. They feel like real guns\, they kick like real guns\, they are inaccurate like  real guns sometimes. With some guns you have to time your shot just right or you will just skim the enemy. The game also  has some truly unique weapons  that you've never seen before. And each of the 10-15 different weapons  has it's own purpose.Another part of the game I  was blown away by was  the different ways you can interact with the world. In some games\, if you  go up to a note on a piece  of paper\, the paper magically super imposes itself on your screen\, and you read it\, and then it goes away. In  The Order\, you pick up the note with your hand\, move it in  any direction\,  then when your done\, you place it back down. You do this with most physical items you can pick up in the game. And instead of just giving you a lock picking game like all other games\, you have a tool designed by Tesla to pick locks that feels like you are actually picking the lock\, not just playing a mini game. There are SO many items like this that you actuallly physically use in the game\, like the device you use to open the armorys designed by Tesla\, and  your monocular is also one of the coolest things. Everything in this game feels REAL\, I can't emphasize that enough. NO mini games\, NO menus\, NOTHING that would remind you that you are in a video game. And the fact that it's bug free and smooth as butter is truly amazing at a time when games ship broken.My favorite parts of the game was the stealth  section at night in this beautiful  garden in the middle of London while it's raining. All the  guards are walking around with  lights  and you can either shoot them with your very  limited amount of arrows\, or if you time it right\, you can melee your enemy for  a truly awesome and brutal looking take down. Another favorite part of my playthrough was walking underground beneath london\, they give you these lanterns and it's pretty damn  creepy   and the environment just sucks you in completely. I felt I was inside the game during these sections and it looked so awesome.If you want a game like Destiny\, COD\, or some other grinding twitchy  game. That's fine\, I sometimes like those games too. But every game doesn't need to be THAT. And if you want the usually survival exploration third person shooter like Tomb Raider\, The Last of Us\, or Uncharted\, those games are awesome. This game is different. You don't \""Level Up\""\, it's not \""Open World\"". It's The Order 1886.The Order  1886 is  an expertly polished\, truly immersive\, ground breaking experience that's never been done  before. It has original class leading graphics\,fresh game play\, and a way  of telling you the story never before exerienced in a video game. If you want an  experience you truly have never had before\,  I recommend you try The Order 1886.I rate games based on the answer to this question. Did the developer create the exact game they wanted to create\, without cutting any corners\, and perfectly realizing thier idea? Yes\, 100%.The Order 1886- 10/10… Expand"

Aside from the audio tapes\, which I assume are only collectible\, so you could listen to them again on a future play through.The button press\, quick time events (QTE) are many. I think I could have overlooked this if not for the fact that the \""boss fights\"" are simply an endless loop of cat and mouse until you sink enough bullets to unlock a QTE to kill the boss. Possibly the most unsatisfying boss fight I have ever played.The trophy system was the worst I've seen in any game hands down. I hit platinum in 2 days of playing (maybe 10 hrs) and I was going slow to observe the game's beauty.So with such negative feelings on the gameplay\, why a 7/10 you ask?

Some of the more extended cutscenes could have been cut in favour of some more action.The combat is fluid and pleasing and among the best cover based action games recently.  The weapons feel grounded\, though early on  woefully underpowered.  I was a little annoyed by the amount of shots to the head which resulted in nothing more than the enemy just shaking it off.  I don't know if this is because I was playing on hard or not.  Monster fights can be repetitive and tiresome\, for example requiring a QTE's to dodge at the right time rather than when you decide.On the point of QTEs\, yes The Order leans a little heavy on them but they rarely feel trivial.If you enjoy linear\, story driven gameplay then you'll get something out of The Order.  If you're a fan of cover based gameplay then you'll be right at home\, but may find it's pace and content lacking compared to the likes of the Gears series.  Comparisons have been drawn to the Uncharted series\, or The Last of Us which is fair as it's quite close to both.In short\, if you have patience and enjoy a slower pace marbled with pleasing gunplay then give it a go.  If you're looking for more action than story then give it a miss.  If you think that QTE are the devil then give it a miss.  If you think that COD is the pinnacle of gameplay\, give it a miss.I like it.  It's my cup of tea.  I wish to congratulate Ready at Dawn on their obvious labor of love.… Expand"

I can understand some saying the length doesn't support the price\, but honestly the production value in this game is more than worth your time and the price. Plus the game never felt short nor was it a short game. It holds an average time for a campaign and it sure did deliver. I understand the complaints for the quick time events as well\, but i never found myself hating them.

93914,Order1886,2015-02-25,8,"The Order 1866 is a lot like a Gears of War\, but it has the tunnel vision that Final Fantasy 13 brought to that franchise. Now I know I may not sound like I am reflecting the score\, but keep in mind there is more to read. The game has an excellent presentation\, Solid to Ok gameplay mechanics\, and a lot of empty. I will focus on the Good\, Ok\, and the bad in that order.The presentation is pretty much mind blowing\, and I own a ultra high end PC\, Xbox1\, PS4\, etc gaming system I have it. However\, the visuals\, audio\, and just atmosphere in this game is just excellent. I like the lore and due to the way it is presented this game is aching for a 2nd and or maybe even a third game. A lot of the times there will be a beautiful cutscene and the game will pan out to a gameplay moment and I am sitting there waiting for something to happen\, as I can not believe that this game is actually in real time. The cutscenes are great\, but what makes them truly special is the acting which is on par with some of the best movies. The visuals and sound leaving nothing to be desired its just that good.Gameplay is where the game starts to drag not because they don't work well or are sloppy\, but because utilization is not as deep as it could have been. The shooting feels as good or better then any cover shooter\, the cover system is the best I've ever used. However\, all enemies are funneled to their death and its just not enough or lacks any variation. The QTE are not all over the place as some had me believe\, but rather minimalistic and appear in appropriate moments. I wish there was a hand to hand combat\, and especially during spoiler**** when you face one of the lycans in the hospital**** I wish it had some sort of Batman Arkhan style combat system. Oh well its not bad just wish there was more and maybe more of a variation.Now my biggest gripe with the game it reminds me of the old school RE games on PlayStation one in a not good way. See the visuals are breath taking\, and the environments are amazing; however\, everything around you is dead... no pun intended. I mean Its all for show you do nothing with it\, and when there is a interaction or collectible there is no notification that this is something special you found. The level of detail is sickening\, and my biggest wish for this game is Sony allows Ready At Dawn to add some more menus and maybe a inventory system.I take two steps in the right direction and one back\, but overall I have had great fun with it and is an excellent show piece of what current gen systems are capable visually. I hope that on the next games my issues with lack of quantity or variety in gameplay is addressed\, and just maybe add a notification system when I find a cool item. This is a solid game and great entertainment and I will defiantly revisit it if any DLC or sequels are announced.… Expand"

I already saw them less than a day ago\, I'll have to wait a week or more to forget them so watching them again won't be that boring.Why am I complaining about this? Because the way RAD wanted this game to be - a game that is a cinematic experience\, ended up being a frankenstein-like creation\, cutting out chunks of gameplay and shoehorning in numerous cutscenes and scripted action. Then they have the audacity to market their qte's as a way to 'involve the player so they don't feel like they're just watching a movie'. Qte's work when they are on rare occasions\, not everytime your character gets into a fist fight animation.Why do I replay single-player games? Because it is a game\, not a movie. Games are different\, everytime you play it. Movies are the same every time you rewatch it\, but its story and quality are high enough to compensate. RAD wanted to make the game into a movie\, so they made the gameplay as linear as possible\, and segmented it with heaps of cutscenes and qte sequences. It's a game. I'm suppose to control the character\, not watch him be animated 50% of the time.Gameplay? It's very simple. The environments look diverse\, but the playspace is simply different combinations of cover spaced 3 metres from eachother. The AI rebels aren't very dynamic at all\, there's two types of enemies\, one rushes you with shotguns\, the other hides behind cover\, periodically shooting at you\, and is programmed to so nohing else till his death. And ways of taking down human enemies is the same\, even for pretty much every weapon - headshot them. A Halo campaign with only Grunts as enemies would be more dynamic than this game.Well I'm selling my copy. Next time I'll only buy games that have good gameplay\, because that is the sole purpose of a game - to be fun to play. A game with the best graphics in the world\, and the best story in the world is useless if it's no fun to play.If you want the story that much\, just watch a walkthrough\, and use your money to buy a fun game. Better yet just rent it. With almost zero replayability\, you can get its full worth after two days.… Expand"

It seems like people a criticizing the game for what it is not instead of enjoying it for what it is. If you are here to get an idea if this is something you would enjoy then you must first understand what type of experience this title offers. It is not an open world game with quests and side missions. It is not a dedicated 3rd person shooter for the competitive shooter crowd and it most certainly is not a game which offers multiple branching story paths. It is a very cinematic experience which strives to tell a very linear story in a very specific way. It uses phenomenal well written and brilliantly acted cut scenes\, a solid but not evolutionary 3rd person cover mechanic and very well implemented QTEs as vehicles to tell a very engaging story. So if you ever thought that it would be awesome to control an action move then this is your game. The presentation is flawless. These are CG quality graphics we are looking at here. And because the visuals and the atmosphere are so well executed I feel like the cinematic approach is fully warranted because for the first time a video game truly looks like a move. It was one of the best story experiences I have had in a game. This game is an experience that every true gamer should have. If you enjoyed games like Heavy Rain and Ryse then I feel like you will also get what this game is attempting to do and it does it better than any other game before it. This is without a doubt a title that will divide people and I totally understand why.

Make no mistake\, The Order:1886 is a truly next-gen game and a VERY good one at that. After completing the game today\, I can not figure out why the game has gotten such bad reviews. I think it is because in this day and age\, gamers have such high expectations that anything less than absolute perfection is trash to them. The Order:1886 is close to perfection. I'll list the pros and cons below:THE GOOD:-Is goes without saying\, the game is GORGEOUS. The visuals in the game are the best I've seen in a console game period. The lighting\, level design\, everything about the graphics in the game are top-notch;-The voice acting is perfect. You really feel as if the voice actors ARE the characters they are portraying. Everything from the performance to voice acting\, facial expressions\, are done perfectly;-The game has a huge assortment of weapons to use. All the enemies carry different guns so you're never forced to use a certain weapon for too long if you don't want to. Just pick up another one and go. On that note\, the guns FEEL and SOUND like they should. They're heavy. You can see the muzzle flash with each shot and the shell casing being shot out of the chamber with a little puff of smoke. It's awesome;-Enemies react to getting shot in various body parts. Shoot them in the leg\, they react to that. In the arm\, they react to that. Physics are also ragdoll so the enemies dying is realistic. The gore effects are realistic as well;-The game play IS PHENOMENAL. A lot of reviews online criticize the game for being too heavy on QTE's and cut scenes. I'll say this and take it from me: THE GAME HAS MORE GAME PLAY THAN CUT SCENES. The game ties the game play into cut scenes and it done perfectly. The QTE's for me were never an issue because whatever was happening on screen during the QTE was so entertaining;-The story is great and you really get into it. The game never lags along or has too much filler. From the start of the game it's action action action and the story never stops. This is made better by the incredible voice acting and performance of those playing the characters;THE BAD:-Yes  the game is short. My play through was about 6 hours start to finish and there is no reason to replay the game again except for the incredible story and game play\, which are both awesome. That being said\, you will enjoy your ride while you are on board because everything in the game is done so well;-Insta-fail stealth sections. If you are spotted by a guard during these segments\, you fail the level and must start over. Sneaking up to a guard to perform a stealth kill also took me a few deaths to figure out what was happening. You sneak up behind a guard and a blurred out triangle icon appears on screen. A circle closes in on the triangle icon and when the triangle icon lights up\, you must press triangle to perform a successful stealth kill. If you press triangle before the icon lights up\, you are spotted and the guard kills you\, making you instantly fail the level. The courtyard level towards the end of the game is my least favorite and is very monotonous. Luckily\, this segment is short and you're back into the action quickly.That's honestly all I can think of that I didn't like the game. The Order: 1886 is getting destroyed in the reviews by bog name publications but honestly I don't know why. This is a cinematic game similar to The Walking Dead games by Tell Tale. Some cut scenes\, some game play. This game has mostly game play. People claiming the game has 10+ minute cut scenes are flat out LYING. This game has a perfect mix of cut scenes to give you the story and game play that is FUN. Others may not be able to justify paying $60 for a game but in this case I absolutely can and I recommend anyone who likes good games to buy this. I promise you will not be disappointed as this game is truly one of the best games I have ever played.… Expand"

But these things are cosmetic and if/when a sequel comes out they can go back and be like\, \""hey guys this didn't gel with people let's do something else.\""Personally I like what \""The Order: 1886\"" is doing\, more so\, under the hood. There are no loading screens/times! There are scene transitions and cut-aways for story progression\, but no load times. We as gamers keep begging developers to make our experiences more fluid and less stop and go and when a game actually does this we condemn it for using tools like \""quick time events\"" and the like instead of sterile and stationary loading screens between levels\, cut scenes and the like. True The Order is more a cinematic experience than other games...it might even give MGS4 a run for its money...but isn't this the natural progression of our medium to being more interactively realistic and involving? Who wants to be jerked in and out of an emotional state of excitement from a pivotal cut scene to a sterile blank expression from a 30 second load screen?For a new IP title I think this is Ready at Dawn dipping their toe into the water before jumping of the diving board. Could there be more world exploration? Sure. Should we be able to skip cut scenes? I guess\, but other developers have recently had issues with that as well...*cough* bungie...but then the experience of this particular game would suffer because of how everything under the hood works. Does there really need to be a competitive multiplayer? No. Is this game a fun and entertaining distraction from the day in/day out rigor morale that is our lives? Hell yes! I for one can't wait to finish this game and start over again.The Order 1886 is a new game\, it's its own game. And I for one think it's worth your time.

93937,Order1886,2015-02-20,6,"I will start off by saying unfortunately a lot of what you may have read is in fact accurate.While The Order: 1886 is a graphical masterpiece it has far more in common with titles released by TellTale Games than it does third person shooters like Gears of War.  In it's brisk 5-7 hour run time (largely depending on player skill and the want/need to find the collectibles).  The gameI will start off by saying unfortunately a lot of what you may have read is in fact accurate.While The Order: 1886 is a graphical masterpiece it has far more in common with titles released by TellTale Games than it does third person shooters like Gears of War.  In it's brisk 5-7 hour run time (largely depending on player skill and the want/need to find the collectibles).  The game offers no incredibly noticeable difference in challenge across the difficulties nor does it present a trophy for beating it on any specific difficulty so feel free to play it as you see fit.Out of the entire run time  of the game approximately half of that time is not player controlled due to the use of frequent and at times long cutscenes (similar to the presentation in most Metal Gear Solid games)\, at times these segments will feature small interactive QTE's to keep the player invested but otherwise offer no actual gameplay.  The story is primarily told through these cutscenes and QTE's and as such they non playable segments are 100% unskippable\, meaning you must watch them\, all the way through\, every time you play the game...One of the major downfalls for me was I felt the game was more or less sold as a supernatural cinematic action game\, while the cinematic part is correct The Order features VERY little action and the supernatural aspect is almost non existent.  The same can also be said for some of the games more unique weapons as you find yourself using the same weapons for 90% of the already short actual play time\, only allowing for around 10% of hands on times with the \""cool weapons\"".  The game controls well enough as a third person shooter\, but I can not stress enough that for such a minute amount of gameplay time\, it should have been absolutely exceptional.The characters and atmosphere are the strongest aspects of the game outside of the graphics\, it made me frustrated that the narrative moved away from it's supernatural elements too quickly as I felt that was the element that really could have made The Order stand out from other third person shooters or cinematic adventure games.  I only hope that Ready at Dawn moves the series in a slightly different direction if the series continues and given the events at the end\, I would say it's entirely possible we could eventually get a sequel.To actively address the cinematic ratio black bars\, they did not hurt my experience with the title\, nor did they provide any benefit.  They meant absolutely nothing to me either way and did not effect the score of this review in anyway. The game is beautiful and well acted but none of that can change the fact it's just not very good.(Note: Any review under a 5 is an absolute joke and anything above a 7 is laughable and both cases should raise questions about the review/reviewers agenda.)… Expand"

It seems RAD developed the game in a way to push gamer to know that  Order is the best looking game atm\, and yes it is! there are parts in the game that are simply Jaw dropping in terms of visual presentation. but i guess having too much focus on this\, makes the game like walking in a half boring half fun museum. specially that story kicks off well and midway it becomes well .... lets just say so so.The Other part of the game is QTEs and gunplay\, some of the QTEs are fun but mostly they have overloaded the game with QTEs\, due to the letterbox presentation and almost there is no sense of gameplay sometimes\, u feel like its an interactive movie just like TWDs or Heavy Rain but the lack of meaningful choices\, 0 interactivity with the environments and a super linear adventure ( not necessarily a negative but it sounds like the game really sets u on a roller coaster ) makes it much inferior than those titles.Another part is the gunplay\, the guns are fantastic\, shooter feels so good\, but bad thing is that it ends fast\, just where everything starts to be very cool\, bang\, the game throws u into a cut-scene and it ends all the fun. (i definitely suggest you to play on hard so it takes longer for the fun to end) it is a shame to see developers preferred all the boring scenes to the cooler parts\, even facing half breeds (which is the coolest part of the game) falls pretty short. The game is designed in a way that wants you know there are cool things awaiting but in the end the outcome is not satisfying and all the cool parts are pretty short.I should say there are a few cool parts in the game\, shooter is smooth and nice\, atmosphere and the world is engaging but the content and overall balance of gameplay is lacking attention.definitely worthy of playing once !… Expand"

Following in the footsteps of the Evil Within\, it uses a letterbox presentation using black bars in the top and bottom to evoke a cinematic feel which in turn makes it feel more cinematic\, but detrimental to the gameplay as there is almost a lack of a HUD. The plot of the Order 1886 at its best feels like eating popcorn along with friends except I'm supposed to have a controller in my hands.  Alternate history London is a joy to watch\, but the gameplay restricts you to only looking at it as there is absolutely nothing off the beaten path\, if there was. So many times the game cuts between what is played and what is meant to be watched that is broken up by needless piles of QTE's which is this game's biggest sin .The characters are superbly acted though the writing is sort of hit and miss but then again is negated by some truly incredible voicework by the main protagonist. The shooter portions is solid\, but nothing superb though the excellent presentation makes some of the moments fiery for brief moments with the era-inspired weaponry. Finally\, the game hardly makes an effort  to do much more than tell its short story which took me around 9 hours to complete with no incentive to return.

Great directing\, wonderful art design on every level\, the voice acting is flawless (one of the best\, if you ask me) and also great character design with no typical stereotypes (particularly the  women). The characters are very well written and you will care about them till the last minute.But why oh why is the rest of the game so mediocre. And let me make this perfectly clear. The problem of The Order is not the amount of Quick Tim Events (QTE) or all the cut scenes (there are a lot\, but all are very very good and fun to watch)\, There is more gameplay that you would expect after all the negativity in last few weeks. But the gameplay is comepletely generic. The shootouts have not enough dynamic and the AI does not set you under pressure and always stay behind the cover. The presentation of the werewolves are underwhelming. No suspense\, no horror and the same attacking scheme every time (they run towards you\, short QTE\, they run away while you shoot them\, after not even 1 second they start running again. It is the same thing over and over). Especially the werewolves would have been a great opportunity for some horror elements and scares.Next are the weapons. In a steam punk scenario yu would expect some crazy stuff especially with Nicola Tesla in the Game. But no\, the weapons are all comepletly dull and generic. All your standard stuff like handgun\, MG\, Shotgun (except for the Arc Gun\, which shoots a focused stream of electricity). Why they did not use the scenario to develop some crazy steampunk weapons like the Arc Gun? The disappointment in this regard becomes mostly clear when you first enter Tesla's research laboratory. Now you think there will be great gadgets and inventions\, right? No\, you can not touch one if the great inventions in his laboratory (except one gadget which is used for a mini game throughout the rest of the game). And the \""greatest invention\"" Nicola Tesla shows you (this are his own words in the game) is a boring sniper rifle. Seriously? You are in Nicola Tesla's laboratory and all you get to see is a sniper rifle.The Order can not decide what it really wants to be. A 3rd Person Shooter a la Gears of War or a cinematic game like Heavy Rain. If the developers would have focused on either one of the sides the game would have been great.And here lies the dilemma. If you like a game with new gameplay aspects and a lt of surprises\, then you will hate The Order. If you like the technical aspect and great cinematic and well written characters you will love it.I think I am between those two sides. I hope The Order sells well and the developers can make a sequel where they can completely focus on the gameplay aspects. Because the artwork and technical foundation is great and I am looking forward to dive in the world of The Order again.… Expand"

Secondly\, the voice acting is superb. It also has one of the most unique setting I have ever seen in recent years. However\, besides these\, most other things fall flat. Firstly\, The Order: 1886 try to get many things merged into one together\, but none of them were really outstanding. Cover-based shooting is okay\, but generic\, weapons are overpowered\, AI is relatively not smart\, pathetic enemy types. Its stealth also feel half-finished. and I have no idea why they even include some puzzle-solving in this game. There is some great moment found in this game\, but they are very often too far between. The game also feels linear\, you are often forced to do what the game told you to do. You have no choice but to do so. Labeled as a cover-based shooter I actually spent a lot of the time watching cutscenes\, which is acceptable. You walk and initiate another cutscene\, well I don't really like that. This is also a cinematic experience\, as what RAD has promoted. Therefore they add a lot of Quick Time Events (QTE). I do believe that it can help players to further immerse into the story. However\, if every action required you to press button then it become something tiring. Most importantly\, I don't found playing this game fun. It is straight up boring. The campaign last for 7 hours\, which is short when compared with other games in the market. For a already boring game with such length\, a multiplayer option would be awesome as it can effectively extend the game's lifespan. Unfortunately it didn't has any. It is really a pity because it have a lot of potential to become a 4-player co-operative games. Even the gameplay aren't done right\, the story can still saves the game. It is pretty good and quite engaging. It also has a rich back story\, However\, for such as a short game\, the story is under-developed and there is a huge cliffhanger in the ending of the game. Disappointing. The repetitive color tone can also be a problem. It has made every places feel like the same. Overall it is Crysis 3 again\, another tech demo with superb graphics and pathetic length. While Crysis 3 gets its gameplay and multiplayer right. The Order didn't. To me it is surprisingly disappointing. It's hard to believe that the creator of Daxter and God of War will make such a under-performing game.

The single-button press QTE's are painfully annoying and any combat events are few and far between. Exploring is restricted to narrow paths and limited interactions with the environment.

Like\, if you've played Ryse then play this\, you will see exactly what I mean. One problem is that I'll be finally really be getting into combat\, and then it'll yank the control away from me again for a cutscene that you can't skip or look away from incase there's a QTE\, so it holds your attention hostage when it shouldn't have to. On the combat\, it could feel weightier and grittier. They've already decided on creating a gritty world\, but the combat doesn't match that. It feels the kind of game that would warrant a bit of gore\, as it would have fitting context. Honestly though\, it's the kind of third person shooter that ticks the boxes smoothly and that's about it as far as I've seen. There's honestly way too **** many QTEs\, it's as though Ready At Dawn tried to translate some of their God of War experience to this\, and they've brought the QTEs with them\, not realising that shooters like this work best when the firefights are frantic\, brutal\, and organically paced by the player and AI. The button prompts break immersion like a **** and this game needs every bit of immersion it can get.This game had the potential to be so much more\, but they spent too much time making a tech demo instead of a game.… Expand"

The main criticisms coming out of the press are aimed at the game play (or lack thereof) and also the story. In my opinion there are some grounds to gripe with the game play but certainly not the story. The order is a cover shooter and really wants you to know it\, in fact aside from Heavy Rain style QTEs (think press X to Jason) and a lot of walking that's pretty much all the game play you will be doing . There's absolutely nothing wrong with the cover shooting system\, it works very well and for the most part is pretty enjoyable\, but the thing that other successful cover shooters on PlayStation achieve is to have some additional elements to the game play. Uncharted throws in the odd bit of driving along with plenty of platforming and puzzle solving\, Vanquish had a suit with crazy abilities to add some melee combat in\, and games like Sleeping Dogs and GTA V have an open expansive world to explore with plenty of side activities. I'm not saying that The Order needs all or any of these elements but it certainly would benefit from the odd change up in a while\, hell even a levelling system would spice things up. On the subject of the story\, I haven't found any reason to find fault so far\, in fact I'm fairly gripped both by the topic and the performances. I'm genuinely interested to find out how everything unravels! The final thing I will mention is the graphics. I'm sure PC gamers will point out that high end PC's have been sporting these kind of graphics for ages blah blah blah\, but for console gaming it really is a wonder to behold. Be it a reflection in a window\, a cloud of smoke from an explosion or just the glow of a lamp in the dark\, the sheer impressiveness of the visuals is there for all to see!Whether or not you should buy The Order boils down to a few things\, if you aren't strapped for cash and enjoy a decent bit of story driven gaming then definitely check it out. If you are interested in experiencing the graphics and story but are unsure about the game play and the cost\, then wait to get a pre-owned copy (there is unlikely to be any worthwhile DLC to miss out on). Finally if your games collection consists of only FIFA and/or CoD/Battlefield then give it a miss\, you wont enjoy it and will probably spend the next month slagging it off on message boards!I hope this has been useful for anyone on the fence about whether to pick up The Order: 1886 this weekend.… Expand"

Because if someone followed the game from the announcment to the release that person must have known what the game will be like. I mean gameplay wise. If you expected a sandbox game with only gameplay\, you did something wrong. If you expected a cinematic expereince with lot of cut-scenes and QTEs\, than you will like this game a lot.So if you are the kind of person who like that stuff\, buy it. No matter what other people says. If you want only gameplay and not\, basically an interactive movie\, than don't go even near to it. I wanted a game like this\, so I love it's every aspect. I don't really care what other people say. The game is amazing for me\, and I hope if there will be a sequel in the future\, it will be the same. I don't want to see an amazing game's sequel like this to be ruined by people who don't know what they want to play... If you want to play a basketball game\, don't buy FIFA. If you don't want to play an interactive movie game with TPS elements\, don't buy The Order 1886!… Expand"

In fact\, this criticism put me off bothering to complete the game until today\, despite having bought the game at release.  But it's simply untrue.  If you were expecting \""and they all lived happily every after\""\, then yes you might be disappointed... but the story in fact closes in the most logical way\, given the direction it was heading.  It does leave open the possibility of a follow-up\, but by no means demands it.With that out of the way\, I really enjoyed the game\, despite its obvious shortcomings.  Besides the astonishing graphics and motion-capture (which still haven't been bettered on PS4)\, the story was original and the lore rich enough to allow me to enjoy the slower sections of the game.  Some of the weapons were really fun to use and the combat against human AI was always enjoyable.  The voice acting was solid\, and the music is possibly one of the highlights... I ended up getting the soundtrack album.In terms of story and replayability\, it is no more linear than Uncharted\, and I will certainly be going back to play it again to get the trophies I missed\,  perfecting my combat (I managed to finish the game without even being aware of the \""Blacksight\"" skill) and trying the harder difficulty setting.I was really only disappointed with the fact that there were too many quicktime sections for their own sake\, and some where missing them did not affect the consequences.  Also\, although I was happy with the length of the game\, I don't consider it value for money at its original price.  If you can pick it up for around £20/$20\, I think that's about right.… Expand"

The game SHOULD just be a DLC due to its short campaign\, you could easily finish the game in 2-3 hours if its not for the long and many cutscenes and QTE moments of the game. There isnt even any other modes to play in the game after you finish the campaign which makes it worthless if you dont intend to replay the campaign\, no multiplayer both online or offline or challenge mode or etc. Collectibles are useless and doesnt really show you anything that is relevant for its story. Though its not all that bad though\, the characters of the game are all good and interesting\, their voice acting are great\, and everyone has their unique personality to make them memorable for the gamers. However\, you were not given enough time to understand them more due to its short campaign. This part deserves a 3/10 score.Gameplay - The game is a interactive game with third person shooter gameplay. Its shoot and cover based mechanic despite being basic and ordinary is actually good and the melee fights are actually interesting\, though the QTE segment of the game really dissolves its challenge and fun aspect. Every QTE are easy and very dissapointing that was the mechanic used and recycled in all its few boss fights. Should've been better to focus more to being a shooter game than the interactive part.

No bugs or framerate issues\, clearly the game stands up to the expectations in this department.Concerning the gameplay\, most of the time it's a common TPS (you go undercover shoot the enemies that are coming in front of you then go to the next area) it's not badly done\, there's some nice guns but nothing is ground breaking and it lacks variety in terms of actions possible during those said fight. There's also a bit of QTE fights in the game\, that are welcome to change your habit and have more cinematic fights (a good thing they picked up from God Of War).But the main complaint I have about the gameplay is the level design that is way too tight for what I want in this generation of gaming\, people were okay with corridors in the PS3/360 era but now a great game must offer a minimal of space to the player.The story is pretty good with a nice build up\, an universe appealing and clearly detailed in the mind of its creators but the awfully short 6 hours of gameplay needed to finish the game is too short even for the story itself that is not concluded at the end of the game and it's clearly yelling for a sequel\, which is a bad thing considering such sequel is uncertain and I would hate to see this universe being waste just because they did a game too short because this is clearly the main issue of this game and if it would have last the required 12-15 hours for a solo focus experienced\, critics and sales would have been very different in my opinion.So in conclusion The Order is a gorgeously short common TPS with a good story\, that is fun to play for the time it'll last but not unmissable either.

From the brilliantly moody score\, to the unbelievably eye-popping graphics\, The Order: 1886 is an experience not soon to be forgotten. I was completely enthralled during my whole playthrough - which I managed to complete in one sitting. Never was I bored\, never did I feel like giving up.Yeah sure\, The Order: 1886 is not without its flaws. At times the storyline gets muddy\, at times characters feel just a tad forced\, and at times AI behave really stupid. Yet overall the experience was very enjoyable.I don't understand why people are giving this game such a bad name. The fidelity is probably the best I've seen in a game to date\, and the voice acting is top notch. Level design was engrossing\, even for a linear shooter. And the world was very well imagined and realised. I personally feel that Ready At Dawn did an absolutely fantastic job at bringing their alternate version of Victorian London to life\, although I might've loved to explore just a bit more of it.Some of the scenes in the game were indescribably beautiful\, such as the early morning by the docks\, overlooking the Thames. Shot setup and cinematography was also very professionally executed. And yes the game is cut-scene heavy\, I did however like the balance between firefights\, navigating levels\, cut-scenes and QTE's. I felt that as a whole it worked quite well. I did not feel that the QTE's were too many\, and they merged quite well with the game\, especially during the elder werewolf fights.If you want to be entertained\, and like the idea of a steampunky\, alternate\, Victorian London\, definitely give The Order: 1886 a go. If however massive games with unending freedom and deep RPG systems are your thing\, best give The Order: 1886 a wide birch.All in all I am very happy that I played The Order: 1886\, and it definitely reaches top-tier on my most unforgettable gaming experiences. I really hope that Ready At Dawn allows us to further venture into the world of The Order.… Expand"

The main character of the story is one of the members of the knights called Galahad in his battle against both half breeds and rebels and his discovery to the dark secrets of his own organization. The story of the game really has promise to get into that epic or masterpiece level but is far from that due to its very short campaign and the frustrating sequel bait ending\, they should have just finished the game from the get go to have the people to really love this game. The characters imo is also likable but their personalities weren't highlighted enough to show their strength due to the same reason that the whole campaign is so short it is ridiculous. Everything is affected negatively due to that. Therefore\, a score of 3/10 will do for that promising but dissapointing length of its story and campaign.Gameplay - The gameplay is your typical cover based third person shooter with added QTE cutscenes in game. As for me\, the gameplay is actually good\, the fighting scenes of the game in the whole campaign are all awesome and fun. The guns are also good and varies from each other. However\, what really lacks in this game is its replayability\, there are no more modes other than the main campaign\, no multiplayer\, no lan\, no challenge mode nor anything more to do after doing the campaign\, the collectibles in game are there but no really relevance since usually they arent that connected in the main storyline or anything. And another bad thing in the game is its boss fights which are recycled in the game and how bad the ai of the half breeds are that results in your fight against them to be very easy and predictable rather than you being afraid of them. Due to this factors\, it deserves a score of 4/10.Graphics - Now let us focus on the main part where the developers really gave their 100%\, its graphics. All i can say is that\, IT IS A MASTERPIECE visually. Everything is detailed from the smoke of London to its inhabitants\, the faces of each character\, the fall of rain in every object in game and how everything looks a big budget 3D film even in cutscenes\, qte scenes and fight scenes. There are zero fps drops and really showed how beautiful the developers want us to see in their game. It is one of the best looking games ever. Therefore\, it deserves a score of 10/10.Music and Sound - The music of this game is actually good with abundant use of piano\, violin in orchestrated style of music. I liked its soundtrack personally but lacks of that memorable song which gives me LSS. And as to the voice acting\, it is also top notched with how the accent of each characters really fits London and their times using old english terms and vocabulary not use anymore in today's era. Best voice acting for me is Lafayette and his great french accent. Due to this\, a score of  8/10 deserves its aspect.Total average = 6.25Despite its dissapointing flaws\, The Order 1886 imo is a good game. I really loved my short experienced to it and how i loved its graphics and its characters. I was dissapointed though that the developers are overconfident they thought that graphics alone can win them the fans. This game proved that grahics alone cant lift a game to be great. I really wish that if the developers has any intent to make a sequel of this game is that they should learn from their mistakes and give us gamers that masterpiece game they have the potential to do.

Very basic shooting\, and there is huge rooms for improvement\, as the shooting mechanics are a little too bare bones. When you're not in shoot outs\, you're probably platforming and climbing through the levels (which i actually enjoyed). Reminded me a bit of uncharted.Honestly\, I get that people feel that player choice was taken out the window and yes it can be cheap to press a button to get something to happen (mini quick time events) but it's done in such a cinematic way that it's not that big of a deal.I feel like the game was going for something different possibly\, and was suppose to be more of a point and click game (but with action segments) as it is very cinematic and seamless\, and the shooting scenes for me are just like part of the movie or something.

Meeting Tesla\, being a Knight of the Round Table\, the Steam Punk punk\, Vampire & Lycan wars\, Conspiracy theories (which are of course always true in gaming). The game felt like someone rushed to piece together all the big ticket games of 2013 + 2014 to make a sweet tech demo. There is shooting\, which I personally couldn’t get behind as it all felt extremely scripted and a majority of it goes into QTE that aren’t about measuring reaction time so much as making sure the movie you watch is very intense. Im going to go by the fact that as far as a 6 hour game is concerned I only need my controller half the time and of the time I was using my controller it was very minimal\, usually around 2 buttons or joystick only.  – 4 (No bugs or fails just boring)S – Sound quality was great but nothing amazing\, no amazing songs\, no amazing sound in all it was a very hit the AAA standard moment for them on this. – 6Graphics – They are definitely next gen and definitely console. It’s pretty\, however if this is a selling point for you then buy a PC otherwise you will be lacking on the greatest available graphics. – 6 Graphics are good but still console and still not anything awe inspiring when compared to last gen.Story – Ugh… Can we just call it a self-indulgent rip off of most every video game movie in the genre it’s trying to hit? If you are up on Pop culture of any aspect of the game it will have not one original moment and as with all video games the writing is just a bit clichéd and saddening only because it is trying so very hard. – 2  It has a story and they attempted to make it flow and makes sense minus the drop off of so many thing.Replayability – If anyone tells you this game has replay ability they are lying to you or they are trying way too hard to defend this game. Like all story driven games its really one and done. Most of the gunfights happen in narrow one room hallways or artificially opened corridors. It is very linear and defined\, It would be like saying you want to watch a 6 hour movie again that occasionally pauses the movie for you so you have to push play again. Once is enough for me – 0Though it averages close to a 4 Im docking 2 additional points for the developer’s reaction to criticism. The game is only 6 hours for them to say it was 10+ is an insult to gamers\, it means they assume were too dumb to follow written prompts or so desperate to explore everything that we will check out floor grain textures for 4 hours.

To answer that question simply it's a 'no' but really it's the wrong question.Developer Ready at Dawn responded by saying it was the quality of the game that mattered not the length. And the game is high in quality that is true but again that's still missing the point.The question people should really be asking is\, is the game any good? And as you've no doubt already seen my score your already going to know my answer to that.Graphically the game is high in quality both technically and artistically\, it looks great no doubt about it. But that's about all I've got good to say for this so called 'game'. For the record it took me around about seven hours to finish on normal difficulty but I was so bored I was glad it was short.I'd guess more than half of that time was spent watching cut scenes. Literally entire chapters would pass without me ever having control over my character. And when you are in control it's strictly on the games own terms. If the game doesn't want you to run fast or draw your weapon it will pull the rug from under you by removing your control. Ready at Dawn don't want you to go crazy and shoot up their nonreactive game world. They would much rather you walk around sluggishly and slightly rotate pointless objects.There is a couple of interesting weapons which threaten to be fun before there taken away from you the moment you get them but the gun combat itself is never anything more than average. Head shots feel strangely unsatisfying and enemies die almost as easily if you shoot them in the hand or foot. There is no puzzles\, platforming is the same as in Uncharted (i.e. not real platforming) and anything more complex is just dumbed right down to a quick time event (i.e. press button on screen watch something happen not real game play).Ridiculously boring cut scenes that drag on forever and mind numbingly dull item finding for the trophies kills dead any replayability The Order 1886 might of had. Oh did I mention the cut scenes are all unskippable? ...they are.The Order 1886 plays very much like The Last of Us or Uncharted 3 which is what Sony probably had in mind. But even by the low standards set by those games this is a step backwards. A complete lack of depths or development. Literally nothing to the game play to engage the player.… Expand"

No mechanics are expanded upon after their introduction and very rarely will the developers ever play with concepts that they introduce to the player. It becomes incredibly repetitious.

The setting is amazing\, but it is never really utilized as anything more than a map to shoot enemies in\, which again is disappointing considering how well done the technology and folklore elements are utilized in the game. The characters have a load of potential\, and some are interesting (well\, they are teased to be interesting at the very least)\, but again they are only really utilized as friendly NPCs to soak up bullets and for the occasional party banter. The game misses the mark on almost ever conceivable category apart from the visual and sound design.It's disappointing because I really wanted to love this game. The 'alternate history' time period\, mythological elements\, and characters offer so much potential\, it is so disappointing to see the game be handled how it was. The relationships between characters are teased\, but never fleshed out. The conflict that you're taking part in gets more interesting as it goes on\, only to be metaphorically dropped at the end in order to ensure the need for sequels and/or DLC. The Order feels more like what a Telltale game aspires to be instead of a 'AAA Story-driven shooter'.… Expand"

The art direction\, musical score\, voice acting\, scene setting\, cut scene transition are all exceptional and put most games to shame with just how polished they are. The gunplay is solid and the feel of the weapons is enjoyable and when big firefights break out they are really fun. Things are kept quite fresh with stealth and lycan fights alongside some diverse weaponry. The characters are well realised and the story is well set up.So with all this praise why only a 7? Well it just doesn't follow through on a lot of it's promise. There are quite a variance of guns when compared to most shooters but ultimately you will find most battles are easily handled with the standard Assault Rifle. The story is exceptionally well crafted with various groups coming into the mix creating an intriguing cross section of political and emotional suspense\, but then it just goes and ends. I wouldn't say the ending was disappointing but it could have been a lot better. The action pieces are great but there are too few of them and they are unnecessarily interrupted. I feel that if RAD take on board the criticisms levelled at the game and create a more expansive free flowing sequel it cold be up there with some of the greatest games ever made. As it stands though this is a throughly enjoyable but ultimately flawed game. If you have the money\, and the time\, it is well worth your attention\, but it is far from unmissable.… Expand"

93623,Order1886,2015-03-01,9,"This afternoon I finished the Order 1886\, and I more than just enjoyed it. I enjoyed it so much I felt compelled to write a review\, and champion ready at dawns piece because I have never in my twenty plus years of playing video games\, seen a game so underrated and misrepresented.So\, what's wrong with the game? - Not all that much to be honest\, but let's lay the games flaws out.This afternoon I finished the Order 1886\, and I more than just enjoyed it. I enjoyed it so much I felt compelled to write a review\, and champion ready at dawns piece because I have never in my twenty plus years of playing video games\, seen a game so underrated and misrepresented.So\, what's wrong with the game? - Not all that much to be honest\, but let's lay the games flaws out.Firstly\, It has a shaky\, and rather ill paced\, quick time heavy first hour or so. This rather misplaced slow burn made my heart sink at first\, as I thought that all the criticism laid at the game was founded. Once the game gets going\, and you settle in to the first real firefight\, the adrenaline really ramps up and the game just gets better and better. The other negative is the lack of variety in enemies\, which I do think could have been far more varied and taxing. Also\, the Lycans are far too easy to despatch once you get their patterns down.That's it for the negatives I encountered\, but what about the cons the critics seem to level at the order 1886?You may have heard that this game is extremely short...I did not find this to be the case what so ever\, and I clocked the entire thing to take the best part of 10 hours\, which is perfect for a heavy\, narrative driven experience. Narrative driven games like Alien Isolation really do outstay their welcome when you go clocking up to about 15 hours or so of game play.You may have heard it has little replay value\, a statement I find stunning as I will without question play the game through again\, and cannot wait to in fact\, as well as take on the hard mode. The final\, and most baffling game play criticism was of the games stealth moments which people found clunky. How? Why? I have no idea\, as I have zero issue manoeuvring them and I am in no way an expert gamer. In fact\, one of the later missions (no spoilers) which relied heavily on stealth was a particular favourite of mine.However...The game has positives in spades. You all know how incredible the game looks graphically\, and you will find yourself stopping to marvel at tiles on a wall\, or wallpaper (something I've never done in any game) but graphics are not everything without gameplay\, and the order delivers with solid\, heart racing firefights\, a truly sexy array of weapons to get stuck into\, and one of the most engaging storeys I've encountered in a video game since the Last of Us. Honestly\, I am still thinking about the storey\, and want to reply again and experience the game a new. I'm also hungry for a sequel. Stunning\, solid and totally misunderstood by people who won't give it a go\, the order 1886 is a game where people I know who've played it love it\, and people who haven't are wary.It's a rare bird\, and it's uniqueness in appearance\, and setting is another rub of the game - If you're a bit of a geek\, and love high conceptual settings\, elegance\, and interesting lore\, you will love the game and find it engadging\, and actually thrilling at times\, but if you're the kind of person who likes your games rooted in some kind of reality\, and have little to no interest in the setting\, and overall look of the game but fancy giving it a play regardless - don't. You need to want to invest yourself in the setting\, and the characters. You need to want to have an immersive\, atmospheric experience rather than just another first person\, or driving game to pass the time. The only true crime of the order 1886 is how astonishingly harsh the critics have been to it.PS - I am not a sony fan boy.

TheHere is my review of the PlayStation 4 exclusive -- The Order 1886:Background and Coverage --> Due to its status as a new IP\, I did not have prior knowledge about the way in which the game is going to play out.Story --> The player assumes the role of Sir Galahan\, a knight within a group called the Order that tasks you to protect humanity from the half-breeds (i.e. werewolves). The entire narrative is set in Ready at Dawn's fictional version of London a few clichés that are typically presented in werewolf-infested stories. With that being said\, your peer-to-peer interactions are your primary source of understanding the lore in which the developers have decided to drop you and enable you to be fully immersed in it. Whereas Destiny introduced a new universe that was not adequately explained\, Ready at Dawn did an excellent job with the introduction of the Order 1886's unique world and one which you will be eager to return to in the inevitable sequel.Sound --> The sound design of the Order 1886 is phenomenal. The weaponry\, both modern and fictional\, are spot on and when you use them\, it is apparent what kind of damage they will surely do. The werewolves' growls invoke a sense of tension and the voice-actors should be commended as the title has what can quite arguably be the best voice-acting on the next-generation consoles thus far (I am aware that the PlayStation 4 also has \""The Last of Us Remastered\""\, but it is a game that was originated in the PlayStation 3). The emotions that the characters are trying to illustrate are clear and the facial animations\, which I will further discuss in a little bit\, bring the imaginary individuals to life. As far as the music is concerned\, it is top notch and if you are a fan of dark-toned and\, quite frankly\, fear-invoking tunes\, then you will enjoy the game's music design.Graphics --> If I could summarize the title's visuals in one word\, it would be \""stunning\"". The game's pacing is deliberately slow in certain points\, which enables you to embrace the incredible world that Ready at Dawn has created. The environments are awe-inspiring\, the monsters (with a special shout-out to the transformation animations) are spectacular\, and the humans with their respective facial animations and lip syncing\, are quite a sight to behold. In a similar manner that people bought Killzone Shadow Fall to showcase the \""graphical fidelity\"" of the next-generation consoles\, the Order 1886 stands head and shoulder above every other next-generation game as the new standard for upcoming titles to surpass when it comes to visuals. Side note -- frame rate is a smooth 30 frames per second.Gameplay --> Most of the title's gameplay mechanics can be found in typical third-person shooters. However\, there are a few additions that are appropriate for the setting that Ready at Dawn has delivered to the consumer. You are able to use either modern weapons (hand-guns\, automatic rifles\, shotguns\, etc...) or fictional weapons (thermal and \""electric\"" guns\, for example)\, as well as a couple of mini-games with regards to lock-picking and overriding electric circuit. While the gameplay feels great\, it is in this department that the game takes a turn for the worse. It is clear that Ready at Dawn focused a considerable amount of time on the technical aspects of the Order 1886 and it is unfortunately apparent that there is a higher emphasis on cut-scenes over gameplay. It is amazing to witness the smooth transition between cut-scenes and actual gameplay\, but I felt as if I watched the game more than I played it and there were certain cases where entire chapters were solely cut-scenes. The other issue that I have with the title is the over-abundance of Quick Time Events. I did not held a grudge over this aspect during the story; but rather in the end when you fight the final boss. As far as I'm concerned\, final bosses that can be beat by mainly performing quick-time events is lazy and something that I hope disappears in the near future. Aside from these two points\, the game is a good time and a good choice for trophy hunters due to the ease with which you can platinum the game.Longevity --> The most prevalent problem with the Order 1886 comes with its replay value\, which is none-existent. Aside from re-playing the story and collecting all the newspapers\, audio-logs and objects\, there is nothing to do after the completion of the story. There is no multi-player\, co-op mode or new-game plus mode. As good as this game is\, the one aspect that is holding it back from being recommended for the full $60 asking price is its absent replay-value.Overall --> The Order 1886 is a game that should be experienced by every PlayStation 4 owner. However\, I would wait until the game has a $20/$30 discount before purchasing it.… Expand"

I put this down to the type of people reviewing the game (obviously). If you're a die-hard gamer who needs constant action\, and a real challenge then this game isn't for you. This game is not perfect\, but it most certainly is not as bad as it's made out to be.If you're someone who\, like me\, doesn't have all the time in the world to play a game\, but still has some time to put aside for a little gaming - then this game might just be what you've been looking for. It's not overly difficult (I finished it on Medium) and it's not overly long. Some parts of the game remind me of old Sega MegaCD/SegaCD games where you interact with a cut-scene (In my opinion\, much better than games where you're forced to simply watch and not push buttons). If I were to compare it to a game that plays in a similar style then I'd have to say Kane and Lynch 2.The real enjoyment from this game comes from the story and the action. The story is enticing and the action is a blast. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the cover shooting and running and gunning. I'm generally not a fan of the 'regeneration' heath mechanics\, but in this game it was fine.If you're on the fence about it\, then there would be no harm in waiting for a price drop (or getting a pre-owned version). I can understand why some people may not be happy paying full release-day prices for this title given it's short length (about 6 hours) but for me it scratched every itch I had.Lastly\, as I'm sure you're probably already aware\, the graphics on this game are beautiful. No doubt the best I've ever seen. As a PS4 exclusive\, It shows the potential of the PS4's hardware and an in-sight on what we can expect in the future.… Expand"

I was thinking why do they make the campaign so long/ I just want to see the ending...I didn't want to praise the graphics as it has been celebrated again and again and has become so boring. But it is stunning. Absolutely staggering. Definitely a treat for your eyes.However as a movie-like game\, the plot is mediocre and did NOT utilize the background very well. Vampires\, lycans\, 1886's London\, steampunk. They could definitely done better. Plus they ended it with the primary antagonist still at large\, it's like screaming: we'll make a sequel... hate it! That being said\, the campaign is still a good one.Shooting is alright. Actually more than alright. The shooting is a lot of fun. Typical TPS shoot from cover along with cool bullet time and new guns. Enemies are predictable but dangerous nevertheless\, especially those helmet guys and shotgun specialists.I tried to consider this as Heavy Rain or Beyond Two Souls packed with more action. But the story is not nearly as good. And as a shooter\, CoD provides a fun multiplayer mode after an equally good campaign. No matter how you look at it\, 1886 is an OK game but not worth 60 dollars. Buying a used one and selling it after finishing the story or getting all the trophies (which would not take much more time than finishing the story) would be a wise choice.

As of right now it has no peer in the video game industry.  Truly a ground-breaking game in terms of production value.   The game flows seamlessly from cut scenes to game action\, and there is no visual drop off because all of the cut scenes were made with the in-game engine.The artistic detail of the characters\, their clothes\, the environments around you… all stunning to look at.  This stunning visual presentation is also matched by amazing audio.  The character acting\, the symphonic musical score\, the sound effects of the action sequences… all of the audio presentation is astounding.  I found that this peerless production value really lent to an incredibly immersive experience.  This game is extremely atmospheric; Ready at Dawn did an amazing job of creating late 19th century London with a twist.  One word can best describe the presentation value of this game:  STUNNING.If you love movies and like a cool supernatural story then The Order is for you.  This game was clearly intended for lovers of cinematic gaming experiences.  The pacing and presentation of the game is very much in the Metal Gear Solid 4 mold\, i.e. lots of cut scenes interlaced with gameplay sequences\, flowing back and forth between the two and playing out like an interactive movie.  If you’re a bro-gamer and just want to shoot dudes online then move on\, this game isn’t for you.  If you love movies and enjoy extremely well done cut scenes and want to experience a great cinematic experience then this game is what the doctor ordered.The plot starts out mysterious and sets you out on a path of investigation\, trying to get to the bottom of apparent conspiracy.  There is a very cool supernatural theme to the story\, and there was a definite “oh snap!” surprise reveal in the middle of the game that was particularly cool.  No story is worth a salt without great characters\, and this game has great characters in spades.  I particularly liked the main character\, Sir Galahad.  Great acting performance… GREAT character.  All of the characters are brought to life by superb\, Hollywood-quality acting and cinematography.  All of the cut scenes felt like a dope Hollywood-quality movie.  The dialogue was very well done\, no cheese which can often be abundant in video game dialogue.On the negative side\, I did find the ending of the game a bit abrupt and open-ended... and the game was too short!!  I finished it in 7 hours.  I would have really loved to have seen this game more in the 10-hour mold.  The game was so enjoyable that I simply wanted a little more!There was clearly an intention by Ready at Dawn to leave things wide open for future sequels.  This game definitely feels like the beginning of a franchise\, and I know Ready at Dawn has stated they intend for it to be such.  The story for 1886 was awesome overall and does a very entertaining job of introducing you to this amazing world that Ready at Dawn has built.  Here’s hoping sales are strong enough for Sony to green-light another game and allow Ready at Dawn to continue fleshing out this dope universe they’ve created!  I wanted more!GAMEPLAYThe Order has been much maligned for being a “Gears of War” clone.  I find this amusing as many other games have borrowed from the 3rd person cover-shooting formula that Gears pioneered.  Uncharted\, Mass Effect\, Splinter Cell\, The Last of Us come to mind.  At this point in the industry the 3rd person cover-shooter is a well-established gameplay formula and genre and I find it truly incredible that many in the industry simply wanted anything and everything to levy against this game by using this tired critique.It is true that the gameplay in The Order is in the Gears of War mold.  As stated\, so are many other games.  What is more important to note in my estimation is whether or not that gameplay formula was executed well.  I’ve played other 3rd person cover shooters that felt cheap and under-polished.  The gameplay here feels really good\, very polished.  The cover works well and the guns feel great.  Adding to the quality of the gameplay was the amazing production value.  All of the action had a very visceral feel with all the great-looking gun effects and explosions.  I also found the guns felt great and were fun to shoot.  There was definitely a 19th century steam-punk feel to the weaponry.  And I have to give a special shout out to the Thermite Rifle.  This was my favorite gun from the game and was easily one of the coolest and most innovative guns I’ve even seen grace a shooter\, ever.  The Thermite rifle was amazing!OVERALL SUMMARYI really\, really enjoyed this game.  It was right in my wheelhouse as I love cinematic gaming experiences and 3rd person cover-shooting gameplay.  The story… the great characters… the immersive atmosphere… the fun gameplay… all of this  kept me fully engaged and hungry to keep playing to find out what happens next.… Expand"

Everything in this game is exquisitely detailed\, and you might just spend a few minutes admiring the game's impressive graphics.That's because\, after playing this game\, you might looking for any excuse to be able to play this game for a little longer. I completed the game in 12 hours. No\, I don't mean that the story took me 12 hours to finish -- I mean that it took me 12 hours to get the Platinum Trophy. And of those 12 hours\, I probably spent about four of them looking at cutscenes.The game is split into 16 \""chapters\,\"" but some of these \""chapters\"" have no gameplay at all. For example\, you don't encounter a single enemy at all in Chapters VI and VII\, as they're almost entirely composed of just story-related scenes. While the story is actually pretty good\, and the cutscenes are very well written and acted out\, I felt as though the developers ran out of good gameplay ideas and decided to put in as much story \""filler\"" (i.e.\, long cutscenes) as possible. Also\, some plot lines are left intentionally unresolved\, so expect \""The Order: 1887\"" to be released in the next couple of years\, if this game sells well.As for the gameplay\, or what little of that exists\, it's very well-executed. It does its job as a third-person shooter and there are some elements that surprised even me. For example\, sometimes nearby grenade explosions were powerful enough to actually knock me out of cover. You'd never see intricate little things like that in games like \""Call of Duty.\"" Also\, some of the fictional weapons\, like the Thermite Rifle\, were very cool\, which added to the disappointment I felt when they were quickly taken away from me.However\, there are some gameplay downsides: there are a LOT of QTEs\, and the game's fights with lycans (werewolves) -- beasts that the game presents as very powerful and hard to kill -- are trivially easy. Just constantly mash X. You'll never lose. Further\, I absolutely dislike stealth sections in video games\, but even I found the stealth sections in this game to be ridiculously easy. (The enemy didn't check around the corner? Really?) Also\, I should add that there's no multiplayer mode\, which might disappoint some players (though not me).All in all\, \""The Order: 1886\"" is a game that shows great potential that isn't put to adequate use. It does what it does really well\, but it makes you wish it did more. It leaves me both unsatisfied and looking forward to a sequel. How many games do that?… Expand"
93649,Order1886,2015-02-27,7,"Gameplay: 6.5The aiming and shooting in this game are not amazing but it is still fun and not clumsy or too slow like some other games. The cover system works great when your running to cover and shooting behind cover but could be more fluid when going from cover to cover but that isn't a big issue when fighting. There are QTE in this game but they aren't overwhelming like people make them out to be and don't take away form the game except for the last fight which should of been a lot better. The fights in this game are not boring and one of the areas had 40+ enemies to fight but since the game is short some of the fights against the Lycans could of had more variety. There are 16 weapons and they are all were fun to use. Other reviews on the internet have bashed the game for its cover system and shooting but they were either expecting the next Call of Duty or just over exaggerated because they feel wronged by the game being short.Graphics: 9.5Best looking game on consoles right now! There were some minor areas that had low resolution textures but the game looks very realistic and the developers spent a lot of time adding all these little details to make the atmosphere of the game feel like Victorian London and that alone makes this game worth playing but not for $60.Sound: 9Not much to say here\, the sound quality is great in this game.Story: 7.5The characters are all great\, they have distinct personalities and for the most part are well written. The story is good but should of been better. The game will probably have one or two sequels from the ending. The problem with the story is this was meant to be the first part in the series and either due to budget\, time\, or disc space limitations i think some parts were cut for the next games. In the beginning the story is progresses nicely and the questions start to arise but towards the end when they get answered some motives aren't fully explained and at the end there is a possible stupid move by the main character. I say possible because in the next game we would see the outcome and where they plan to go from there. I think they could of added more to make the story more memorable but with where they can go in the story in the future i would still say play the game for the sequel. The story is short\, it's about 5 hours if you rush through the game without collecting the items around the game and rushing through the fights without taking in the story. The items in the game do add a little to the story so i would recommend inspecting them because most are not hidden. I platinumed the game in about 10 hours so i would say 8-10 if you do everything.Lasting Appeal: 5.5Not much to do after you beat the story unless you are going for trophies or have the dlc weapons to try out in the story. The story is good and has potential to be great going forward but right now not as memorable as it should of been.Conclusion: (Minor spoilers)I think the story could be great if they go to areas outside of London where the United Indian Company operates and since Tesla is still around he can design new fun weapons. The game is not as bad as some make it out to be but it should of been better. I would recommend buying the game if it gets a price drop or renting it and waiting to see if they improve in the next one.… Expand"

93657,Order1886,2016-10-13,7,While The Order: 1886 is a graphical masterpiece it has far more in common with titles released by TellTale Games than it does third person shooters like Gears of War.

However playing this \""game\"" to the end was still fun. The cutscenes developed a worthwhile enough story and there was enough gameplay that you didn't feel bored to watch that story unfold. The gameplay was simple enough but not so simple you felt insulted. I think any person could play this game and appreciate the blend of story and game integration. The game is very short maybe 7 or 8 hours tops however the story and graphics were quite decent. On the other hand for 7 or 8 hours of simple gameplay this game should not cost more than $15 in my opinion. I honestly can't see this game being played more than once. All in all I didn't mind that this game was made even though it was so simple my only concern would be not overpaying for such a simple quick game since it has pretty much no chance at enjoying a second playthrough. At a low cost i would recommend trying this it can easily be completed in the same time frame it would be to read a book and this in my opinion is a better way for me to enjoy stories since generally i do not ever read books… Expand"

I've been captivated by both the steampunk and gothic horror genres for a long time and blending them into a beautiful game felt like I just got invited to be the guest star in an orgy of lesbian angels.  Sadly\, I was let down.The game is pretty\, there's no denying that.  There were a few moments where I thought I was watching a cutscene only to discover that I was in control.  The characters all expressed their emotions well and the voice acting was pretty good all around.The atmosphere was incredible.  I found myself immersed in the world they'd set up while I was just standing there.  It was gritty and ugly and treated my like an adult which I appreciated hugely.  First game I\, personally\, have played where they weren't afraid to show you a naked person when the person should be naked.  Everything fit miraculously on this aspect.My problems with the game began pretty early as the understanding that I wasn't going to be actually facing too many supernatural enemies dawned on me.  I had hoped to be primarily facing such things\, like a steampunk Van Helsing\, but the vast majority of the enemies were boring old humans.  The only supernatural enemies you did fight were werewolves or \""halfbreeds\"" as they were called and those fights were annoying at best.  Oh\, quick time events\, they were everywhere\, so heads up.  Entire boss fights in quick time events and only quick time events.  Whomever made that decision should lose a job.The next strike for me was our hero's bizarre moral compass.  Melee kills were done with one button and resulted in fun and smooth animated takedowns\, so I used them with some regularity.  I noticed that on rebels and villains I'd just beat them ruthlessly.  They'd have survived most of the animations I saw even if without all their teeth.  But when I was sneaking up on guards who were (in the moment) on my side and just an inconvenience I was stab-happy and throat-slitty.  First time I shanked some poor mechanic who was just doing his job I began to feel like I might be the bad guy.The final straw for me was the story\, and there was a lot of it for such a miserably short game.  With such an interesting setting you should be able to really do some fun things and get the player involved\, but this game did everything by the book.  Most of the characters might as well have been wearing signs saying things like \""I'm going to die or betray you\""\, or \""I'm actually a villain\"".  It was very disappointing to see everything line up so predictably.  And our hero's moral dilemma was so obviously on it's way that I groaned when it finally got there.  Also\, loose ends.All in all\, the game was fun enough.  It was hackneyed and predictable and downright obnoxious in spots but it was a decent if disappointing amount of fun for the few hours it lasted.  I just wanted so much more out of it.… Expand"

Incredible talent used in creating this game look fantastic.+ Interesting setting and concept for a story. Alternative London with the history of the Knights of the Round Table sets a nice set up for the game and any sequels that might follow.+ Awesome arsenal of science weapons.+ Sounds and voice acting is top notch.Negatives:- Not enough background nor lore about the order and how they got to the point at the start of the game nor is anything really explained about the rebels or why they're fighting them.- Story is short\, lets be honest. I feel more development was done in creating the engine and graphics which left little time to create a more meaningful story. If they can improve on this for a sequel it could be a very worthwhile series.- One too many QTEs.- Narrow corridors make everything seem so claustrophobic. London never felt so small.
