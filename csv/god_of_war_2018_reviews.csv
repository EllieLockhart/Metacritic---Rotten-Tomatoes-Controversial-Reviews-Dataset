79007,GOW2018,2020-08-31,10,"Darn near perfect storytelling. I recommend checking out the Myths and Legends podcast before diving in to hear some good Norse stories if you aren't familiar with Norse mythology; its worth it to pick up on some of the \""Easter eggs\"" and foreshadowing if you want to really get invested in the story. Visuals\, graphics\, combat\, acting\, and story are exceptional."

79031,GOW2018,2020-07-28,7,"Non ho apprezzato il cambiamento della serie\, perché essa è stata snaturata\, tra combattimenti alla Dark Souls\, storia alla The Last of Us e banali parametri gdr che tanto vanno di moda in questi tempi\, God of War è l'ennesimo minestrone di cose ben riuscite in altri giochi negli ultimi anni\, e credo sia il gioco più sopravvalutato dell'ottava generazione di console.La regia è originaleNon ho apprezzato il cambiamento della serie\, perché essa è stata snaturata\, tra combattimenti alla Dark Souls\, storia alla The Last of Us e banali parametri gdr che tanto vanno di moda in questi tempi\, God of War è l'ennesimo minestrone di cose ben riuscite in altri giochi negli ultimi anni\, e credo sia il gioco più sopravvalutato dell'ottava generazione di console.La regia è originale e ben fatta\, i personaggi sono ben caratterizzati e la loro recitazione è impressionante ma i pregi della storia si fermano qui. La storia è annacquata e ricca di forzature che fanno girare i protagonisti inutilmente in tondo\, c'è anche un grosso buco di trama che porta a questo e nessuno ne ha parlato solo perché è di God of War che si parla. Se la storia fosse durata LA META' non ne avrebbe minimamente risentito\, anzi\, ne avrebbe guadagnato in ritmo ed intensità. Ma no\, dopo Uncharted 4 e L'eredità perduta perché non basare anche God of War sul ritmo di The Last of Us? Così spersonifichiamo anche questo! Bah...Il gameplay non è male ed il level design della mappa è ottimo. Ma anche qui sono rimasto deluso. Troppe poche armi e pochissime tipologie di nemici in un gioco che dura 40 ORE. Le bossfight della storia sono solo 4\, il che è vergognoso considerando che è un netto passo indietro rispetto al 2 ed al 3. E no\, il fatto che questo gioco sia un grosso prologo non giustifica tale involuzione. Tra l'altro una delle bossfight con una creatura enorme è gestita neanche fosse un gioco Ps2. L'esplorazione è in parte godibile visto l'ottimo level design della mappa\, peccato che si trovano da fare sempre le stesse cose\, ovvero gli stessi tipi di nemici che abbiamo sempre affrontato e scrigni ogni pochi passi che facciamo da aprire risolvendo enigmi in quantità davvero esagerate. Il ritmo lentissimo della storia rallenta anche l'incedere del gameplay che tutto ricorda tranne un God of War. La nuova telecamera non permette di avere un reale controllo del campo di battaglia e di certo non bastano gli indicatori sullo schermo o gli avvertimenti di Atreus per risolvere il problema. Manca anche il salto che limita la libertà e la varietà nelle combo. Una menzione positiva però va fatta per le bossfight delle Valkyrie\, davvero coinvolgenti sia in atmosfera che in gameplay (a differenza di alcune della storia)\, è un peccato solo non poter sapere qual è il livello della Valkyria che stiamo per affrontare se non ingaggiandola\, dato che poi ci si ritrova ad andare dritti al patibolo contro un nemico che bishotta o addirittura shotta e con pattern complessi che di certo non si imparano ad un primo tentativo facilmente. Belle anche le sfide di Muspelheim che ricordano molto l'end game dei vecchi capitoli.Graficamente c'è poco da dire\, e se non gli ho messo un voto più basso è proprio perché il gioco è sorretto da un comparto tecnico di prim'ordine che\, al di là di un campo visivo molto ridotto e qualche freeze occasionale nel passaggio da un'area all'altra\, restituisce un colpo d'occhio impressionante a media e corta distanza\, con animazioni fluidissime\, recitazioni ottime\, particellari mozzafiato e un'ottima fluidità anche su Ps4 Slim.Reputo\, infine\, questo God of War solo un gioco discreto che inciampa in troppe cose seppur dia una sensazione generale di buona qualità. Nel prossimo capitolo servirà necessariamente un arsenale più ampio\, una varietà di nemici ben superiore\, più bossfight principali\, una storia più breve ma più intensa\, la reintroduzione del salto e la possibilità di regolare la telecamera nelle impostazioni allontanandola da Kratos. Sono nel complesso rimasto deluso\, e mi dispiace visto che il primissimo God of War è il mio gioco preferito di sempre.… Expand"

The combat is also backed up with great exploration and thoughtful puzzles to balance it out and give a moment of respite. Great pacing.The graphics are incredible. We are past the point where pixel counting is important and the sheer artistry and skill on display from the developers is evident in every frame.  Big shout out to all the team at Sony Santa Monica for this breath taking experience that can't be forgotten.The soundtrack\, from Bear McCreary\, is meaty and memorable\, ramping up to epic when you want it to yet delicate and heartfelt for the (many) moments that deserve it.The story\, backed up with the wonderful writing and voice acting just ties everything together.  There was some noise when Kratos' voice actor was replaced and that Kratos was now a dad changing the character irrevocably.  These decisions are entirely vindicated\, it is a better game and story for both.Christopher Judge nails a more mature Kratos and works so well Sunny Suljic as Atreus. They are admirably backed up with the comedy relief and light hearted banter of Alastair Duncan as Mimir.  So many journeys I just waited to in the canoe to hear him finish another gripping tale.Pure artistry in every department.  Can't wait for Raganarok!… Expand"

The main story is great\, and it helps me see why the game was praised so much. In God of War\, the combat is solid\, the lore is rich and deep\, but most importantly\, the story is excellent. It feels very intimate and human in a game where you've got gods running amok\, dragons to see and a whole host of enemies that need killing. It really is a special journey\, and one I loved experiencing. Kratos is an excellent character in God of War\, And one who just wants to see his son be better than himself\, and to avoid repeating the same mistakes he made. Watching Kratos' relationship with his son\, Atreus\, develop through the game was really engaging. There's just one part of Atreus' character arc that I thought was rushed over a bit too quickly\, that being his more aggressive and defiant streak around the middle of the game\, but it's possible that there's more to it that might be explored in the sequel.Where God of War lost me a bit was in some of its side content\, which felt to me like unnecessary padding.  In a game with such a strong linear narrative\, I don't see the need for some of the additional content\, especially when some of it is quite grindy. Although the combat is cathartic and satisfying\, it alone isn't what made me want to play God of War\, so after I finished the main story I was done with the game. Others who were hooked by the gameplay may enjoy fighting all of the Valkyries and grinding through the realms of Muspelheim and Niflheim for armour and upgrades\, but personally I had no motivation to do so. For me\, these parts of the game clashed with its identity as a cinematic story-driven experience.I wasn't totally sold on the RPG elements either\, as they're another thing that just distracts you from what makes the game so good. They're not overly intrusive\, but the loot system feels somewhat unnecessary. That said\, you can get through the game easily without worrying about your stats and build too much\, so it's no big deal.Still\, this is a great game. It certainly looks amazing and utilises a one shot camera technique which blends cutscenes with gameplay to great effect. The character models are superb\, and the voice actors do an excellent job too. The side characters are also well done - Brok and Sindri are loveable\, funny brothers\, and Mimir is an insightful and witty companion.Overall I enjoyed my time with God of War. Kratos' journey with his son was one I thoroughly enjoyed playing through\, and as a newcomer to the series I never felt lost. The combat is fun thanks to the weight of the Leviathan Axe and the brutality of it all\, and the game surprises you time and time again with more epic moments. The excellent mythos\, gorgeous realms\, and visceral combat all sell the grand scale of this adventure\, and the writing\, dialogue and performances make the journey truly special. God of War ends in an emotional and beautiful way\, setting up a sequel that I'm looking forward to.… Expand"

It's visually amazing and it's a cool thing to note that this game is done in a entire single shot. The gameplay absolutely nails it\, a challenging yet very balanced experience with a well panned out progression system for Kratos and Artreus. Along with the weapon and gear upgrades being very recording and satisfying but not compulsory either. The game doesn't prioritize quests in the sense of a division between side quests and main quests as everything is treated with atmost importance and care put into each activity. From hunting down Valkyries to exploring the ruins of Midgard. What's also amazing about the combat is that it allows the player to get creative in their fight styles\, make combos and learn and come up of more effective tactics to take down certain enemies. Level design is very well made in this game from a gameplay perspective\, visual\, and story perspective. How smooth everything seemlessly plays out is something more people would give this game credit for. Now story wise\, it's absolutely brilliant\, it features a new chapter in Kratos's life where he's a more mature man yet the sins of his past still haunt him till this day and are a reoccurring barrier between the relationship between him and his son Artreus as their on a quest to deliver the ashes of his deceased wife to the highest peak of the realms. The story is a very personal one that tackles very mature themes such as parenthood\, closure and forgiveness. As well as the narrative being very strong in terms of how power can corrupt men\, leading to catastrophes in the world and how certain vices spread\, feeding into the cycle of violence. However there's no such thing as a perfect game\, even tho this may be kinda it\, the only con I can point out is Niflhiem\, not the best location in the game\, exists for a very grindy purpose and doesn't offer much\, and is designed just for the sake to frustrate you\, also I wanted more from Muspelheim\, it's just a combat practice arena\, the location deserves to be more than that.

80126,GOW2018,2020-10-27,10,"this game is my favorite game of all time. from the very start the combat is fun and diverse with heaps of option with different combos as you go throughout the game. imagine dark souls combat that is fast and fun and isnt clunky. as you get the blades of choas you unlock an entire new half of the combat system you didnt know existed. i sometimes go through the game again just to kill some enemies. i have seen some people complain about the trolls and the same kill finish animations but personally they are so good it doesnt get old.the story is complex and deep with a greater meaning behind it so it is always interesting. the ending is just incredible because you find out who atreus really is and the sequal potentiel is just amazing. going through a second time you start to find out all the little hints and knods to the big reveal at the end. this is the only single player game i have played where i got something new out of a second playthrough.the game looks amazing and the setting is perfect. however when you put a heap of different effects on enemies like fire and magic it becomes really crazy and messy with frame drops. the charcater models are some of the best i have ever seen up there with tlou. best acting in video gaes as well. the characters sound like real people and they dont sound like they are reading a script and instead feels like they actually mean what they say.you kill 3 gods magni modi and balder which are really good boss fights. the other bosses include the dragons\, trolls and valkries all being really good fights.the valkries deserve their own paragraph. they are one of if not the hardest fights i have ever done. 2 and a half hours to kill sigrun (the final valkrie). they are all unique with their attacks and they arent damage sponges and you are constantly on the edge because they are about to kill you.the soundtrack is incredible. they fit the setting and are all really powerful. they are only used in times when it is right and i really like them even though they are in old norse.overall this game is an easy masterpeice. there arent any major issues and this game deserved goty. as soon as i completed the game i played it a second time. it is only 25 (AUD) and is a bargain for what it is. i promise you wont get bored and it is a mustbplay for not just ps4 owners but for all gamers.… Expand"

80142,GOW2018,2020-10-15,10,"As a huge fan of the God of War series and The Last of Us\, I was really excited for God of War\, and seeing the many perfect score reviews come in made me drop everything to get it at launch. I knew this game would be different\, and seemed really cool. Well\, I was disappointed... a lot.The premise seems interesting\, where Kratos ventures to a mountain with his son\, Atreus. They clearly take a page out of The Last of Us' book\, but this is much worse. Neither of the two are as likable as Joel or Ellie\, and their relationship does not develop as well either. I don't want to sound like I'm comparing too much to another game\, but since they clearly used the other game as an inspiration\, it's hard not to. It is cool how the game is all in one take\, instead of having separate cutscenes\, and their are some interesting side characters\, but overall the story is not that great or even close to as epic as the older GoW games.I thought that the graphics were great\, with several beautiful environments and moments\, and the voice acting and sound design was excellent as well.Now then\, the gameplay. I didn't like it\, at all. The combat is clunky and dull\, where you have very limited weapons and fight repetitive enemy types numerous times. You mainly use one weapon\, an axe\, but it gets really really old to slash enemies with it\, throw it\, and do the same finishing moves over and over again. The boss fights aren't that great or exciting\, either. I honestly felt like the combat was like the Witcher or Dark Souls\, but more boring and repetitive\, reminding me of an early PS3 game.There are some complex puzzles\, new for a series\, that are relatively fun.… Expand"

It's also without doubt one of the best looking games of this gen.Moving away from the linear style of play of its predecessors\, GoW adopts a more open style that allows you to branch away from the story and explore the Norse world. It's not strictly an open world but more like the latest Tomb Raider games but this approach works perfectly for GoW.On the surface\, combat feels a bit dumbed down from previous versions. Combos are largely gone now but in there place their place you equip runes to your weapons that gives Kratos different abilities. This opens up various different possibilities for how to approach combat from being an offensive powerhouse\, a defensive brick wall\, a user of elemental power or just a well rounded fighter. This is all helped further by being able to chose what armor set suits your playstyle as well as being able to attach enhancements to further power up Kratos. You can also use Atrues to cause further damage to your enemies with a couple of power ups of his own. All of this actually goes to make the combat system in GoW the most in depth of the series to date.The GoW story is also one of the best told stories I have encountered in a video game possible only bettered by The Last of Us. It might not be the most imaginative\, basically being the story of Kratos coming to terms with his past whilst trying to bond with his son Atreus\, but the manner in which it is told keeps it interesting throughout the games 20-30 hour playing time with a good variety of humor and dark moments thrown in throughout. The motion captured acting is also fantastic\, especially from Jeremy Davies whose performance as Baldur steals pretty much every scene he's in.God of War is a fantastic game and should be on every PS4 owners list of games to play.… Expand"

La historia es inmersiva\, entretenida\, hermosa\, la más larga de la saga god of war\, que hace honor a su nombre.

El único punto malo de este juego es el reducido mundo abierto que tiene el juego\, hay mapas distintos\, SI\, pero eso no justifica las cosas que se pueden hacer en este mundo\, los reinos con los mapas más \""grandes\"" son midgard (el mapa principal) y alfheim\,. Luego de esos mapas viene helheim\, que es más reducido\, y muspelheim y nilfheim (los opcionales fuera de la historia). En los mapas hay cosas que hacer\, como abrir cofres\, entrar q cámaras ocultas\, que tienen puzzles muy divertidos\, también tiene las fabulosas misiones secundarias\, que lamentablemente no son tantas. Luego de eso el mapa no es gran cosa. Es un juego muy complicado\, tanto en combate como en puzzles\, pero si te lo propones\, te lo pasarás luego de un rato y será muy satisfactorio para ustedes.

80288,GOW2018,2020-08-04,10,"Let me preface this review with a bit of information.  I cannot stand the first three god of war titles.  I absolutely without a shadow of a doubt HATED them.  To be fair I was never a fan of the greek mythos\, but it just seemed like and edgy boi being and edgy boi.  I understood the premise in the first game\, which is why I played it.  My interest was nearly zero after it\, it's ending seemed to completely conclude itself  and story.  Then suprise! GOW 2\, this time it's personal.sigh.  ok i'll play it.  Didn't really need this\, kinda **** on the ending of gow but whatever\, nothing really special here\, more of the same.  Don't really enjoy it.  Friends are hyping it\, everywhere is hyping it.  Not hyped.  Angry boi is angry.GOW 3 This time it's 3 more times as personal than the last two times.Oooooh boy.  well it looked better\, and they did add a few new things\, gutting enemies was pretty neat.  Really enjoyed pounding zeus face in.  The ending was cringe as ****  \""Hope was inside pandoras box\"" oh my ****ing god please just stop now. Then Cringetos commits unalive but suprise he isn't unalived.or is he?  or... isnt he?  dun dun duuuuuun.Terrible.  would not play again.See that new GOW is on the horizon\, uh oh.  see Cringtos is older noticeably.  hmm.  see that there is a little kid who undoubtedly is blessed with LITTLE KID POWER (henceforth referred to as lkp) ugh. See that it is set in norse mythos.  DON\""T YOU ****ING DARE.  DON'T YOU MESS UP THE GREATEST MYTHOS IN THE WORLD (subjective and opinion based i know) this is how i felt.  Extremely worried.I bought it.  I love norse mythos\, but i was also deeply afraid of what they would do to it.  I avoided ALL GAMEPLAY before buying it.  Avoided any leaks. I wanted my own opinion surprised this one time.  (rare for me)I beat the game.  I did it all.  I fought ALL the Valkyries WAAAAAAY under-leveled.  I mean i was rocking crap gear\, hardly any health\, i should not have done what i did when i did it.  I fought Gondul when i was rocking at lvl 5 (its more of a gear rating if i think about it) point is\, i did not have a lot of anything.  Each loss made me better\, and boy\, she ****ed me up a lot.  But every battle less and less\, until i had her down\, i beat her as she beat me.  Like a little **** It was beyond satisfying.Let me stop here for a moment and let me say this\, Cringtos is no more\, now he is Kratos\, he has also put away the edgelord blades of professor chaos in favor of wielding something mythos appropriate and bad ass\, the leviathan axe.  I love it.  I cannot express how awesome it truly is.  wanna go hand to hand\, can do\, wanna use leviathan axe\, can do\, wanna shield bash an enemies teeth out the back of their skull? can do.  wanna use the cringe blades of cringe... ok...(you have to for certain things\, i avoided using them on anything other than puzzle specific blocks\, yup\, i killed the dead Frost hel denizens with my fists over those ****ing cringe blades\, i hate them so much)lets talk a bit about graphics.  MWUAH\, love emlets talk about control\, MWUAH love itLets talk about the world\, it's more open than any of the games before it\, and that does it a huge favor in my opinion\, there are side missions/quests put about that you dont have to do\, but are definitely worth doing\, you can chase them at your pace.  you don't have to fight the Valkyrie\, but if you do\, oh boy is is rewarding and worth it.  test your mettle\, do it.gameplay links to control\, i was satisfied with it\, i only didn't enjoy the forced use of the cringe of cringe\, that was disappointing to me.Story.  Kratos is now Kratos and not Cringtos lord of the edge.  He done a big oof and grown up.  Matured.  Found a wife and sired a son.  One whom he has a fragile\, delicate\, distant relationship with.  One whom he seems terrified to get too close too\, but set on ensuring will know how to live\, survive and one day\, become a man.  The love is there\, the emotions that are a mixture swirl within him\, yet he keeps them at bay\, fear of who he once was creating this large block.  Kratos is a god\, a god from another place.  Here in this foreign land where he has sought a new beginning his powers weakened to a degree.The depth\, maturity and growth of Kratos instantaneously caused a 180 for me on my opinion of GOW\, i experienced his angst\, his anger\, his rage  There was sorrow there too\, but it was overcome with the previous emotions that there was truly no appreciation in it.  not like this. i never got to see kratos try to be anything more than the monsters he was chasing and killing.  Now we inject humanity and wisdom that comes with age and experience.  Humbling and so ****ing satisfying.there may be a sequel in the works\, i wont spoil any key elements here suffice to say that this story did well\, beyond well. This superseded my expectations in every way.  I hope the sequel does not **** up and continues with this amazing new path.… Expand"

The single-take transitions betweenThis was my first God of War game I have ever played\, so before I started I tried to do a little research to get caught up. So I know bits and pieces of the series' lore\, but this review is mostly coming from a new GoW player.Graphics/Editing: 10/10Filled with beautiful vistas and exotic effects throughout\, this game truly exceeded my expectations. The single-take transitions between cut scenes and gameplay is an excellent element that was excecuted flawlessly. There are a few scenes that with the right sound system and TV setup\, will leave your house shaking and your mouth agape. The first boss battle alone is some of the best editing I've seen in a video game.Narrative: 9/10There's an emotional and effective story being told here. Yes\, the \""escort-your-companion-to-XYZ\"" style gameplay is very popular today\, and some will even say it's overused. But  I think it works really well here. The characters are driven toward their goal within good reasoning\, and I think the ending pays off what we're building towards well enough. And there are certainly some emotional elements incorporated that will hit you right in the feels.Protagonists: 10/10Kratos is one bad m*****f*****! The dynamic between him and Atreus certainly captured my interest early on. Sometimes their banter may get a little repetitive\, but I think it drives a certain point that eventually pays off in the end. The canoe conversations are a real treat too.Characters/Interactions: 10/10There are some really great supporting characters in this game that provide some real emotional swells. There's some great comedic relief amidst some of the side quests\, along with some real tear-jerker moments more centered towards the main plot. I don't think any important character was wasted\, which can be such an easy mistake when making (kind of) an open world game.Villain(s): 9/10The main villain in the game has an electric presence in every single scene and/or battle. The performance is truly an A+. A lot of the game's most shocking moments come from encounters with him (i'll mention that awesome first battle scene again here).Gameplay: 10/10This is where I've noticed I disagree with a lot of people. After spending a few minutes reading reviews\, I see the gameplay and combat getting a lot of negative comments. I would have to disagree. I thought that the combat in this game was among the best I had ever seen. It's fluid\, it's versatile\, and it's just god damn satisfying. I was impressed with the variety of different moves you could unlock\, and as you improve it only gets better and better. I never once thought\, \""Man this combat is super repetitive and boring\"" like a lot of the comments I've been reading. But maybe that's just me.All in all\, I thoroughly enjoyed God of War from start to finish. If I had one gripe about it\, I'd say that the \""open world\"" set up is kind of clunky. After finishing the main storyline\, I tried to explore a bit to finish some of the side quests and collectibles\, but lost interest pretty quickly.Overall Score: 9.5/10… Expand"

Not in just the combat but in the environment as well which is arguably the most stunning feature of this game. I can confidently say that I've never experienced a game with as much lore connected with its environment. There are grandiose statues everywhere which all have stories to tell and reasons why they are there. Even some of the creatures have an enormous sense of scale. It felt like I was really immersed in the world of Norse mythology.The characters are all unique and enthralling. Even just standing around or riding in my boat had me engaged in the conversations that everyone was having. This\, mixed with the environment\, made the story immersive. Don't go into this expected an oscar-worthy script but\, nevertheless\, it delivers on the feeling and emotion behind the father-son relationship.While the battles and cinematography felt amazing\, there were some animations that soon became stale. Specifically\, the execution animations\, and especially for trolls. I really wish they could've come up with a few more execution animations to keep things interesting. Additionally\, I delved into the harder difficulty (not the \""give me god of war\"" difficulty) and was sadly greeted with the classic sponge mechanic. The game is harder just because the enemies have more health. You don't feel nearly as lethal as on the \""balanced\"" difficulty. If they had left enemy health untouched but made their damage more lethal\, then I think the hard difficulty would've been more engaging.Aside from this\, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and believe it to be the defining game of the PS4. It will stand as an example for all semi-linear story games to come.… Expand"

I know the game was lacking variety in enemies and bosses but i didn't get disappointed because of that because fighting was so fun and satisfying. You could fight so differently depending how you wanna encounter the fights so i didn't care about the lack of boss fights. I also want to mention boss fights that game has are really well introduced they really get stuck in your mind and it makes you want to watch cutscenes again. I never felt like watching a cutscene more than once before but this game made me feel that thanks to beautiful voice acting\, beautiful score and beautiful writing.I want to talk about the \""open\"" world as well. These days every game is an open world game and it makes me sick just spending half my gameplay walking around the world doing nothing. However in this god of war the way that open world is made is so good. It is actually not open but feels open and full of content. You get around with your boat and when you dock it you know there is something for sure. Also when you get around its not just your character saying just a line once in a row to try and make you not bored of wandering around. The game gives you information about the lore more like the mythology and it's given you with a conversation so it doesn't feel like an audio book of norse mythology.Story is also another good part of the game the story telling\, unexpected plots are really good especially character development is the best i have seen so far.I would've given it 9\,5 but i cant so i gave it a 10… Expand"

You find items and gear with different effects and stats which also can also change your playstyle a little during combat.The axe is a great weapon for combat and the developers use a lot of it's potential to create new environmental puzzles.Exploration is very rewarding\, though some of the items found during exploration are not as good as other items i found while in some quests\, which made me not want to use said items found through exploration. Overall rewards found through exploration could be better and give a better reason to explore\, besides farming resources to upgrade or buy gear.Some of the side quests however seem prety weak\, as the player simply as to go to place A\,B and C\, kill enemies\, pick up something and return. Fortunatelly\, and unlike other games\, there are no repetitive side quests. The are also repetitive  bosses.The art and environment of the game is phenomenal. Norse mythology provides some of the most beautiful and imaginative worlds seen\, from fauna to architecture. However\, there are also places that seem a bit stale and contrast with the other beatiful places.Graphics are amazing\, and if you have a ps4 pro\, you can play the game above 30 fps\, but dont expect constant 60 fps\, as the framerate varies a lot. Character models are very detailed\, animations are excellent and to match the extraordinary tone of Norse mythology\, a lot of particle effects are used\, creating a sense of magic\, along with other elements that could only come out of the kingdom of Odin.Finally\, the story is simple and\, at first\, does not seem that interesting as the other God of War games: carry the mother's ashes to highest point in the realm. But it's all about the journey of Kratos and his son Atreus\, the characters they meet with along the way (all amazing characters in their own way)\, the hazards and dangers they have to go through and how their relatioship changes as the game progresses.Accompanied with a soundtrack that fits each moment of the story and some of the best jaw dropping custscenes with a quality and a sense of enjoyment some movies whish to achieve\, you will want pause to take a screenshot or record what is going.It is an experience unlike any other\, full of tales from gods and magic from norse mythology\, amazing scenarious\, well directed cutscenes and voice acting\, and a journey between a father once consumed by rage and his son\, God of War is amazing from start to finnish. I recommend checking the story from the previous games if you haven't played the other games.In the end\, the only bad things in this game are very small compared to what it gets right!… Expand"

There are certain attacks that you do at easier difficulties that no longer work on them at higher levels\, which is pretty neat\, and shocking\, when you are in the middle of battle and expecting your attack to work.

A \""soft\"" reboot like this has rarely been done in other mediums before. Just listening to the characters discuss the loreBest game of the PS4 and arguably of the whole generation (2013-2020).STORY -The story is great and reinvigorates the franchise with a new pantheon of gods while retaining elements of what made the original series great by showing us glimpses of Kratos' past. A \""soft\"" reboot like this has rarely been done in other mediums before. Just listening to the characters discuss the lore makes you want to go read Norse Mythology. The voice acting and motion capture are probably the best of this generation in story based games (only second to the Last of Us Part II). The soundtrack is phenomenal too\, and it's epic in a more adventurous way compared to the dreadfully epic soundtrack of the old games.GAMEPLAY and Graphics -The gameplay is also reinvigorated. An over the shoulder camera makes it jarring for long time fans of the franchise\, but there are many thing in the game that ease the user into it. Movesets and enemy types are varied although there are quite a few reskinned mini bosses\, but there are several standout boss fights that are fun and replayable. The combat is also very smooth and polished\, but it's not as easy to do complex chains of moves as it is in the previous games. You need to play the game and really know how the weapons\, skills\, and special abilities work in order to craft the familiar long combos. This isn't a criticism but more of a thing worth noting.As far as hitboxes and smoothness of animations goes\, the game is very polished. I personally had zero issues in over 100 hours of gameplay\, and I used my day 1 base Ps4\, not even a ps4 pro. The game still looks beautiful on just a 1080p output\, and frame-rate rarely drops significantly (there is one \""challenge\"" stage where this occurs in just one occassion on my 100% playthrough).Open world/ RPG elements -The game is semi-linear in that you can explore the world instead of doing just the main story\, and the side content (while not being expansive) is fun and refined\, and the character dialogue and exposition fits neatly into the greater narrative and gives you information you really want to know before you play the sequel to this game. This is a much fresher experience compared to typical bloated low quality side content in generic open world games.There is only one set of collectibles in the game that have no real significance\, but there are only 50 of them\, and they're not hard to get\, so that's the only \""annoying\"" thing to deal with if you wish to 100% the game. You can also customize your gear\, and story and side content being increasingly hard makes this necessary\, and progression feels more natural although it's not a full on RPG like Witcher 3 in terms of the depth of customization.OVERALL-This game doesn't do anything to a massively outstanding degree. There are moments in the story that are a bit unevenly paced\, and there is an entire class of reskinned mini bosses\, but the sum of all the parts that are masterfully crafted make this a cinematic\, polished\, experience that is as close to perfect that PS4 games have gotten this generation.… Expand"

The main difference now is that the camera stays closer to Kratos body\, Atreus is a great addition to the gameplay. If you are surrounded by enemies\, you can call Atreus to launch stunning arrows in the enemies. So you can have a chance to hit them and regain your domain in the fight.PACEThe pacing of the game is perfect. And I really mean this. The choice to have no cuts when changing from gameplay to cutscene creates a great sense of continuity.PERFORMANCESChristopher Judge creates the ideal Kratos for this story. He loves his son\, but doesn't know how to get closer to him. Sunny Suljic is the son who needs and wants a father. He also confronts a reality that Kratos doesn't want to tell him\, that's the wall that keeps them both distant.SOUNDTRACKBear McCreary's soundtrack is majestic. The vocal choir that composes the soundtrack brings a sense of grander to the story and adds to the scope of the game.God Of War is a worthy sequel to it's predecessors and a fresh start for the GOW franchise. That leaves the door open for future sequels.… Expand"

80463,GOW2018,2020-07-06,10,"This released at an unfortunate time. As my GCSEs were coming up and so I didn't have time to play God of War if I wanted to do well in them. So I waited\, and when the time came\, it was glorious.The music felt like a perfect mix of Norse and God of War\, chilling and awe-inspiring. Then moments filled with passion and fury and triumph\, it truly enhanced the experience to great heights. The animations were filled with flavour and substance\, each hit was satisfying and the aesthetic of the world was appropriate and beautiful\, graphics as crisp as in God of War are rare and it made the gaming experience into a cinematic one on many occasions. Despite the quality of the animations\, they did get somewhat repetitive towards with end\, especially with the finishers. A few more in the sequel would keep the game looking refreshing in that department.Playing as Kratos has a high skill ceiling to truly play like A god of war\, but when you get the feel of the action\, it is addicting and gratifying\, the abilities you unlock diversify each battle encounter drastically and with the different enemies you can always experiment and find your style. Albeit\, as with the animation repetition\, the combat can but won't necessarily feel repetitive too. Atreus is more useful than other companions you have in games\, he provides access to areas unique to him and can hit those pesky targets that are a bit out of your reach\, as well as providing great combo potential with his animal skill. The boss fights are each unique and challenging\, but the Valkyrie fights are the game's toughest and most enjoyable\, it is pleasure in its truest and purest form when you conquer each of the Valkyries. Especially the name that I fear\, Sigrun. I've had more trouble with her than the souls borne bosses. Yes\, bosses like Isshin\, Manus\, Nameless King\, Midir\, Orphan and Ludwig felt easier than Sigrun on GMABE and GMAC. I don't know why. Albeit\, I haven't fought her in a while\, so maybe what I'm overrating her difficulty\, or I could also reaffirm my nightmares of her.I can't describe the greatness of the story and characters with this character limit. I'll share some brief thoughts. Kratos' development into a cold\, distant father makes sense given his history and justifies the distant relationship between him and Atreus at the beginning.God of war is a must-play masterpiece.… Expand"

Here he hasThis is a prime example how to revitalize a franchise. It is the best game in the God of War series\, maybe the best exclusive game on PS4 and will diffidently be in many top ten list. It was amazing what they did here. There was always the somehow valid critique that Kratos has become more of a stereotype character during the trilogy that was only defined by revenge and hatred. Here he has grown into a deep character. A man who wants to restart and bury his past (mistakes). His dynamic with his son Atreus is enjoyable and realistic. I always wanted to see more and was invested in the development of their relationship. Even more you see the unsaid emotions as Kratos is unfamiliar in his role as father and often struggles. You can also understand each characters motivations within the story and the character development is organic and believable. With Baldur\, Mimir\, the witch of the woods and the dwarfs you have a very strong task of support characters. The overall story is brilliant and engaging with some twist and reveals that will blow your mind. It shows also that you cant bury your past that easily. I must admit here that some obstacles feel a bit like stretching out the game but for me this is good because of the excellent gameplay. The gameplay and battle mechanics are also better than ever. Imagine that you take away the Chaos Blades and replace them with another weapon. This should create fallout and fans that should attack the developer. Instead you hear always praise for the Leviathan Axe and how good and creative it was implemented. This leads me to the game world and riddles. The graphics are so beautiful and the riddles are so interesting to figure out. The mechanics and riddles go hand in hand. Again saying the soundtrack is good is nearly unnecessary. It is a given fact for the franchise as there is no game with a bad soundtrack. They also add more RPG elements. You can improve your characters with better levels of armor\, learn abilities and create / improve armor pieces. Some have unique abilities that can also be levelled up. While you have not the range of totally switching Kratos\, what would be unfitting\, you can adapt to different styles. The battle system may seem limited to some but you have all tools to be awesome. There is also a game-world filled with things to discover and explore. It is a semi open world that unfolds as the story progresses. My only negative point are some of the boss battles. While there are again some breathtaking awesome encounters they recycle one type of boss too much. Overall the hype and praise is true. This game is excellent and you want to see more. It will get his place in gaming history and will be regarded as highlight of the PS 4.… Expand"

Parametros do jogo:- Lore/história: Muito boa. Após esgotar as possibilidades na mitologia grega\, Kratos migra ao norte e começa a se relacionar com a mitologia nórdica. Sendo esta muito popular e presente no dia a dia ocidental\, o que facilita a empatia e sentimento de familiaridade por parte do jogador. Trama com reviravoltas\, emoções fortes\, questionamentos filosóficos\, problemas que assolam a humanidade tanto num mundo fantasy de mitologia como hoje na vida real. Um jogador atento pode tirar muitos assuntos para se debater contemporamente extraindo do jogo.- Personagens: Muito bom. Todos os personagens principais são bem trabalhados e se não foram serão na continuação do mesmo. Vemos mudanças de comportamento face a novos fatos\, amadurecimento e reflexão dos personagens. Personagens profundos que nos atingem mesmo num mundo fantasy. Destaque para Kratos que começou a envelhecer e parece compreender que muitas ações explosivas que teve no passado geraram consequencias terríveis para si mesmo para as pessoas ao seu redor e tenta não seguir os mesmos passos.- Jogabilidade: muito boa. Passou de um \""hack and slash\"" puro para uma versão mista de RPG com hack and slash. Tal mistura foi bem executada e consegue trazer a complexidade de escolhas de UP de um RPG com a variabilidade de um hack and slash. Upgrade em relação ao GOW anteriores.- Gráficos: muito bons.

This game clearly goes for a blend of methodical combat like Dark Souls with more offensive focused pure hack and slash like the originals. That being said it does stumble in many areas of its combat.  The importance of positioning is lessened since you and enemies all has be this slight \""auto-positioning\"" feature attached to them thats glides you or the enemy to a position where the attack thrown can connect. Which leads to the game sometimes moving you towards on enemy you had no intentions of attacking first. The game has a very half assed rpg system\, its camera is too close for alot of the encounters it puts you in although the fact that the player can attack and move the camera can negate this issue in many cases\, its can still lead to some frustrating deaths. However\, the combat can force you into being far more thoughtful in your approach because of its camera as well. The main theme of the combat imo is efficiency. Whats the most efficient way to dispatch every enemy. Going into combat with this mindframe made me appreciate it so much more. Playing on hard difficulty really forcus you to think about each encounter. Yeah i can throw my axe from a safe distance over and over but thats slow\, tedious\, and not very on higher difficulties. I can go straight into an encounter mashing r1 or trying to be as cool as possible but thats an easy way to be hit from behind. Instead ill charge up axe r2\, freeze an enemy in place for a few seconds to immobilize him\, switch to blades to and pull his frozen body towards me. As hes frozen I position myself towards a cliff or wall then kick him to instantly pulverize him. I could use more examples but I'd be writing this all day. The point is the combat is more about defeating enemies in the most efficient way possible rather than looking cool or being a defensive shell the whole time.

More like an ending of a chapter than of a book. Still great but there were other battles in the game that were more memorable. So\, it needs to add different bosses\, different (or more) animations\, and a to polish the story a bit more. But you can tell there is so much left to tell\, saving it for the next installment.Over all\, even in 2020\, this is still one of the best PS4 games out there no doubt. You can't miss it.… Expand"

Сайд квестов немного\, но все они переплетаются тем или иным образом с основным сюжетом. Т.к. в игре есть много перемещений\, то на той же лодке спутник постоянно рассказывает каки-то истории\, из-за чего перемещения не утомляют.Из минусов хотелось бы отметить следующее:1. Не самое удачное решение с уровнем монстров. Если проходить игру на высокой или предельной сложности\, то враг старше тебя на 2 уровня становится непреодолимым препятствием\, как бы ты не старался\, т.к. урон по противнику существенно занижен\, а практически все его атаки ваншотят. Это приводит к бессмысленному бектрекингу\, если вы захотите исследовать игру полностью\, а вы захотите это сделать. :)2. Скриптовое преодоление препятствий. В игре нет возможности прыгать самостоятельно\, чтобы перепрыгнуть препятствие или залезть куда-то\, нужно подойти в строго определенную точку и нажать кнопку\, после этого Кратос совершит требуемое действие.3. Головоломки. Этот минус можно скорее отнести к плюсу\, т.к. головоломок всего 3-4 вида\, но реализованы они таким образом\, что до самого конца игрок не устанет их решать. 4. Боссы. Бои с боссами эпичны\, но сам процесс боя очень скриптованный и местами скучный. Внесюжетные боссы представляют из себя несколько вариаций одного босса.В итоге. Жду хотя бы какие-то новости о дате выхода второй части\, т.к. хочу увидеть продолжение и вновь вернуться на поля девяти миров.… Expand"

80641,GOW2018,2020-02-19,10,"Back when this game was announced during E3 2016 I neither knew what exactly God of War was nor who even Kratos was\, confusing me what was happening. When I first saw the gameplay shown during the presentation I absolutely loved what I was seeing. Whatsoever I got this game pretty late\, but it was still worth getting. The graphics are amazing\, I love the details\, e.g. leaving a track on the snow behind. The gameplay is very good\, I never got bored of it and could swinging the Leviathanaxe (and calling it back)  and *spoiler warning for the next sentences* the holy Blades of Chaos\, boy was that a reveal. The thing I loved the most was the plot. It's got so many twists\, like Baldur being the son of Freya (aka the Witch of the Woods) or the fact that Atreus is Loki. The dialogue written for this game is very well made\, I never got bored listening to Mimir's storys! Now the difficulty. As a simple casual gamer I played the easiest mode. But even the easiest mode holds the greatest challenge of the game: the Valkyries! Absolutely hard\, but doable. The hardest difficulty is like that Sony guy said \""for people who'd fight a polar bear in boxers\"".The lore is so good that even the shrines you found kept me interested and some side quests were absolutely epic. Let's come to boss fights: many times you'll fight a troll in different skins\, which is kinda bad\, HOWEVER if you get to the different bosses they're astounding! Fighting dragons\, the sons of thor and Baldur of the back on a dragon?! That's amazing! The only negative thing from the game in my eyes was the backtracking but it isn't that big of a problem unless you're a completionist. Talking of completionists 100% this game is very hard\, I gave up at some point. Still a nice challenge.*I'd also love to mention that the characters in this game are very well written and never feel off. Voice acting is on point\, and I LOVE Christopher Judge as Kratos. There's so many things I'd love to talk about but I gotta keep this review \""short\"".

But\, it's not a game that I ever got completely absorbed by (aside for some brief sequences scattered throughout).

To start off\, althoughFirst and foremost God of War is a very impressive game to look at and to marvel its technical prowess. But\, it's not a game that I ever got completely absorbed by (aside for some brief sequences scattered throughout). The general high praise for it is certainly valid and I am in agreement on the qualities which have given the game its numerous awards and popularity. To start off\, although this review is 2 years late\, the graphics are still much better than those of most games today\, if not all but a few. The visuals are beautiful\, the way the game moves and feels has pushed the boundaries for games— at the time it came out I probably couldn't name a game that looked and felt more technically polished on a surface level. At first I wasn't much of a fan of the combat as it felt kind of sluggish and monotonous with the introductory enemy encounters\, but with more playtime I started to really enjoy and appreciate the level of detail put into fighting as Kratos. What at first seemed a combat design too heavy and slow soon became satisfyingly precise and nuanced-- you can feel the weight and power of Kratos’ axe\, which starts feeling great and controlled with repetition\, getting practice with all of the movement and timing of Kratos' abilities and whatnot. So the game really gains momentum because of this expanding comfortability with and fun of fighting. The combat is not perfect by any means\, however. It can become a little too repetitive with the common enemies that Kratos' faces\, but never to the point of annoyance due to how fun it can be to fight any one large group of mythical creatures.What was somewhat lacking in the game for me was actually the pace of the whole thing. The story with its Norse mythological ties was interesting and well-implemented into the world for the most part. I enjoyed hearing your talking head of a companion Mímir relate his ties to the Norse gods and mythology. Though the main thread of the game story was a bit weak\, or just felt slightly underwhelming in terms of how it carried the game forward. There are many brief intervals of dullness in the game. I'd be uncertain whether to explore some of the outer areas of the world or just continue with the main story. The game's somewhat passive suggestions to explore the realms and go on side quests conflicted with the main story. So this seemed to take away from the immersion into Kratos and Atreus’ personal quest at hand. Why should we go to that place? Just to play a mini game or trial that has no consequence to the story. Albeit these side quests and challenges are generally fun and in that sense they are positive aspects of the game--the Valkyrie fights were one of the highlights of the game. But usually\, the optional quests seemed like extra material to stuff in to the game to ensure more playability. More linearity would be good in this case\, at least in terms of the player's objective. If more of the exploration were connected with Kratos' and Atreus' journey instead of being optional and seemingly inconsequential\, then the game would have been more powerful.To conclude this rambling\, I definitely want to make clear that God of War is a damn good game. Great in visuals\, combat\, sound\, attention to detail and atmosphere. It does fantastically in bringing Norse mythology to life\, often informative and relevant to anyone interested in the ancient lore. I have only played parts of the earlier God War installments\, but it doesn't surprise me that this is labeled as the best yet. It is no joke of a game experience. However\, it needed more narrative immersion\, less of the in-between an open world and cinematic action-adventure\, and a stronger conclusion for it to be considered one of the greats of the generation. Though it's still a game that every gamer should definitely try for how fun and seamless the gameplay is and to note the great care and detail put into the surrounding world and lore\, even if all the parts don’t come together most effectively.… Expand"

I know it was a story decision\, but I think the developers messed up a bit in this regard. The game actually felt like GOW again when you finally pull out the twin blades.Graphically it's beautiful of course. Sound design great. Moves feel weighty. The skill trees are good. Mechanically it's very nice. But most of the \""puzzles\"" to obtain chests felt like padding and didn't add anything to the game. And where were the boss battles??

While these moments are either completely scripted or simply have you press one button while Kratos does the rest by himself\, there is absolutely no denying that some insane effort went into those cutscenes and they are among the most impressive things I have ever seen in a videogame.The parts inbetween though\, the actual gameplay? Repetetive and boring. Puzzles are ridiculously easy\, there's no sense of accomplishment to them. Constant boss recycling and a combat system that works great against a single target\, but feels pretty unsatisfying against enemy groups. And since fighting groups is all you do for 95% of the time.. well\, you get the point.My biggest issue however is the story pacing. What at first feels like the beginning of a grand adventure loses itself in one glorified fetch quest after another only a few hours in. What follows then is the dire realization of how much potential was wasted here\, as God of War completely fails to build up on its initial premise and basically finishes with almost the exact same stakes it had begun. There are some heartfelt and great moments between Kratos and Atreus\, but overall the story is just so underwhelming.And that's ultimately how I'd the describe the whole experience\, underwhelming.

I've seen a couple of reviewers say that this game is superior to Red Dead Redemption 2 - that is\, without a doubt\, the most preposterous thing I've ever read in a video game review. If you see a reviewer make that claim\, do not ever rely on their judgment again.So here's God of War for the PS4 in a nutshell: Gears of War minus guns and squad replaced with ten year old boy. You are on-rails - make no mistake...this is not an open world game. That\, right there\, basically renders this game inferior to RDR2\, or even Far Cry 5. Also\, while the environment looks alright\, you don't really get much of a chance to explore it. Your basically thrown into a barrage of enemies right from the start. Not too long into the start of the game\, your thrown into what I would consider a rather epic boss battle. So while I haven't beaten the game yet\, from what I've experienced thus far\, you basically never have a \""cooling off\"" period where you get the chance to interact with other characters and build your character RPG style. Like I said\, this is basically medieval Gears of War. It is\, in essence\, an on-rails beat-em-up.This is a $15.00 game. This is not the best game of all time\, and it completely pales in comparison to RDR2. It's not even in the same league. I have never played a game where my experience differed so wildly from professional reviewers. Even the infamous Fallout 4 review deviation wasn't as extreme as this.

En primer momento no me gustó tanto el sistema de combate\, pero crece en ti y se vuelve adictivo\, terminas muy enganchado. El sistema de armas/armaduras/talismanesLa siguiente reseña fue publicada orignalmente en 3Djuegos:Épico. Tal cual.Los rumores son verdad: el juego es perfecto. No hay reseña qué escribir... pero lo haré de igual forma.JUGABILIDAD:Muy buena y muy adictiva. En primer momento no me gustó tanto el sistema de combate\, pero crece en ti y se vuelve adictivo\, terminas muy enganchado. El sistema de armas/armaduras/talismanes y demás se siente bastante actual y le da un buen tinte el decidir qué potenciar. Además no es solo que cada pieza tenga su nivel: las piezas de las piezas tienen sus niveles para desarrollar\, y eso le da una complejidad muy buena al personaje.Debo decir que comúnmente no me gustan los NPC que me acompañan en las aventuras\, ya que los considero más un lastre que otra cosa\, pero Atreus es mi excepción. Debe ser uno de mis NPC favoritos en mucho tiempo y su desarrollo y progresión es uno de los mejores que he experimentado.La historia\, las cinemáticas\, la narrativa\, las misiones extra y los enemigos. Todo vale cada segundo.En particular las cinemáticas y la narrativa son destacables\, es impresionante que un videojuego tenga mejor fotografía que los nominados el Oscar de éste año. No\, no exagero.GRÁFICOS:El estilo gráfico y el nivel visual del juego son superiores. Son inigualables. Santa Monica quiso demostrar que la espera había valido la pena\, así como anticiparnos que la espera para el próximo lo valdrá también.SONIDO:Épico. Todo el soundtrack es... bueno\, ya lo dije.INNOVACIÓN:Probablemente el apartado más débil del juego y pese a eso no le hizo mella a la experiencia. Que Kratos no tenga un nivel propiamente dicho como lo conocemos\, y que éste dependa no de la XP ganada sino de las combinaciones de equipo que puede usar ha hecho del gameplay algo mucho más balanceado que lo que podemos encontrar en otros juegos de acción.… Expand"

80796,GOW2018,2020-01-20,8,"This is a modern good looking action game with a very good Story. Kratos and his Son will go on a beatiful Journey together to find Peace for their beloved Mother and Wife\, On the way there they will learn a lot about the world\, the culture and about themselves.StoryVery well written\, it lost me for a few moments\, cause I didnt connect to the Son when he got to know that he is a god\, but besides that it was brutally good. Very well voice acted and Kratos is just a very good Character.Atmosphere/GraphicsIt looks stunning\, some rare drops in performance and some weird looking HDR\, but all in all a beatiful Game. For me the Nordic Mythology is very interesting and it was a little bit sad that they didnt got deeper into the Lore. The worlds could have been more meaningful and also bigger. Two of them are just for an Activity in the Game (Arena).The creatures and gods/godesses are very nice chosen and looking phenomenal. But I wanted more of it\, like I said I love the Mythology and I know its more about the Path of both characters\, but for me a little bit more around it would be better\, especially in the lots of minibosses (they are all the same only in different colours).GameplayThe Fighting and abilities are so good. It was so much Fun to fight and combo the many possibilites that you have\, also Atreus is very helpful. I hate the Leveling system\, it wasnt fun at all and the metroidvania aspect didnt catched me.So Gameplay was for me the most difference in Qualitiy.SummarySo you have to play this Game its really stunning but it comes with some flaws\, which they can easily get rid of in a second part. 8/10… Expand"

So much thought\, attention to detail\, and passion went into this game from the visuals\, music\, gameplay\, story and so much more making it one of the most amazing experiences ever.It goes without saying that the visuals are absolutely stunning\, and the music is epic\, but what I loved most is the story and gameplay.  The story just compels you to keep going and delve deeper into this Norse realm that Kratos finds himself in\, and the title is just steeped in Norse mythology.  The dynamics between Kratos and the other characters is just so much fun to watch especially watching the relationship between Kratos and Atreus unfold: I’ve never felt so connected and invested into characters as much as these two except for maybe Ellie and Joel in The Last of Us .  Where the game truly shines\, however\, is the gameplay.  As you explore the world of Midgard\, you’ll often find yourself locked in battle with multiple foes.  Just like the older titles in the series\, you’ll utilize combos\, runic attacks\, and Atreus to brutally dispatch your enemies\, and it feels so good.While the crafting system is good and offers a sense of character progression\, there is just one minor flaw with it.  You can collect crating materials to make and upgrade armor and weapons\, but the problem is how inconsistent finding materials needed to craft items feel.  There might be this piece of armor that you want to craft or upgrade\, but the materials needed to craft it will come much later in the game\, and you’ll have crafted something far better by the time you get that material.  It feels off and messes with the progression a little bit\, but nothing that affects the rest of the game.God of War is\, simply put\, a masterpiece of this generation\, and one of the best games of all time.  It really set the bar incredibly high for single-player experiences\, so game developers will have some big shoes to fill and will be incredibly hard to match.  I will be thinking about this game for a long time to come\, and I honestly can’t wait to come back to Kratos\, Atreus\, and the world of Midgard in the inevitable sequel.… Expand"

So when I started playing this game I was overwhelmed as it is easy to for some first timers to the series. You have combat that is somewhat demanding as you have to account for who you are fighting\, how many enemies there are\, knowing where they are\, what are their weaknesses\, paying attention to your health\, etc. i.e. in my instance fighting 2 trolls while other enemies attack you as well. I am simply not used to doing all of that and the difficulty I played on was Balanced which is a very reasonable difficulty level for first timers. Another reason why this game was overwhelming to me was because the amount of skills\, weapons\, armor\, to choose from/upgrade. I do not like it when a game offers you a lot of skills to choose from because it is a lot to remember during combat. It's like how AC Odyssey worked. You had a bunch of skills to choose from but you could only execute 4 of them. Except in this game you could use all of them\, but I didn't really care to learn all of them even though I invested a lot in skills. I mainly stuck with my Runic skills. I like certain things simple when it comes to games. As far as upgrading gear I did not like the fact that certain attributes would fluctuate. For instance if I were to invest my hacksilver into upgrading my chest piece and depending on what chest piece you get your cooldown attribute could increase while your strength attribute decreases or your runic attribute could increase while your defense decreases\, etc. Your attributes are: Strength\, Runic\, Defense\, Vitality\, Luck\, and Cooldown. These attributes strength level will fluctuate throughout the game as you upgrade your gear and is kind of frustrating but you have to pay attention to what you absolutely want to increase which means sacrificing another attribute. Putting all of that aside the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos are really cool weapons. The Blades of Chaos was my favorite and Rage Mode is really cool. Oh\, and Brok and Sindri are funny characters (Brok was my favorite as he would say the most off the wall things). I never did any side missions for them though. Side note: The flying elves were my toughest opponent and always died the most when facing them. Hate those dam elves!Overall I did like this game\, but would ABSOLUTELY NOT play it on any other difficulty than balanced. As I was going through the story I couldn't help but think that Kratos and his son were doing all of this just to get to a dam mountain and release the mother's ashes. But\, I went along with it and along the way there were some really cool moments and a lot of AWWWW **** HERE WE GO AGAIN! moments too. The developers of the game did a great job\, but this will probably be the first and last GoW game I will ever play.… Expand"

The game looks and sounds great with monsters making disturbing noises and epic moments drowned out by loud ominous music make every scene even more unforgettable. Kratos and Atreus both grow and learn on their journey. Its a story filled with lore around every corner and a perfectly crafted version of Norse mythology. The journey our characters take really shows off all the great relationships this game has. It has a great father and son dynamic with Kratos constantly scolding his son and teaching him to learn from mistakes of others including Kratos himself. It works really well and the side characters are entertaining and lovable and the villain is probably the best part. The game play is also great hack and slash fun with a lot of diversity and different ways to approach your enemy's. Its all well done and even the RPG like upgrading system works even if it gets grindy post main story.The combat never felt old because your constantly learning and obtaining new things and travelling to different places with new enemy's. The side missions are also great fun and exploration is rewarded and a welcome feature. Occasionally the games pacing can be slowed down with some boring tasks and things to do but its very rare.

80943,GOW2018,2018-11-15,9,"Tras años después de God of War 3 nos traen una nueva entrega. En este juego encontramos notables diferencias respecto a lo tradicional en la saga. Tiene notables características de RPG ya que contamos con diferentes tipos de ataques y habilidades\, sistema de niveles y equipo con diferentes mejoras tanto para la vida como resistencia y daño. Procedo a analizar punto por punto.Jugabilidad.En este sentido sigue siendo de acción con diferentes combinaciones de ataques y habilidades como pasaba en anteriores entregas. No obstante se ha vuelto más táctico y a perdido parte del ¨frenetismo¨ que encontrábamos anteriormente. Ahora\, los controles de ataque se asemejan a un Dark Souls en consola ya que los botones de ataque están en R1 y R2 mientras que L1 y L2 se emplean para el uso del escudo y otras acciones. Este control produce una agradable sensación al jugar y la combinación de los ataques se hace de una forma más ligera ya que no consiste en machacar botones uno tras otro.Árbol de habilidades.En el apartado de habilidades tenemos un gran cuadro que podemos desarrollar a partir de nuestra forma de juego. De tal forma que si usamos más el escudo podemos desarrollar su uso o\, si por el contrario\, usamos más el hacha\, podemos mejorarla.Guión y desarrollo.Se trata de una historia no convencional en la saga ya que en vez de de tener que ir en busca de tal o cual Dios para matarlo\, se trata de un viaje de superación y aprendizaje para Kratos y Atreus a través de los diferentes reinos de la mitología Nórdica. Hay una evolución a lo largo de la trama de los personajes en su forma de ver el mundo así como en su pensamiento que está bastante bien construida. No obstante se pierde un poco esa sensación de progreso ¨personal¨ de los personajes si te dedicas a la exploración del vasto mundo que tenemos a nuestra disposición. A lo largo de la aventura iremos interaccionando con diferentes mundos y razas. Tiene una muy buena ambientación pero flojea en el diseño de niveles. Ya que algunos de los mundos se pueden considerar amplios pasillos con pocas cosas que hacer en ellos.El juego cuenta también con un excelente apartado gráfico y sonoro  que nos ayudará a meternos de lleno en el mundo que nos presenta. Los enemigos están  zonas con sentido dentro de la narrativa ya que un tipo de enemigo aparece en un determinado lugar porque en ese sitio hay unas características que hacen que abunde ese tipo de enemigo.Como puntos negativo:La poca diversidad de enemigos ya que es técnicamente la misma.Algún pequeño bug visual\, nada que afecte a la jugabilidad.El diseño de niveles en determinados puntos.Como puntos positivos:La historia y desarollo.La calidad gráfica.Misiones secundarias.Explicación de la mitología Nórdica mediante diálogos y coleccionables.Enemigos secundarios\, Las Valquirias.Nuevo sistema de combate y habilidades.… Expand"

Your main objective is to lay the ashes of Atreus’ mother on the highest peak of all the realms\, and the entire story intertwines from there. The story is brilliant in many ways\, throwing setbacks every step of the way. One of the brilliant aspects of this game’s story is how its paced\, and each new adventure doesn’t feel placed at the last moment. The conflict between Kratos\, a man who still struggles to get a grasp on his bloody\, god-slaying past\, and Atreus\, his son\, who he constantly refers to as ‘boy’\, constantly getting the tiniest flaws pointed out by his father is extremely well-written\, and feels real. Along the way\, you fight all that Norse mythology can throw at you and the combat\, unlike other games that put their story front-and-centre\, is extremely well made. The game moved away from the previous iteration’s combat\, which was merely focused on mindless 700-hit-combos\, to a third-person one\, a truly important decision. The Leviathan Axe is a powerful tool\, with runes and skill trees also adding depth to the combat. Atreus\, in terms of combat\, was utilised much better than I thought he would be. Unlike other games in which your companion just loves jumping to the nearest enemy and then shouting for help\, Atreus constantly assists you. Even one arrow from him\, just by pressing Square\, can double the length of a combo\, as it staggers enemies for just the right amount of time\, and he can be your saviour against certain enemies. The game also looks incredible. I’m still questioning how hardware from 2013 could run this. There is never a bad texture in sight\, and while there are a couple clipping issues with the snow sometimes\, almost all of it is fine. I’ve never been wowed so many times due to the sheer beauty of a location\, as I have in God of War. The soundtrack is\, while slightly forgettable compared to what’s elsewhere\, well incorporated into the game itself\, and the masculine main theme\, goes down as one of the best video-game scores of 2018. The freedom is also something I didn’t expect. Especially on the boat\, you have a lot to explore. Atreus even nags about this when you’re on a boat. There are so many tasks to do\, that it extents the playtime of the already-lengthy campaign. A masterpiece that entertains\, saddens and shocks from beginning to end. A must-play even for someone who doesn’t enjoy a story in a video game. And a must-play for everyone else. One of the pinnacles of this generation\, and my favourite game of all time.… Expand"

It’s been a long time since I had this feeling with a game\, a game that I can not stop playing and get the urge to calling in sick at work just to play a fantastic game. I played God of War for two weeks intensely\, got the platinum for it and loved every single minute of doing so. I dreamed of it when I was asleep\, thought about it when at work and when I played it I didn’t want it to end.The journey of Kratos and Atreus is one you do not want to miss out on\, the game alone is worth getting a Playstation 4 for. Two things I need to point out that I was afraid would take a hit for the worse on this game compared to the rest of the series and that’s the voice acting and ability to jump. Initially I did miss being able to jump but it doesn’t take long until you get familiar with how this new God of War gameplay is\, which is in all honestly still very action packed with a lot of combos\, just not as many tricks and depth to it as before but I still think they did a good job as I was very negative to that fact before I started playing the game. Then the voice acting\, wow just wow. The new Kratos is way better than the old one\, and I thought he was good too! Mimir\, Atreus and all the others got a spot on casting too and it makes the whole game have a complete package\, great voice acting adds oh so much to a game. Just listening to Mimir and Atreus storytelling when being on the boat brought me great joy for example\, I can’t remember last time I could just enjoy looking around in a game taking in the environment and listening to characters talk.So what are you waiting for? If you got a Playstation 4 there is no reason you shouldn’t be all over this game by now.

Atreus\, un personnage non joueur autonome devient de plus en plus sûr de lui et il est utile à la dynamique. C’est une autre de leur innovation.

Nothing inside the game breaks the immersion. We are actively involved in this \""Shakespearean\"" family drama where the gods are bastards. We play Kratos\, who has aged since those epic adventures in Greece. We are participating in the evolution of the relationship with his son Atreus who are getting to know each other better through their journey to the highest mountain in the mythological realms to spread the ashes of his mother who has just passed away. A non-autonomous player character becomes more and more self-confident and is useful for dynamics. This is another of their innovations. At some point\, Atreus gets arrogant and really does something crazy. This affects the gameplay in an unexpected way since we have learned to work in a team with it. The game makes us live moments rich in emotion that surprised me with their intensity. Never seen before with a video game!

The only irritating thing about the puzzles were sometimes you had to spend a lot of time looking for things.  I like the open world design of the game\, but I wish there was more incentive to explore the world.  The different loot you get didn't feel that special to me and also the side quests just seemed like busy work.  That said\, I really enjoyed exploring the world and doing the non story part of the game.  Another thing that felt was missing was the lack of other characters in the game besides spirits\, valkryies\, etc.  The world felt a bit empty.  Hopefully\, they populate the future games with more characters.  Perhaps\, they were just trying to get the structure up with this game.  The production values are probably the best part of this game.  The graphics and atmosphere are phenomenal.

I am 40 years old and I ve been playing video games for nearly 30 years now. There is very little to surprise me in the games now and very few game \""wows\"" me... I have seen nearly every kind of story twits\, every kind of gameplay mechanic etc. So when you read this short review please bear in mind that I will be as objective and unbiased as I can be.Why do you play a game Like God of War? For its story? For its Action? Visuals maybe?MY first drive in a god of war game is the story mixed with the mythology.1 - The Journey! (Story) The norse mythology combined with Kratos' story is a perfect ground. And the game teaches you that it is not the \""end\"" of the adventure but the \""journey\"".I will be honest with you. Of course if you know the Norse mythology\, the ending has a good twist. But in my humble opinion\, many of the side quests had \""better\"" stories than the main story. (Fafnir storyline for example)   But during the Journey (I dont want to call it an adventure... it is a journey) everything pulls you to itself to uncover\, to reveal the truth. In a very long time this is one of the games that I have completed with nearly every side missions. (Left only a few chests and valkyries).The story with his kid had bored me. I expected someting like Joel and Ellie kind of stuff (Last of us). But it is not as good or emotional as the mentioned game.  Kratos' calling his son \""Booooii!\"" constantly annoyed me to hell.The environmental puzzles and platforming are quite enough and with some clever clue system you always feel that you are accomplisihing something.2- The action : When the combat system changed from regular God of War combat to 3Rd person combat God of war and the lack of new weapons\, I tought that the combat will be stale or not as colorful as the previous installions.Thank god that I was wrong! The combat with the Axe and the shield is VERY satisfiying with various upgrades and play mechanics. Plus\, the Itemization and inventory / item management have changed the game drastically!If you like to play safe\, you can stack on “life” upgrades and depending armor sets to survive longer. Or If you are like me\, who thinks “best defense is the offense!” then you can stack up power and other aggresive moves\, so that you can easily\, dispatch foes with ultimate combos and devastating frost attacks.3 - The technical side. Sound- Music-Graphics\, environements\, \, are detailed\, top notch\, great\, even on some occasions “perfect”. Lighting\, sounds\, voice acting. All great and they keep the atmosphere over the top.Please do not compare this game with older installations.  The older games (except ascension) are masterpieces in their own terms and a genre defining games. But This is the God of War.More Mature\, More Father\,More Monster…The long and short of it… The new “God of War” is not a gamet hat you can understand from a review or something that explainable\, but a journey that you must live for yourself.Thank you for reading.… Expand"

Игра прогрессирует\, и я этому рад. Взяв только позитивный опыт souls-like игр с их перекатами и таймингами\, разработчики выдали одну из самых лучших боевок со времён Royal Guard в DMC3. Возвраты топора это вообще бомба\, очень сильный упор сделан на комбинации\, комх в игре можно придумать великое множество и они не прописаны по типу трёх квадратов в мортал комбат. Разочаровало лишь их однообразное исполнение (но ни в коем случае не разнообразие\, т.к. они достаточно свободные и при наличии небольшой толики воображения можно создавать комбо длиною в вечность не повторяя движений) — все комбо основаны на одной кнопке и выполняются с чередованием пауз. Ветви прокачки этих навыков радуют — можно использовать всего понемногу\, можно драться одними кулаками со щитом. Порадовали рунические атаки — можно одеть достаточно сильного \""магического\"" Кратоса с упором в рунические статы. В общем\, простор для билдов огромный.Отлично проработана логика школьника Атрея — в зависимости от костюма двигается соответственно боевому стилю. Нельзя недооценивать его умения\, ибо он невероятно силён при каче его лука. Его ИИ вообще пушка\, в бою не мешает\, а если кооперироваться с ним и играть от его захватов — можно проводить виртуозные драки с использованием оглушения.Не улыбнула сюжетная линия\, как только я вошёл во вкус\, она сразу же закончилась. Для меня это было каким-то ударом\, что-ли. Гринда экипировки абсолютно нет — можно пройти игру на повышенной сложности с бомжовым ансет шмотом забивая на прлсьбы гномов и доп. квесты.У игры нет какого-то линейного прохождения\, по пути ты часто встречаешь задания которые можешь и не выполнить из-за перевеса в уровне противника. Не понятно\, как разрабы видели прохождение игры\, в связи с этим у меня осталось негативное впечатление от сюжетки — игру прошёл\, а мир так и не посмотрел. Благо потом остались валькирии\, Муспкльхейм и Нифльхейм — там можно ещё долго тусоваться после завершения основной сюжетной линии\, но как-то странно всё это.

Si bien el Hack & Slash es uno de mis géneros favoritos\, no he sentido que el cambio de este género en la nueva entrega haya sido algo que te impida disfrutar la experiencia de God Of War que ahora parece una mezcla de acción y aventura con razgos de los RPG ya sea en el arbol de habilidades o en la capacidad de poder mejorar o elaborar nuevos trajes para poder tener mejoras en los aspectos que busquemos mejorar para mantener un equilibrio en nuestro estilo de juego lo cual hace que el gameplay pueda variar si eres capaz de poder explotar al máximo el gameplay que el juego te puede ofrecer. Si logras persevir al niño como un estorbo\, esto no es así ya que puedes utilizar al niño como un arma más y poder realizar mejores combos.En el aspecto del apartado gráfico\, sin duda es excepcional el cómo Santa Mónica ha podido explotar el hardware del PS4 (2013) y cómo han utilizado las mejoras de PS4 Pro. Sin duda me he quedado boquiabierto con los escenarios\, los modelados de los personajes principales y secundarios\, las armaduras y los objetos que nos vayamos encontrando en el entorno. Personalmente\, no he percibido algún tipo de tirón o caída de framerate que haya arruinado mi experiencia de juego\, he sentido una fluidez sólida tanto en el gameplay como en las cinemáticas (que no se sienten como tal) Las cinemáticas de este God Of War deben ser una de las mejor implementadas en los videojuegos. No sientes que estuvieras en una cinemática\, sino como si fuera parte del juego y sin duda es algo que logra mejorar mucho la inmersión\, esto conocido como un plano secuenciaEn el apartado sonoro\, sin duda se han mantenido a la altura del soundtrack de anteriores entregas\, es lo que siempre me transmite magia y epicidad sintiendome como si fuera la primera vez que jugué God Of War en PS2. Les recomiendo escuchar el tema principal (Overture) con subtitulo en español y vean el cómo este tema refleja todo lo que pasamos en la aventura.La historia es de lo más brutal que he visto en un juego de God Of War\, este es el fuerte de la entrega ya que comparado con anteriores títulos es superior en este apartado. El comienzo de la aventura ya nos vaticina el tono que tendrá la historia con un Kratos más maduro y posicionado (Actúa acorde a qué amerite la situación). Comenzamos con lo que de por sí es nuestro objetivo final el cual es cumplir el último deseo de Faye (Madre de Atreus y esposa de Kratos) que es llevar sus cenizas al pico más alto de los 9 reinos que vi bien en la premisa suena algo simple\, en el desarrollo del juego se llega a profundizar en varios aspectos en la relación padre e hijo\, y en lo bien escrito que están los personajes y lo sobresaliente del guión. (Todo lo que diré de la historia para no spoilear)Esta es la clase de juego que uno debe adquirir\, sin micropagos ni microtransacciones. New Game + gratis\, contenido adicional en misiones secundarias\, rescate de dragones\, busqueda de objetos para los enanos y lo más brutal que son las valkyrias que son todo un reto en la máxima dificultad en especial la última.Gran variedad en los mundos y 2 extras en las que podremos encontrar grande recompensas al terminarlos. Uno es un laberinto que cambia constantemente mediante avancemos y si morimos perderemos todo lo obtenido y otro en el que se nos presenta arena de enemigos con diferentes formas especificas en las que nos piden acabar con ellos.En conclusión: Para mí\, es el mejor juego de la historia. Cuida cada uno de sus apartados y para buscarle pegas hay que ser exquisitos. Quizás la variedad de enemigos\, pero es algo ya como dije de exquisitos. Lo de no soltar a muchos Dioses es entendible ya que esta entrega va a tener una secuela. Un juego que es arte y que enamora.… Expand"

Sometimes the game is punishing as hell.During the first boss battle I was so overwhelmed for what to come\, but only the Valkyries met the conditions (by far). The game doesn't actually has boss battles\, only \""preludes\"" for enemies you will face afterwards.The semi-NPC works really well and feels (actually it is) part of the battle.Finally\, the graphics are phenomenal.

Where the series used to be a sort of DMC-lite\, known for boss fights and stunning brutality\, the 2018 game still has these strengths while being way more fleshed out and a more well rounded experience.The majority of the gameplay consists of exploration\, combat\, and puzzle solving\, and each of these elements is very well done. There are interesting puzzles that make use of a variety of mechanics\, though many of them are needed only for optional content. The level design is excellent\, with beautiful and interesting environments with clever concepts\, and the way the world interconnects is reminiscent of the original Dark Souls. Careful exploration and paying attention to your environment is rewarded with a variety of things to find throughout the world. The combat has also borrowed from Dark Souls\, now being a kind of hybrid between it and DMC. There are still a variety of combos and attacks at your disposal\, but with the addition of axe throwing\, a dodge roll\, the block/parry system\, and the need to watch enemy animations to predict their moves\, you end up with the best of both worlds\, and at times the sheer number of tactics you have available to you can be overwhelming. Enemy variety is a little underwhelming\, the camera can be frustrating\, and on the higher difficulties the enemies can be too spongy to feel realistic\, but overall combat is excellent. The addition of these elements between the cinematic moments and boss fights make the truly epic moments all the more memorable and awesome. A good bit of the side content is found along the way of the main story\, but I would estimate that the main storyline is about 20-25 hours long\, and a 100% playthrough with full exploration takes roughly 50-60 hours\, depending on your difficulty selection. The game does have post game content.Surprisingly\, the story in God of War is actually really well done\, simple but well executed. The narrative revolves around the relationship between Kratos and his son\, Atreus\, and there are some really touching moments throughout the game as their relationship evolves and both characters grow. The story isn't laden down with unnecessary padding\, and is very well handled.The gameplay and narrative are what makes God of War great\, but the technical aspects are where it innovates and what pushes it beyond the average Action RPG. Once the game opens\, there are NO loading screens\, and the camera cuts away only when you pause to open the menu. Cutscenes\, cinematics\, and gameplay are all seamlessly woven into one\, making the game uniquely full of substance while feeling cinematic\, as though you were playing a superhero movie. Graphics and sound design are similarly top of the line\, especially on the PS4 Pro\, but by no means is a Pro necessary to have the game run well and look beautiful.Flaws in the game past those noted in the combat section include a strange choice of final boss that many (including myself) thought underwhelming\, a somewhat counter-intuitive and cluttered menu screen\, and RPG mechanics that seem tacked-on and not as well polished as the rest of the game. I'd say most would agree that the game would have been better off without the RPG mechanics and a ton of different items\, with exploration that rewarded upgrades directly. Also\, due to the unification of narrative and gameplay as one whole\, replay value is somewhat limited\, but the game was long enough that I'd call that a minor concern.Though the game has flaws like any other\, these flaws are absolutely overwhelmed by the quality and polish of the entirety of the rest of the game. God of War 2018 is a rare modern masterpiece\, a true 10/10. Dark Souls may have been unseated as my favorite game of all time.… Expand"

Put the disc back into the box which now resides in a pile destined for Gamestop. The graphics and presentation are top notch to be sure and the action is decent\, but the game is just boring to me. There are much better 3rd person action games out there right now like Sekiro\, Dark Souls\, Nioh\, Etc. that just offer far more in the game-play department.While the environments look great\, there is not any sense of exploration or vastness. Everything feels like your walking down a corridor and there is usually only one way to go. Therefore\, the action needs to be the most interesting element\, yet it's just a few combos and a couple new moves you can learn. Some of the moves are actually exactly the same\, involving a power that blasts enemies out of the way. There are literally like 4 of these moves to unlock that do the same damn thing.  Then the game bogs you down with some unnecessarily complex rpg elements which barely affect anything until the end game. The story is really not even that interesting to tell you the truth. The Last of Us\, but with a God and his son\, LOL. Game gets a decent score for polish and production values\, and the first fight which is basically the highlight of the game. It quickly spirals down a well after the first 15 minutes. When the best part of the game occurs literally 5 minutes after the game starts\, you've got some problems.The game can even get infuriating with completely cheap bosses who need like a hundred perfect combos to kill. Just dodge\, combo\, dodge\, combo. Honestly\, it's lazy game design on full display. A good action game better keep the action interesting. Also\, the enemies are all the same. Fight a troll\, then fight a huge rock thing with nearly the same move-set\, and then fight Another troll\, but it's red this time. LOL.  You have to change up the action by introducing new unique enemies and weapons to use in a game like this.  Devil May Cry series is one that gets this right. Just as a new weapon has run it's course and starts getting boring\, you find something that unlocks a whole new move-set to master. Bloodborne anyone?I don't know\, I just need more. There is nothing fun to find and exploration is basically go down this obvious side corridor and find a chest. There are a couple puzzles requiring throwing the axe which are well thought out.  For me the Sony exclusives are behind the curve when it comes to designing fun games. These games are serviceable\, but get boring very quickly. You literally beat this game by going Dodge\, L1\, L1\, L1\, L2\, lol. Once in a while you can throw the axe\, which is cool\, but does not save it for me.I'm out\, and honestly I'm gonna be quite wary about Sony games after being burned by GOW\, Spiderman\, and Horizon.

In Most games you see a character with lacking  abilities\, and then you see them move on and grow more and develop in a classic way. Since I see this a lot in video games it doesn't seem interesting for a character to have this development. Now you go and play God of War\, you just entered the big boy region. Atreus has a development were he goes to being useless to being skilled but not perfect. But then you got the twist. He goes to being overconfident when he realizes he's half god.

Now\, speaking about GoW\, it's still one of the best games of 2018\, but that's 'cause of the Industry mediocre level and Santa Monica is usually two steps above the normal studios. We're still far away from games like The Witcher III or The Last of Us but the impression is that Santa Monica chose the easy way and just followed the trend while being careful to keep the soul of the series intact. Now about the positive things\, they made an impressive job on the storytelling and the cinematics. Those flowing camera movements are perfect and going from cutscenes to real gameplay is always smooth. I also love the music\, so rhythmically intense during fight and soft during more relaxed moments. The graphic is gorgeous on the PS4 Pro altough the level design could have been a lot better\, considering the interesting setting. Combat is pretty solid although nothing innovative. It's still very enjoyable but I was expecting more from a GoW game. Lots of QTE too but most of the time they're not intrusive. Now about the bad things... except for Kratos\, Atreus and Freya\, I didn't like how the other NPCs were characterized. Totally disappointed by the main antagonist too. He could have been pretty good as a pre-ending boss fight\, but when I saw it was really over I couldn't stop myself thinking if there was somethin' else planned and it was cut to make a sequel\, since the ending is so badly open that it made me feel like I wanted to know more but nope... have to wait X years to know it\, maybe on PS5 or 6\, if I'm still alive. Anyway\, the antagonist is never a real threat\, although again\, cutscenes and boss fights are really well done. Though the interesting boss fights are just a few and for the rest you meet the same enemies with just different name and colors. This thing really annoyed me just like it did with The Witcher III (but that was open world so I can kinda forgive that) and it's disappointing seeing that this is probably the weakest point of the game. 5 long years of developing and no one at Santa Monica stood up saying \""wait\, are we really going to just copy and past the same enemies with a different color?\"" Another bad thing is the quest/collectibles system. I thought games would move away from this basic structure where you have to follow repetitive and shallow quest lines or find every X number of items to get 100%. The game can last 60 hours this way but honestly... it didn't have to. This is why I can give it a 8/10. Definitely one of the best games of 2018\, but the above mentioned imperfections can't really make me say \""woah\, it's a masterpiece\"". I hope Cory and Santa Monica will really innovate the series with the sequel.… Expand"

I am a returning fan of the series\, having played GoW (PS2\, PS3) GoW 2 (PS2\, PS3) and GoW 3\, as well as Ghost of Sparta and Chains of Olympus (Not ascension though).I will try to avoid spoiling as much as I can of this games storyline\, but the base information about it is that you are trying to bring Atreus mothers ashes to the top of the highest peak in all the realms\, and on this journey you have to (Of course\, with all god of war games) Carve a pathway through foes. Now\, on to the Gameplay mechanics:Combat: I loved the combat\, in my personal opinion the combat is very smooth\, providing fun gameplay unless you prefer to stay at a distance (Which is unfortunately basically mandatory for Give me God of War difficulty for a good long while) The enemies are rather well balanced out\, I personally only have issues with Revenant opponents. The combat can get rather dull though\, if you decide to stick to one type of combat (Like staying with Leviathan or the second weapon\, or even melee) So I prefer personally to mix up my combat.Storyline: The storyline is great\, in all honesty. I do dislike the sheer amount of Cutscenes you have to go through though\, and wish that they would've added a skip option at the very least\, however other then that one issue (Which is rather small\, in my opinion) I would say the storyline is good\, however I do dislike how Kratos isn't as close to the original bloodthirsty spartan he used to be\, but at the same time he does have a son now and wants to bury his past and shield Atreus from it.Replayability/Playability: The game is long\, very\, very long. The storyline can take a while to complete\, I think 12 hours? The amount of work for a completionist though is double\, possibly TRIPLE that however. There was actually meant to be a NG+ (New Game +) But it wasn't able to be finished in time\, and I am sure they will add it in future updatesGraphics: There isn't much to say here other then the fact that the graphics are beautiful.  My personal favorite realm to go to is Muspelheim or Alfheim\, as they are honestly the best looking realms (Considering the Realm Travel Room and actual looks and designs of them)Overall\, I absolutely love God Of War\, I do not think it falls short of its other titles at all\, and is a bold attempt to go a new direction\, and look forward to Santa Monica Studios next God of War game. However my only gripe is that New Game Plus is currently not in game\, which would add a whole new level of gameplay for me to do at the very beginning\, but Give me God of War is enough to satisfy me for now.… Expand"

I would like to stress that unlike other \""cinematic\"" games that leave the player feeling more like a spectator than a participant\, God of War's unique camera choices and seamless narrative enhance your connection and investment with the story and characters. Big\, epic set pieces are a hallmark of this franchise\, and never before has the exchange between well executed scripted scenes\, and exciting organic gameplay felt better. What's more\, the game has a deft enough touch to deliver on powerful quiet moments\, as well moments which involve towering monsters and copious violence.Indeed\, the narrative of God of War thrives on this balance\, as we accompany an older\, wiser\, and more measured Kratos attempting to pass on the wisdom he has gained from a lifetime of fruitless bloodlust. This task is further strained by his frequent inability to communicate with his son. What is left unsaid is usually the thing that is tearing at the players mind after moments of critical dialogue. Once again\, this is impressive subtlety for a game that will see you chopping off heads and ripping monsters in half. Yet the dichotomy works. Arguably\, the dichotomy is the point.From a gameplay perspective\, third person brawling has never felt better. The kit of available skills\, weapons\, moves\, and playstyles is wide ranging. No matter how you choose to play\, you're guaranteed a kinetic\, frenzied\, and exciting experience. Blows land with a palpable meatiness\, and hard to execute techniques and challenging foes feel great to conquer. The RPG style progression also ensures that you'll always have a new move\, ability\, or perk to play with\, keeping the combat fresh throughout the considerably lengthy campaign.Puzzles are perhaps a weak point. While they are used smartly to provide breathing room between battles\, they often take the form of merely searching an area for interactive elements rather than requiring much logic. In some cases\, they are rather a sort of minigame whereby players must perform actions quickly and precisely\, which is fine.Some have argued that God of War suffers for lack of enemy variety. I did not find this to be a serious problem\, because of the way old enemies are remixed and reimagined in new combinations and with surprising new moves and abilities as the game goes on. Even the frequent Troll minibosses will seldom play out the same way twice. Rather\, I found the enemies offer a nice balance of challenges\, requiring you to use almost ever trick the game offers at some point or another throughout your adventure.Overall\, this reimagining of God of War is a fine demonstration of how far games have come since the inception of the series. The story is well written and well delivered by compelling voice actors. The narrative contains a full compliment of intelligent literary devices. The world is rich\, cohesive and beautiful. Perhaps most importantly\, the gameplay is superb\, and will keep you coming back for more long after the main campaign is complete. This is a must have for every PS4 owner.… Expand"

I beat the whole game and am still playing it till this day. The story is intriguing and I struggled to stay away from the game until I finished it. The game has this way of making you go back to places you've visited and they still feel fresh even though the world is considerably huge.The music in this game is amazing\, in my opinion at least\, it has a very fitting soundtrack\, the type you would listen to on a trip surprisingly enough. Also\, although the game lacks in boss battles\, all the boss battles mean something and are important to the story. You could also say there are a lot of bosses if you include the Valkyries as bosses\, which I personally do\, and I think this is one of the funnest side quest in the game- although they can get really tough. The only tedious thing in this game are the Odin's raven which are only necessary when 100%ing the game\, which I will be doing.Overall\, I rate this game very highly and definitely suggest you play it from start to finishAlso\, the side character isn't useless which I'd like to see in more games-Alse… Expand"

No matter how hard I try to enjoy them\, I always end up finding them to be boring and too linear for my taste. The Walking Dead\, Life is Strange\, Until Dawn\, hell even The Last of Us\, I cannot get into any of these games. So when I tell you that God of War gave me one of the greatest experiences I've ever had with a video game\, that should be seen as a testament to how amazing this game is.Now\, I was not fully immersed the second I started playing the game\, as it does start off with a slow walking segment for the first 10-20 minutes or so\, but as soon as I tried out the combat for the first time I found it very difficult to put down the controller. Almost everything about the combat works so well\, and it is some of the most satisfying gameplay you will ever experience. The way that Kratos is able to destroy enemies at close range and throw his axe at them from afar then call it back was put together perfectly\, and it is almost always reliable. But\, combat is not the only part of this game's gameplay\, as you often have to solve puzzles too. These go perfectly in combination with the combat segments\, as it balances the game between axe-swinging action and puzzle-solving/dialogue sections. Overall\, this game has top notch gameplay\, which is something I have never been able to say for any other narrative-driven title.I don't want to spoil the story for you\, as this is one that must be experienced on your own\, but I will go over some of its key elements. The plot centers around Kratos\, the protagonist of the God of War games\, living in the realm of Midgard with his son Atreus\, where the two go on a long journey to spread the ashes of Kratos' now deceased wife from the tallest peak in the realm. Along the way they encounter several Norse-mythological characters\, towering bosses\, and two mysterious blacksmiths. I won't go any further in detail\, but should warn you that there will be some seriously shocking moments throughout the course of the game. As I have said\, I am not a fan of narrative-driven games\, and I especially don't like it when the story takes the center stage rather than the gameplay\, but the way that God of War is able to balance its story out with its gameplay is a remarkable achievement. And\, needless to say\, the story is fantastic\, and includes some of the most memorable dialogue in gaming history. Also\, I love the father-son relationship between Kratos and Atreus\, as Kratos deeply cares about his son but is hard on him because he is young and naïve about the world around him. Thankfully\, Atreus never once feels like a burden on the game\, in both its story and its gameplay\, which made him a truly excellent character in my opinion. All and all\, this game's story and characters are top notch\, and you definitely don't want to miss out on experiencing them for yourself.Some of the other elements of this game I loved would be its surprising large amount of customizations and skill trees for Kratos and Atreus\, the fun and satisfying boss fights\, the attention to detail in all of the game's worlds\, and the enjoyable side missions. However\, even a game this good is not perfect\, as God of War does indeed have some shortcomings. First off\, it felt like there were a lot of moments where the game through way too many enemies at you at one time\, which made it annoyingly frustrating to take all of them out without dying rather than being a fun challenge. Secondly\, there are parts of the story when it drags and feels rather boring. These moments are few and far between\, but still are definitely noticeable. Finally\, the boss variety in this game is not very good\, as you will fight many of the same bosses several times throughout the game\, but they will just be a different color. Not all of the bosses are unoriginal\, but do prepare to feel deja vu with a lot of the bosses in this game.In the end\, even though it does have a few problems\, God of War is a true video game masterpiece that must be experienced by every gamer. Even if you are not a fan of narrative-driven games (like me)\, I highly suggest you play this game\, as it is one of the most amazing video game experiences from start to finish.… Expand"

As much as I hate to admit it it was part of the reason why I got a PS4 to begin with and I must say that it has so far been a very\, VERY bitter purchase.This is a game that has about 30% of actual\, real content inside of it. This is the story\, and all the story-related content; as long as you stay on the path\, do not attempt to stray far from the objectives and only backtrack when the game makes it an explicit goal to do so\, the game is great\, because it feels like God of War. You're playing an actual\, well built\, competently made video game designed to be fun and enticing and everything about it shines except perhaps the Alfheim segments which are not very good.However\, there is another 70% to this game. A big\, disgusting\, horrible 70% made entirely of repetitive\, asinine content which one would find in nearly every game of this ilk - that is\, games which were once linear\, and were shoehorned into an unfitting\, ill-designed open world format which only serves to make the games horrible in every way possible.As a game centered around combat GOW excels so long as the fights are actually tailored to suit the combat system; sadly this means there is only one difficulty worth playing\, normal\, as everything else is simply NOT designed intelligently and consists mostly of randomly increased stats for the enemies and randomly decreased stats for the player. If you attempt to touch easy or hard\, you'll end up either fighting vegetables who die in a couple hits or hyperactive one-hit-kill enemies. This also extends to the side content which\, no matter the difficulty\, has seemingly gone under no attempt to balance or calibrate the content\, with most of it feeling like randomly generated content at best and an active attempt at sabotage at the worst.This is best exemplified with the long-running\, exhausting\, and frankly obnoxious Valkyrie questline\, which unlocks after the story has been dealt with. Valkyries feel like cut content put haphazardly back into the game with no time devoted to balancing them or making them fun to fight\, and they ramp up in difficulty beyond the point where the player can realistically fight them without cheesing out of their mind. The equipment they give is outright worse than some of the equipment you will get chasing after these winged idiots. You will end up a bitter idiot filled with buyer's remorse as you reach the final one and realize it all amounts to positively **** nothing.Every other complaint and praise you will hear around the game stem from the same paradigm: main story good\, everything else bad. Seeing as the main story is not THAT long if you play it in one go\, which is definitely what you ought to do seeing as this is a game you get rusty at very quickly\, paying full price for a game which is essentially hot garbage for 70% of its content is\, obviously\, kind of a hard buy. Most people will never touch this awful\, awful side content. I am convinced none of the journalists who gave this a 10 did either\, or they didn't play above easy mode. The only reason it is here is to bait completionists and achievement hunters into playing this game for more than it's worth\, and I must say that\, having bought and played this as my first PS4 game ever\, I bitterly regret my purchase as virtually anything more than some pretty tech demo that really does not know when enough is enough.… Expand"

Even so for me it was enough and good to discover some parts of the mythology and the story. (And the biome\, was crying after see so many beautiful views in a game.)Also 5 worlds to see. Not much from 3 of them but enough.Lack of enemies. Sure to beat the same mini-boss many times but with different elements (or that) feels repetitive but different. Good with the bosses\, they where powerful in their ways and challenging some of them. Sad not every boss got a part of the biome destroyed like with The Stranger at the start of the game. (Loved the scene when the Dragon exploded and then Kratos stands up in the middle of the Dragons mount. Such a godlike view put on as wallpaper.) I would have loved to see more type of attacks on the bosses but OK.Loved the Valkyries too\, still after the rage with the last one.Cinematic was truly AWESOME.

This is God of War meets The Last of Us and Dark Souls\, in an open world RPG environment.Kratos is an older\, bearded and surprisingly calm character who has moved from ancient Greece to the Nordic lands. Kratos now has a 10-years-old son named Atreus\, and tries to teach him about survival and how to grow up. Along their journey to honor the last wish of Kratos' wife and Atreus' mother Faye who has passed away\, they encounter many different kinds of beings and deities from the Norse mythology. The storyline is great and more human than past games\, it will appeal especially to parents. The game's narrative has shifted to a more filmic approach\, with the camera being close to Kratos' shoulder (Resident Evil 4-style). The camera is innovative in that it's a single cut for the whole game\, there are no black screens between gameplay and real-time cut-scenes.Gameplay has changed into a Dark Souls style of open world RPG action game\, with a challenging combat. Action mostly takes place on a single large map (Midgard) but there are 5 smaller ones (based on the 9 Realms of Norse mythology) to explore\, too. The main story path is a series of linear levels inside an open map\, but you can also perform other standard open world side activities (errands\, side quests\, challenges\, etc.) in any order you want. That way you gain XP\, materials and money to upgrade your stats\, skills and equipment. There is no platforming\, but there are some environmental puzzles like in the old games. Combat is very much like Dark Souls\, you have a shield on one hand and a melee weapon in the other\, plus some magical attacks. Atreus can help Kratos in battle\, by distracting enemies and/or slightly damaging them with his arrows.Graphics in this game are beautiful\, the best on PS4 along with Horizon: Zero Dawn and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. On PS4 the game runs at 1080p/30 fps\, on PS4 Pro you can choose between performance mode (unlocked frame rate 40-50 fps at 1080p) or resolution mode (checkerboard 4K at 30 fps). The soundtrack is also great. Voice acting is stellar.This game is great\, but isn't perfect. Even though Midgard is a big open map\, there are no roaming NPCs at all. Opening chests in this game usually means solving some boring environmental puzzles\, and it can get tiresome. Boss fights are very few\, you battle one certain enemy 3 or 4 times across the journey\, and there are another 2 bosses (a duo and the dragon). Trolls and Ancients are really mini-bosses after you encounter these for the 1st time. The lack of big boss fights leaves you with the sense the game is a prelude to a sequel (especially considering the secret ending). Most enemies are fairly challenging and fun to battle\, but there are some unfair encounters where high-level enemies can one-shot you even with the shield up. And because the camera is very close\, you will sometimes be hit by your left or right when surrounded by entire mobs and die without seeing it coming. The human-sized enemies are OK to battle\, but the larger ones are disappointing. Trolls are repetitive\, the stone-made Ancients are horrible (you have to throw the axe to their chests when open). But the Dragon boss fight in particular was a poorly-designed attempt at battling a gigantic foe in a small arena. Nothing will ever top the Kronos battle in God of War 3.TLDR: God of War is an open world action RPG game with an actually great story to follow. The main story is 15-20 hours long\, and expect to spend even more time than that on side content. It's the ideal mix of linear games and open world games\, without too much linearity and with no filler content typical of open world games.If you like games such as The Last of Us\, Dark Souls and open world RPGs\, you 'll like this new version of God of War\, but if you can't get past the old games\, this may not be for you.… Expand"

But I didn't expect it would be The God of War - the pinnacle of a present console gaming. I have waited long enough for getting a PS\, but seeing videos and gameplays I knew this is the one.I am sure that this game deserves all praises\, but only when played on a hardest difficulty (Give Me God of War). Of course\, it applies only to gameplay\, not the amazing sound\, music\, voice acting\, story and graphics. These things are obvious and their excellent quality shouldn't be even a topic of discussion.The combat is fair. With a good equipment there were times when I was slashing through foes without a problem\, and sometimes one guy was giving me hard times. I never even once thought that I died because of some injustice - getting hit is always your fault. That's why every fight was satisfying\, especially when I was out of a rezz stones. The Boy and The Head are great help in fights and their warnings helped me many times. Not saying that their banter is sometimes hilarious. You need to be totally without any sense of humour to not appreciate dialogues in this game.There are 16 types of enemies\, and they all have at least 3 forms - with different move sets or powers (but true\, sometimes only kind of element affiliation). It can be not enough if you expect a new type of enemy appear every 30 minutes. For example\, in Horizon Zero Dawn you have 29 types. For me it was more than enough. At least I mostly remembered their move sets and could fight with them efficiently. In addition\, they were also getting better when you let them level up during a fight.  I can imagine that at lower difficulty\, when you are just butchering everything with few hits it can become an issue. Only boss fights seemed lacking\, but at least the final one was good\, and wasn't a quick time event.The puzzles for me were a OK. Exactly on a level that you would expect from something like Action-RPG.The average time to complete the story + some extras seems to be around 25 hours\, which is enough in my opinion. Much more than previous God of War games\, half more than Last of Us\, and similar to a story-only run in Horizon Zero Dawn. Something around half less than Witcher 3\, Dark Souls or Bloodborne. I know that this comparison is all around the place but you I think it serves its purpose.In my opinion God of War is nearly a perfect game in its genre and I will recommend this game to everybody.… Expand"

The continuous camera is so well implemented and it really feels as if youre following kratos through is story instead of playing a game.The combat is extremely satisfying and weighty. While it is clearly derived from Soulsborne-esque games\, it has its own nice twist on it with the abilities specific to kratos.The only notable flaws I could really point out with the game is the lack of enemy variety and the performance. While the boss fights are there (with some of them being seriously epic) every time you think youre going to have another big fight\, they just throw the same stupid trolls at you that are extremely easy to take down even on the harder difficulties.The performance on the PS4 Pro is a tad disappointing as the performance mode definitely does not hold to 60fps often and I constantly feel the drops. But it's way better and easier to play on the variable performance mode than a sluggish 30fps cap with checkerboard rendering artifacts that stand out like a sore thumb.Overall this game deserves all the success and praise it has gotten.… Expand"

Game is excellent and well deserves its praise and score 10 out of 10 - as a game and hell as a GoW game too. Its jawdropping\, stunning\, amazing\, fascinating - I just love it and really must admit I wrote my first stupid review without playing the game which was just straight dumb because I love original GoW and was sorely disapointed by next titles. It still doesnt connect with GoW 1 and could be titled as anything else BUT Kratos is badass and he just fits here perfectly so maybe instead of looking for some reason to hate it I should try the game first.… Expand"

I did really like the game overall\, it has a lot of interesting things going for it\, like huge creatures that look amazing\, many of the enemy encounters were great\, and the visuals - just wow! the characters look amazing - especially Kratos. the details on him are simply wonderful to look at.this game might be the best-looking this gen\, at least from a technical standpoint. there is so much detail everywhere and in everything\, and I played this on a Ps4 slim\, which is comparable to the base Ps4 in terms of power.the Ps4 is truly a powerful little machine\, capable of graphics & performance such as this game\, I'm just amazed.overall: a very good game with great high's\, but also disappointing low's. there are several times in the game it feels like a chore\, and this can last for several hours so that isn't fun. but there is also much greatness to it\, like enemy encounters\, the visuals\, up-grading your characters weapons and equipment\, and some of the vistas are also interesting.… Expand"

La variedad de enemigos en cuanto a diseño es relativamente baja. A lo largo del juego nos vamos a encontrar en su mayoría con el mismo tipo de enemigo pero controlando elementos diferentes\, por ejemplo los troles o los antiguos de piedra\, que son iguales pero algunos controlan hielo\, otros el fuego\, etc. Ojo\, está falta de variedad en diseño no se refleja en el combate\, ya que el hecho de que controlen diferentes elementos nos obliga a enfrentarlos de formas diferentes\, así que no es del todo malo.. El final. No me malinterpreten\, es bueno el final\, pero no me llenó de la misma forma que lo hizo un momento que hubo en la mitad del juego. Quien lo jugó sabrá de qué momento hablo.

This is something that I have been meaning to sit down and write for almost a month now. For Kratos\, it was a herculean task to talk to his son and for me it’s writing about this damn game.It has such an interesting start and its something that you don’t quite pick up on the first time you play the game. Right off the bat\, there is this tension between Kratos and his son Atreus. It’s an awkward tension where both parties are clearly upset about something. It reminds me of when you meet up with family and you can instantly tell something happened. The kid is quiet and doesn’t want to say anything\, the parents are on edge but want to pretend like everything is fine. There is tension in the air and all it does is put you in this awkward position. That is how I would describe the start of this game.With the way this game starts\, that’s what makes the games narrative so interesting. As you progress through the game\, there are a lot of moving parts but it all synchronizes so perfectly. You get bits and pieces of Kratos\, his former life and how he is trying to escape his past but you’re never able to completely wipe that away. You also have the relationship of Atreus and Kratos and watching that evolve and my favorite part of this game. The Norse Mythology lore and how Santa Monica (The Developers) have intertwined a Greek God into the Norse Mythology.As great as the narrative the forefront of this game is the gameplay itself. You start out with an axe called the Leviathan axe and its perfect. Its so perfect\, I love using the axe. There is a weight to the combat\, it feels good to hit people with the axe but it goes further than that\, you can also throw the axe. Then after you throw the axe\, you the hit triangle button on the PlayStation controller and its right back. As much fun as it was to throw the axe\, I would on occasion exploit it a little bit in the boss battles. If I was struggling in a fight\, I would just keep my distance and then just throw the axe and then recall it. Just do that over and over again until the boss was down. It doesn’t work on all of the bosses but it does work for one specific boss type.The other main combat mechanic is your son\, Atreus. He has a bow and arrow and he will use it in combat and he is very useful. He gets a couple different types of arrows and one of them and one them staggers the enemies which is very useful. Its also interesting to watch Atreus in the combat arena\, as the game progressed he clearly improved and became much more confident in himself.I am not going to sit here and say its a perfect game because it isn’t but sitting here thinking about the game. I don’t have any major gripes with the game. I guess there could be more enemy variation but I really enjoyed my time with the game. I think the length is perfect\, the combat is fun and the story is engaging. That’s all I want out of a video game.… Expand"

Mitoloji demişken\, Yunan mitolojisinde artık keseceğimiz\, böğrünü deleceğimiz ve hatta içinden geçeceğimiz Tanrı kalmadığından artık ister istemez ikinci popüler mitoloji olan İskandinav mitolojisine geçiş yapmışGod of WarBence;Yılın oyununa en büyük aday. Tüm bildiğiniz God of War'ları unutun. Bu her şeyiyle bambaşka bir oyun\, bambaşka iki karakter\, bambaşka bir mitoloji. Mitoloji demişken\, Yunan mitolojisinde artık keseceğimiz\, böğrünü deleceğimiz ve hatta içinden geçeceğimiz Tanrı kalmadığından artık ister istemez ikinci popüler mitoloji olan İskandinav mitolojisine geçiş yapmış bulunuyoruz. Bundan sonra Mısır mitolojisi ve ondan sonra da Roma mitolojisine geçiş yapabiliriz. Nasılsa dünyada mitler çok\, dolayısıyla da keseceğimiz daha yüzlerce tanrı var çok şükür. Allah'ın izniyle bu serimizde sırasıyla Thor ve Odin'i kestikten sonra diğer serilerde başka başka tanrılar kesebiliriz.Öncelikle\, oyun diğer serilerden çok çok farklı olması sebebiyle Kratos'un İskandinav mitolojisine uyarlanarak bambaşka bir karakter olduğunu savunan hatrı sayılır sayıda bir kesim var ancak oyun içerisinde bunun öyle olmadığını anlatan bir çok hikaye de mevcut. Özellikle artık oyunun ortalarını geçerken ve sona yavaş yavaş yaklaştırken Kratos'un geçmişiyle yüzleşme sahneleri bizi \""tamam\, evet\, bizim yağız delikanlı\, moruk olmuş\"" dedirtiyor.İlk olarak oyun bizi sessiz sakin İskandinav topraklarındaki evimizde\, merhum eşimize cenaze hazırlıkları yaparken\, başımıza kalmış bir evlatla karşılıyor. Yeni mitlojik hikayemizin en başı ama yaşamımızın artık sonlarına yakın bir bölümü konu olacak. Yaşlanmışız\, göç etmişiz\, yaşlanmışız\, geçmişten arınmaya çalışmışız\, yuva kurmuşuz\, yaşlanmışız\, çocuk sahibi bile olmuşuz. Ha bu arada yaşlanmışız demiş miydim? Evet götümüzün kılları ağarmış ve bunlar olurkenki hikayeyi oynamak ya da görmek zorunda kalmıyoruz. Zeus'u kestikten sonra geçen sürecin büyük bir çoğunluğu sizin zihninize bırakılmış\, yani en azından şimdilik.Oğlumuz Atreus ile beraber eşimizin küllerini en yüksek  dağın tepesinden atmakla görevlendiriliyoruz ve yolculuğumuz başlıyor. Aslında başlamadan önce oyunun en zorlu boss fight'ını da yapıyoruz bu arada. O kadar hızlı başlıyorki oyun bir an \""önceki seri bok yemiş npc* keser gibi boss kesecez açılın mk\"" diye çıkıyorsunuz yola ancak hiç de öyle olmuyor. İyi ki de olmuyor. İlk dövüşümüzden sonra oyun o kadar güzel bir ivmeyle yükseliyor ki son sahneye kadar ve hatta ondan sonrasında bile dayanılmaz yükselişimiz sürekli devam ediyor. Yolculuğumuz esnasında\, daha önce sürekli evden uzakta olmamızdan ötürü vakit geçiremediğimiz oğlumuzla arayı düzeltiyor ve ona bildiklerimizi sürekli öğretiyoruz. Yani kısacası baba-oğul olma yolculuğu temalı serinin ilk oyunu.Seri demişken\, isminin God of War 4 olmaması beni o kadar çok mutlu etti ki anlatamam. Bir sayı vereceksen git ilk serideki oyunlara ver Star Wars serisinde olduğu gibi ya da bu şekilde direk oyun ismiyle giriş yap.Hikayeye çocuk ekleme temasını ilk olarak The Last of Us'da gördüm. Daha önce kesin vardır ama beni en çok etkileyen ilk en azından. Hikaye içerisine cuk diye oturuyordu ve hatta en sevdiğim hikayelerden biridir kendisi ki korku ve gerilim türünden nefret ederim. Bu konuya daha sonra değineceğim. Daha sonra X-man serisi olan Logan da karşımıza çıktı. Bu hikaye de çok sevildi ki bence de iyi işlenmişti\, bazı eksikleri olsa da. Şimdi God of War'da işleniyor. Bu da çok iyi oturtulmuş hikayeye. Severek oynadık\, izledik.oyun bize kesintisiz bir TPS* deneyimi sunuyor. Bu bakımdan bu kadar sık dövüşe girdiğimiz bir oyunda bizi sıkıntıya sokacağını düşünsek de oynarken bu durumdan hiç rahatsız olmuyoruz. Aksine omuz kamerasını çoğu zaman bir filmin içinde hissetmek için kullandığımızı bile söyleyebilirim. Yarı açık dünyası santim santim işenmiş ve neredeyse açık dünya* kadar etkili ancak o kadar da efektif değil. RPG* etkileri ise hikaye modunda sizi çok zorlamasa da hikayeyi bitirdikten sonra tüm yan görevleri tamamlamak için Gear kasma ihtiyacı duyacağınız cinsten. Ayrıca söylemeden geçemeyeceğim. Oyunda hikaye olarak bize aktarılmak istenen tüm anlatımı durarak\, zaman öldürerek ya da ara sahnelerle değil. Hikayenin bir kısmında bizimle beraber seyahat eden bir kafadan tekne sürerken ya da portaldan geçerken dinliyoruz. Bu çok efsane olmuş bence. Oynanışla alakalı diğer durum ise Santa Monica'nın çok iyi kullandığı ve genellikle boss fightlarının sonunda bitiş animasyonları izlenirken karşımıza çıkan QTE*lerin neredeyse tamamen kaldırılmış olmasıydı. Bu durumu da çok olumlu karşıladı. Oldum olası QTE'lerden nefret etmişimdir. Çünkü beni tamamen büyüden çıkarıyorlar. Ulan herifi kesmişim zaten. Bitiş animasyonunu izlemek yerine neden bir kaç tuşu takip etmek için kendimi kasayım ki?… Expand"

All aspects of the game are superb and the minor flaws barley detract from the experience at all. From a technical standpoint the game is incredible. Graphically it is one of the best. The atmosphere\, looming fogs in the distance\, snow covered mountain peaks\, great mystical realms and scope are all here to make one of the best looking games of all time. The sound effects are pitch perfect and the voice acting is amazing. The music is also a big part of the experience and its one of the best in gaming. The universe and world expands to you as you go further and further into the game uncovering the secrets and mysteries of the realms. Kratos and Atreus have a perfect bond and relationship that elevates the story. Kratos constantly scolding his son to form him into something better and Atreus just wanting a father that approves of him. The villain is charismatic and intimidating with clear motives. The story is focused and paced perfectly filled with a great cast\, and best of all the scope and magnitude of the bombastic battles is unmatched. The combat feels fantastic weight to it. Parrying\, dodging\, light and heavy attacks are all pitch perfect. Runic attacks add more depth and ways to take out your enemies. Upgrading Kratos' abilities and improving his gear feels personalized and all the role playing elements are great. Rage mode and executions add the gore and brutal violence the series is known for. Creating different builds and discovering new ways to take on the creative and diverse enemies and bosses is rewarding. The boss fights are amazing and have great thrilling moments. Exploring the world and side quests is fun and they offer great rewards adding to the replay value. The environmental puzzles and runic chests require some brain power and are quite fun. There are some minor inconveniences with the annoying fast travel and some repetitive enemies but they are so small it is barley noticeable. I don't want to seem like a fan boy but i have never played a God of War game and seeing this change up the formula made me want to try it. I have few bad to say and so much to gush for hours about.

Empecé a jugar después de que lo nombrarán GOTY y mis expectativas eran bastante altas tras haber jugado al RDR2. Empiezo por los defectos que le he encontrado y luego comento lo que me ha gustado.El primer punto es la dificultad\, en mi opinión mal gestionada. Jugando en fácil los enemigos de la historia principal están desequilibrados en comparación con los de las actividades secundarias. Si aumentas la dificultad no se corrige lo único que aumenta es el tiempo que tardas en derrotar a los enemigos haciendo la experiencia más tediosa. Creo que falta un punto medio entre la dificultad fácil y la normal para encontrar el punto óptimo\, al menos para mi.Precisamente los enemigos son el otro punto débil que veo\, no hay demasiada variedad y las animaciones de ejecución son siempre las mismas o varia entre 2 a lo sumo. Debido a la mala experiencia que he tenido jugando no he realizado muchas actividades secundarias pero tengo la impresión de que en estas actividades es posible que si haya enemigos más variados. No obstante\, de ser así no entiendo por qué no los han incluido en la historia principal.El sistema de combate no me ha resultado divertido y los movimientos que vas desbloqueando no mejoran la experiencia (con la excepción del golpe fuerte del hacha). He tenido la sensación de que es indiferente el ataque que realices porque todos hacen el mismo daño incluidos los combos. Esto enlaza con el tema de la dificultad\, creo que falta un equilibrio entre la vida de los enemigos y el daño que debería hacer y recibir Kratos teniendo en cuenta quien es.Hay unos cuantos fallos de diseño y usabilidad como por ejemplo al abrir caminos hacia atrás tirando cadenas por una pared\, Kratos siempre se cuelga de la cadena independientemente de que queramos o no bajar (normalmente es que no)\, o elementos que debemos utilizar en unos combates obligatoriamente pero en otros no podemos utilizarlos pese a que están en el escenario y desde un punto de vista argumental sería completamente aceptable.El sistema de runas y armaduras le añade una capa de profundidad que creo que no se necesita ni se llega a aprovechar all 100%. Sin embargo la progresión de las armas y de los personajes si me parece acertada y creo que funciona muy bien en un juego de estas características.En cuanto a la historia como conjunto me ha gustado\, no conocía a penas la mitología nórdica y me ha interesado bastante. Los distintos personajes que salen tienen un gran diseño y personalidad\, sin embargo hay bastantes puntos que no me parecen coherentes\, como la misma premisa de la historia o los cambios de humor y moralidad repentinos del hijo.La evolución de Kratos creo que es lo que salva todo el juego\, ver su faceta de padre y sus luchas y dudas internas es verdaderamente emotivo.Por último\, gráficamente es espectacular\, de los mejores gráficos que he visto y la ambientación suma una gran cantidad de recuerdos imborrables a la experiencia. El modo foto está bastante logrado y puedes sacar infinidad de fondos de pantalla de cada momento del juego.En conclusión\, me ha resultado un experiencia agridulce\, disfrutar de la historia y los gráficos me ha gustado mucho pero la jugabilidad me ha planteado muchas dudas a lo largo de todo el juego.Personalmente no lo recomendaría a nadie que no haya jugado los juegos anteriores\, acabo de finalizar el GOW 3 y puedo entender la emoción con la que los fans han recibido este juego. Sin embargo\, para una persona que entre nueva a la saga no creo que lo pueda disfrutar igual.Historia 7\, Jugabilidad 5\, Gráficos 10… Expand"

The previous games in the series had an amazing combat and graphics for its time\, but they lacked an interesting story\, the world exploration was also very limited and the greek lore was not well exposed in game. This games nails at everything:- Combat: I was worried that changing the blades to the axe was going to turn the combat more boring\, but actually I loved the axe! With the axe you now feel that the combat is more personal\, and along with the amazing ice abilities of the axe the combat turns out to be amazing. Atreus is really helpful too later in the game with his bow.- Norse Lore: In this game the mythology lore is much more exposed to the players! In the world you find shrines and pages that make you understand the main features of norse mythology (Aesir-Vanir war\, the Giants suffering in the hands of the Aesir gods\, the 9 realms\, etc)\, making you feel really immersed in the world. You also latter in the game you will have a companion that will provide even detailed information about the gods. I recommend you to do a 10 min search in google to see the main features of norse mythology and the main Gods to help you immerse even more.- Graphics: Hands down one of the best looking games of this generation. All god of war games had amazing graphics back when they launched\, and this game is the same. The difference is that here the world is more open to you and as so you can appreciate even more the amazing landscapes.- World building: The world now is more open to the player when compared to the linear paths of previous GOW games\, you also some side quests that are not very interesting but allow you to explore the world and to adquire loot that is going to be useful for your journey. Along with the breathtaking graphics you can really feel immersed in this world\, being far more interesting than the linear paths of previous games.- Crafting: now you can craft your and your son armour and upgrade your weapons\, It is a not very deep system but is a nice addition to make the world exploration meaningful.-Journey/story : The journey Itself is very simple\, you must deliver your wife ashes to the highest peak of the REALMS\, but the journey itself is pretty nice\, you meet a lot of interesting characters and obstacles\, that will tight the bond between Kratos and his son. Their relation is one of the main aspects of this game and it is very nice to see its evolution. Along the game there are some references to previous games that give a strong nostalgia feel for previous GOW players\, but If you did not play the previous games worry not because you can completely enjoy this game.Overall is an amazing game\, that for me does not reach the 10/10 score due to low enemy variety and to some boring side-quests.

What is does have is dumb fun and cool ways to kill monsters with an axe and other god-like powers. It's great for the typical Uncharted fan who wants more of a fantasy setting.I don't particularly like Uncharted and had my fill of the series after playing only part 4. And after starting up this game\, for only a few hours\, I found that it's Uncharted 4 all over again\, just slightly different. For example: Disposable beautiful environments that you only see once\, enemies or climbing sections around every corner for no good story reason\, and a threadbare story that's there to make you feel cool/special/powerful without getting in the way of the gameplay.I was initially pleased by the dynamic between father (protagonist) and son\, with the father being overly strict as to man-up his scrawny mama's boy of a son. Though that gets toned down quickly and I started seeing several instances where the father characteristically should have taught/disciplined his son\, but he didn't. I assume the writers didn't want people thinking the protagonist was a total jerk\, so they decided to tone down his strictness\, at the expense of believability.Magical nonsense also happens frequently in the game. I was initially relieved at the introduction of a witch character as I was started to get bored\, but she quickly turns into a tool to get you over pits and to new areas. Why she does this makes no logical sense\, but in this game\, gameplay and progression come before storytelling. And then there's a pair of dwarves that just show up randomly where you happen to be so you can upgrade your equipment. When one was pressed about how he got to a certain place so quickly\, he eventually told us that it was because of his secret magic. Again\, gameplay is more important than story consistency.I got increasingly annoyed by the story and repetitive gameplay that I gave up.

God of War however\, is difficult for all the wrong reasons!After investing quite a few hours into the game\, God of War felt as though it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be From Software game or a Naughty Dog game and as a result\, it failed at both.The combat had potential to be outstanding with great mechanics such as the Leviathan axe throw and recall\, but with the extremely bland and uninspiring enemy design this adds very little value to the underwhelming game play experience.Unfortunately\, the enemies are just absolute damage sponges\, and this results in long\, overly drawn out combat which becomes boring and repetitive very quickly!Even many of the boss fights\, though they look impressive\, are just plain\, robotic and follow the same pattern of attacks.A boss fight should be exciting and an opportunity to execute the array of skills you have developed throughout the game up to that point.Unfortunately\, The only thought I had when encountering a boss was **** here’s another enemy with a **** ton of health…”For these reasons\, I actually found myself dreading each enemy encounter and the only satisfaction I found when clearing an area of enemies was the thought of \""Thank **** that's over\""\, and that’s only because I was now slightly closer to finishing the game.God of War gave me no incentive or desire to explore anywhere outside of the direct route I was required to follow in order to progress in the main quest line.Most of the crates I opened rarely contained anything of interest and in addition to this\, most of the time I was required to complete some kind of mundane puzzle in order to open said crates…Next up\, we have the upgrade system. At first glance it looks overly complex and maybe even a touch overwhelming. In reality though\, it’s actually very simplistic and as a result\, upgrading Kratos and Atreus is quite dull and uninspiring to say the least.Let's wrap this up by discussing the \""story\""\, or lack there of....Let me summarize it for you…Climb up a mountain to scatter the ashes of some dead chick who you (as a player) never got to see and therefore form any kind of connection with during the game...Throughout this fascinating Journey\, you will also be privy to some incredible dialogue between Kratos and Atreus (Kratos’s son).Watch Kratos utilise his extensive vocabulary as he grunts convincingly at Atreus and refers to him as “boy” rather than call him by his actual name…Also\, speaking of Atreus… I can honestly say that I don’t think I have ever hated a video game character as much as I hate this disobedient and whiny little ****Every cut scene where I was forced to stare at his **** ugly face just irritated me to no end!Maybe if the main plot line of the game was to burn this little **** alive and throw his ashes off the edge of the mountain\, rather than his dead mother\, I would have enjoyed it more…… Expand"

This game is the equivalent of eating sunflower seeds on a lazy afternoon but nothing much more than that. It's just OK fun that's why i can't wrap my mind around the stellar scores it's received. It's the best example of score inflation in video games just cause there's nothing much going on out there. No real creativity or innovation\, just re-skin the same old game mechanics with some new polish and throw it to the public to eat. It's not a bad game. It's a 7. But i don't see what about it makes it a 10: there's basically no story at all to speak of\, just some filler father and son bonding over mother's ashes that feels like the bare minimum they could have come up with. Compared to the complex story of games like the Witcher series or Metal Gear series\, filled with intrigue and packed with choices to make that shape the world around you\, God of War feels naked. Compared to Dark Souls\, it lacks lore and mystery\,  compared to Bayonetta\, it lacks personality\, Compared to the Metro series\, it lacks atmosphere and compared to Bioshock\, it lacks any originality at all but in the current marketplace that probably hasn't innovated in years it probably stands out.Maybe this game is just a symptom of the overall dryness of current games. They tend to be just rehashes of old tropes with shiny polish. Churn out something new to make a quick buck but don't worry about substance or pushing any boundaries. Just shallow\, comfortable game making. We need something to push the boundaries again\, another Bioshock Infinite for today's games. Not another round of complacency. Is God of War any good?

Not because it was a bad game but because I got too hyped up by all the 10/10 Reviews. The game itself is good but far from perfect. The first problem is the handling of the lore which is done really bad. An example for this would be the first shrine you find telling you about two giant wolfs who chase the sun and moon. Why do they chase them? Where do they come from? These are just two of the questions left open by the very little information given in the shrine. In fact there is no further information on them than what I already said and the questions left behind are never answered\, which is the case with all shrines. The second bad thing is the world. Midgard\, which is the main area of the game\, is in same areans far too big so that it quickly feels repetitive if you encounter the same kind of location with nothing new or notable added to it. The other realms on the other hand are both small\, really small\, and bland. Though they are nice to look at they don't give a feeling of what that realm might look like beyond the places you have seen. The worst bit was when visiting one realm where you see several strange things that are essential to this realm and yet you learn nothing about them making it impossible to get any feeling for these places. The last problem is the story. While it starts good and strong it gets dull rather soon. After five hours into the story it fells even meaningless to some extend. The main story is the journey to the top of the highest mountain and when you supposedly reach this mountain you find out that it isn't the highest one and so spent 80% of your journey with finding a portal to the right mountain\, not even with going there on your own but to find a portal. The end boss\, whom I don't want to spoil\, feels incredible meaningless to the point that I didn't even realise that it was the endboss until the credits rolled. The story reuses the same small range of characters so often that it eventually feels like that moment when deadpool asked where the other X-Men were and whether they simply couldn't afford the big guys so they had to bring in the small side characters no one knew. If not for the great visuals\, the good gameplay and the\, at first\, incredibly thrilling story I would probably score the game a 5/10. Its a decent or even good game but not the game of the generation and most certainly not a 10/10.… Expand"

This is Witcher plus Dark Souls\, yeah. I understand Sony's desire to use well-known title\, but still they should name it different - \""Father and son story\"" perhaps?

What do we have now? Rusty axe\, gloom on Kratos face.Story: Story is good\, but not even close to\, say\, Bioshock Infinite story. I really almost cried when DeWitt died\, I was amazed by idea of stars-doors and time travels\, it was so tangled and enigmatic. Story in GoW is plain simple - father and son\, mothers last wish ... bleh. Even GoW2 had better story lol.Graphics: Amazing and very good. I'm playing on Ps4 Pro on 54\"" 4k UHD TV and some moments are breathtaking. However\, some moments are not good - compare quality of water here and\, say\, in 2007 Crysis. In Crysis you could see through water - water was water\, in GoW water is like blue kissel. Seriously\, in 2007 game water was better.

The game is nothing short of phenomenal.I was skeptical about a reboot\, not because of the gameplay and narrative changes\, but because the series essentially concluded in God of War 3. The series was done in my mind\, and I'd gotten everything I wanted out of it. But I went ahead and pre-ordered this one anyway\, and it definitely got me interested in another round of mythological adventure by presenting so many new aspects to the series\, from the completely reworked gameplay\, to the focus on the narrative and to Kratos himself as a character.This isn't your dad's God of War\, most certainly not. But it's still definitely God of War\, and Kratos's journey as a character is finally becoming more than just the two-dimensional irredeemable tantrum-throwing crybaby that we all still unironically love. Kratos is now much more than that\, and with the context of the previous games on your side\, you'll end up getting a really strong attachment to what his character has become and to the narrative as it plays out\, and you'll definitely catch certain themes repeating themselves through a new perspective that really drives home a powerful message.Graphics-wise\, it's probably the best looking PS4 game alongside the Shadow of the Colossus rework\, and the game gives you plenty to do in it's semi-open world\, packed with locations to explore and sidequests to complete that don't feel like side-stories so much as fitting neatly into the main story should you choose to go off the main path and do some exploring\, all of which never prove pointless as there is always a sweet reward waiting for you at the end of everything you do\, be it a sidequest or just generally exploring.The combat is much slower and more paced than previous entries\, and it requires a mix between attack and defense that you need to balance well in order to succeed. It feels almost like Dark Souls in a sense\, with how strategy will come into play. It also feels almost like Dark Souls in that the game can be go f*** yourself hard. Once you get the hang of it\, though\, you'll find a deeply rewarding combat system that always feels challenging\, sometimes overwhelming\, but rewards those who understand it and can keep a cool head throughout encounters. So basically what I'm saying is that God of War is basically the Dark Souls of Norse mythology\, though faster paced.Atreus\, Kratos's new kid son\, is more of a sidekick than anything else. You're free to treat him as another addition to your arsenal in combat\, as he will act on his own and assist you without you having to do anything\, and you can also give him specific commands when you want him to do something specific\, like interrupt an enemy's attack with some arrows and such. As the game progresses\, he becomes more and more useful to you\, and never once feels like a liability. Outside of combat he is\, of course\, the second half of the narrative of the game\, the dynamic between Kratos and Atreus always being at the center of everything you do in the game\, never once leaving the perspective of the two as the story unfolds and the stakes are raised.There's really only one moment in the game that took me out of the experience and made me feel like I was playing a video game\, and it's a pretty bad bit of gameplay that I hope they patch to make it so it plays itself\, because it would be better for both the gameplay and the narrative if it were the case\, and when it happened I deducted 2 points from my score of it\, bringing it down to a 7 out of 10 instead of the 9 it was cruising at beforehand. But after thinking about it for a bit\, I'm more than willing to forgive one single bit of iffy gameplay design in the context of all the rest of the absolutely brilliant things the game has going for it\, and the game brings everything together wonderfully in the end to add that last point to the score.God of War isn't a perfect game\, but it's definitely one of the best you can get your hands on\, on the PS4\, and in my eyes\, it's absolutely everything it needs to be. Almost nothing feels out of place here\, and everything feels like it's there for a reason. The game feels entirely complete\, both as a game and a story\, which isn't something you see often these days.And all while being single-player only with no monetization bulls***\, no less. Single-player\, story-driven games are far from dead\, and this game proves it\, on top of being proven by all of Sony's other first-party games.This game deserves all the praise it gets.… Expand"

The gore is mostly white washed\, say goodbye to classic GoW disembowelment and hello to ripping people apart to have them burst into...orange goo?

If you are someone that makes a decision based on the first few hours of a game you will be most likely blown away. But then you'll begin to think that perhaps Sony built this game around the absolute bombastic opening moments and the rest of the title be damned.You would be wrong\, you would be so wrong.The content you get in those opening moments is just the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that opening is a masterful weaving of plot\, storytelling\, character development\, and some of the best combat in a long time.The visuals are stunning at the base--factor in HDR and 4K and the movie-quality levels of camera angles and shots and you'll find your jaw dropping more often than not. The music is so pinpoint perfect in the package that I legitimately want to watch the making of the game to get a better insight into just how they went about making this game.The dispassionate Kratos was by far the absolute best touch. If you've finished God of War 3\, this Kratos is the drained of all that rage and anger just from beating Zeus to a bloody pulp. Arteus is the perfect summation of that anger and rage and the need to temper it in a package.God of War is just one of those titles that come along and all the stars align. I could nitpick about things like how I wish the camera might have been just a touch further out during combat or perhaps if they gave the player more options in regards to button mapping\, but they are so small that it really doesn't affect the overall package.This game is a masterpiece. I have a rule about not giving any game an absolute score (10 or 0) because there is no such thing as perfection\, but God of War gets the highest mark I will give. This title is something that would be taught in school for people creating and designing video games.Update* 5/30-I decided on knocking off a point due to the obnoxious amounts of grind-padding towards the end of the game. GOW has always been known for the amount of collecting it has (power-ups for weapons or health etc...) but the sheer worthless amounts of it towards the end game is a downer. Pace-shattering padding and it wasn't really necessary. Most of the gear nominally makes you more powerful\, but beyond tacking Muselphiem early (which I did) the rest of the \""gear\"" isn't all that wonderful.Niefhiem is a god awful idea as is grinding out the \""Best gear in the game\"" (It barely is). Nor is it worth doing the maze over and over and OVER to max it out. Sigun--the hardest boss in the game..I was able to do it with zero upgrades to the set (I was level 8) and did it on normal.My point here is this: Don't waste your time with the grinding\, it breaks the pacing of the story\, the relationship with Kratos and his \""boy\"" and adds so very little to the overarching narrative. Hit the power threshold you need to complete it and move on\, the rest adds nothing.Also\, a minor point for me to raise. To the dev that designed the Winds of Hel: I don't like you very much.

Different\, not better but not worse.PROS:- Graphics are top. The most beautiful game in PS4 right now.- Story is deep and relationship between Kratos and Atreus is very good.- Atreus himself is very useful and he improves gameplay.- Combat is satisfying\, like other GOW games.- It has a little RPG new features that are awesome.CONS:- GOW is about epic scenes killing powerful gods. In here\, there are only 3 epic fights. GOW III has at least 8. I know this game is an introduction of a new trilogy \, but I think there are not enough legendary moments.- You visit 5 realms out of 8 (I think) of all whole Norse Mythology. And they are soooo empty. Midgard itself (the realm where most of the story mode is developed) has 4 or 5 NPCs. Nobody's living there. I hope they will fix it in next games\, but it gave me a bad feeling.- Old games were very bloody. Now you kill enemies that bleed fire or ice instead of blood. I miss more throats cutted and heads smashed.- Valkyries are one of the best things in this game. Why don't include them in main story? No\, they are post-game content and they lose interest because of that.It's a very good game\, but next game of the franchise must have more boss battles\, most epic moments\, more improvement of the realms we visit and a better story.This one is 8/10.… Expand"

Story is fantastic and I am honestly looking forward to the next installments.The chest finding and puzzle solving side of the game is good but some of them get so laborious that I ended up leaving them behind or consulting YouTube.Anyway\, the main problem with this game for me is the combat system. It is quite bad at least for me. The camera sits too close behind you that you have no idea what's happening around you. This was a huge difference from previous god of war games that made the combat worse in my opinion. The enemies are just as many and just as active (if not more) as previous God of War games but you have no view of what's happening around you\, which handicaps you.To add to that now blocking does not block attacks from behind you which has always been the case throughout GoW games. This makes that game a painful chore of hitting a enemy twice and them evading hoping no one is going to hit you. Completing a combo is a rare blessing in this game\, something that made me fall in love with GoW games.To add to all this there are way more unblockable attacks and block breakers in this game that previous games which makes it even more frustrating. Some of the fights are literally throwing an axe and recalling a few times or swinging a few hits then dodging for 10 sec or so and rinse and repeat.And the worst part is\, sometimes the evading system doesn't even save you. I would be actively evading (not trying to fight just evading) and some of them enemy attacks would still hit me\, especially the ware-wolves and to a lesser extent the travelers.All in all the combat has been made a lot harder and lot less focused on fun. I remember when playing God of war 1 and 3 I could just sit there holding block waiting for the right moment to attach\, I felt powerful and in charge but not in this game.But game does get more fun later.And I would recommend it to play at least once.… Expand"

The character development starts with how much of a struggle it is for Kratos to not only teach his son how to be strong and able to survive\, but also to bond. If you know Kratos\, he isn't the most sympathetic individual. However\, with them trying to start their journey\, Odin takes note of there being an unfamiliar presence in their world. This of course complicates the journey that Kratos and his son is needing to complete.Graphics: The graphics on this game are absolutely phenomenal. It uses the fantastic technique of what Half Life used\, with everything being one shot. Also\, the lighting\, level of detail of the world\, and the characters is next level\, that I could not picture the PS4/Pro to handle.Game play: For me\, this is on the same level as the story. None of the combat ever feels dull or boring. Each enemy shines in there own way and provides different scenarios on how the player is forced to defeat the foe. Not only that\, but the enemies are at different levels and difficulty of the type\, and they can be mixed in with weaker enemies\, so it forces you to be careful at how you play. The RPG elements of the game is on point. Better than the more recent RPG's on leveling up and really lets you customize Kratos and Atreus on how you want them to be. More aggressive? More defensive? Want a perfect balance? You have the power to make it however you need it to be. The fighting and leveling up on the characters are so in depth\, that it takes you by surprise that this is coming from a single player game.Overall thoughts: I played God of War on the PS4 Pro\, with resolution mode. I did it\, because I wanted to really see if the system can handle it\, and if not\, I could easily swap it over to performance. Through the whole main story\, I did experience a few frame drops. BUT\, I never felt like I had to take it off the resolution mode. It happened so quick\, that it never bothered me and not effect any gameplay in any way. The reason why I mention this\, is because I have seen a lot of flack. But on resolution mode is a great way to experience this game\, if you prefer that over frame rate. I will try out performance mode once I replay the game\, to just have higher framerate\, but I did not want to use on the first run since it wasn't locked and I wanted to limit stutter as much as possible. This game does an amazing job at telling a story\, letting you get pumped\, excited\, worried and overall attached to the characters\, and that has never been the case with previous God of Wars. This was  a step in the right direction\, and unique in its own way\, and I highly encourage you to try out the highest rated game on the PS4\, so far.… Expand"

The new God of War marks a new era in the series thirteen year old history\, with an amazing heartfelt story\, new characters and places to explore\, and an older\, calmer Kratos with so many more adventures to have. A new beginning was announced in 2016\, and it has arrived with a bang that can be feltEasily one of the best games on the PS4 and easily one of the best games of this generation. The new God of War marks a new era in the series thirteen year old history\, with an amazing heartfelt story\, new characters and places to explore\, and an older\, calmer Kratos with so many more adventures to have. A new beginning was announced in 2016\, and it has arrived with a bang that can be felt throughout the Nine Realms.Let's start with the setting. This is something the series had always excelled in\, whether we were visiting ancient portrayals of Athens\, Sparta\, or Rhodes\, or the fantastical locations of Mount Olympus and the Underworld\, God of War has always wowed with it's visuals. This tradition continues in Midgard\, a wild\, mostly untamed land full of lush woods\, snowy mountains\, deep caves\, and goes even further with it's additional realms of Alfheim\, Helheim and more. The world itself feels massive and just about everything you see\, you can go to. The characters themselves all look incredibly life like. Kratos looks less stylized and more human\, which certainly fits the theme of the game. The Norse gods themselves may not look as grandiose as their Greek counterparts\, but their style and design fits the new aesthetics perfectly. I played this game on a launch PS4 and it still looked incredible\, but I also got to play it on a Pro with a 4K television and level of detail reaches a phenomenal quality. If you can play this game in 4K. do it!Combat has changed considerably from previous titles. God of War was always a hack n' slash style of game\, but by Ascension that had slowly started to wear thin. This new Dark Souls-inspired combat is a refreshing take and lends itself really well to the over-the-shoulder camera angle this new entry adopts. Combat flows smoothly and feels methodical and purposeful\, and the Leviathan ax will surely satisfy anyone missing the iconic chain blades Kratos has become known for\, and recalling the ax once it is thrown never EVER gets old. Atreus also lends himself really well to combat. He is there to support you\, whether it's by shooting arrows to distract enemies at your command\, choking them with his bow to provide you with an opening to unleash vicious combos\, or by alerting you to enemies trying to flank you. He never gets in the way\, and never feels like a nuisance or a burden\, thanks to a very competent A.I..  Enemy types have many different variations and you will need to adapt your strategy accordingly. For instance\, Hel-Reavers are immune to the Leviathan ax\, so using your fists and shield will be the best way to take them out\, and Revenants will dodge any attack unless stunned by one of Atreus' arrows first. Learning and upgrading new skills and attacks will also come into a play a bit. Runic attacks can change the flow of battle in an instant and can be tailored to how you want to fight. I chose an ice beam attack that froze my enemies on contact to slow them down and frozen slam attack for crowd control. It is also crucial to upgrade your gear. Enemies get progressively tougher as the game opens up and fortunately\, the dwarves Brok and sindri are their to craft you new gear pieces\, and upgrade any you find on the road. The crafting system itself takes some getting used to\, but once you gotten over this hurdle it becomes a cake walk. Also\, early game\, put a bit of focus on the Luck stat\, trust me.Now onto the story. The God of War series has always told serviceable stories\, but never anything of this caliber. The previous games were all violent rage-fueled power fantasies using Greek mythology as a backdrop(not knocking on this because it actually DID work). This game\, however\, takes a more intimate approach with its characters. The story is no longer about a man hacking his way through a pantheon of gods\, it is about a father and a son that don't really understand one another yet must reconcile their differences in order to survive the journey ahead. The main focus of the plot is actually a simple one: Kratos and Atreus are trying to deliver Faye's(Kratos wife/Atreus' mother) ashes to the highest peak in the realms. However\, the world itself gets in the way. The two must learn to work together to honor Faye's last wish and watching this man that for over ten years was nothing but rage\, show such heartwarming emotions for another person tugged at my heartstrings every time.The plot also opens up the series for some amazing feats going forward and if he ending is any indication\, we in are for even greater more memorable adventures in the future.Overall\, God of War was the game I looked forward to the most since it was announced back in 2016\, and I have not been disappointed. It's quickly jumped into the list of my favorite games of all time and is an easy contender for Game of the Year. Spider-Man and Red Dead Redemption 2 will certainly give it a run for it's money\, but God of War is a game worthy of recognition and one that everyone should experience.… Expand"

Gameplay2. Story3. ReplayabilityGameplay:The gameplay in GOW has always been quite simple\, but it was always made interesting by the flashy moves and combos you could pull off. This games combat is basically Dark Souls\, with shoulder attack buttons??? I'm a huge fan of DS don't get me wrong but every single game doesn't have to base itself around that sort of combat system\, it's getting kind of old now. Enemies are complete bullet sponges\, with extremely frustrating AI\, this is even worse when you factor these in in the AWFUL boss battles in this game. There are 3 original Boss battles in this game\, Baldur\, Magni and Modi\, and the Dragon. Don't you dare call those stupid trolls they used like 30 times a boss. They knew the trolls weren't hard so they constantly put in 20 enemies with it at the same time. This is not making your combat system shine\, SMS\, it's making it show it's flaws. The camera can't fight five people at a time\, they tried to remedy this by adding these red arrows to tell you when to dodge\, but this makes it so you're looking more at that then at the screen itself to know when to dodge. And don't even get me started on the RPG elements\, you're telling me Kratos\, the god that killed the entire Greek Pantheon cannot kill a simple draugr if he doesn't have a bit more armor???? Wtf is this? Definitely the worst part of the gameplay as this leads to constant farming for better gear\, again\, FARMING IN A GOW GAME. I don't mind doing a lot of quests for EXP and gaining new perks and abilities\, but not like that. They're blocking satisfying fights and stuff behind grinding\, such a shame. All in all the combat gets pretty stale and repetitive so be warned. The graphics and environments look amazing but are underused because you spend most of your time inside\, real shame.Story:This story\, is so\, goddamn boring. Let me explain\, the goal of Kratos and his son is to carry Faye's ashes to the highest peak in all the nine realms. This in itself is already not the most interesting thing\, perhaps the story will expand once you get started right? No\, it doesn't. You don't even have emotional attachment to Faye's character because you never get to know her\, you just start the game and she's dead\, so how am I supposed to feel attached to this journey that's so 'important' to Kratos and Atreus while we basically don't know and don't give a **** about Faye. I see a lot of people praising this game for it's 'mature' look on GOW like wow so deep. All this constant talking (not only between Kratos and Atreus) makes this **** a walking simulator\, forced walking segments with stupid dialogue between these characters. Is this what makes a game mature these days? Walking segments with expository dialogue? No this isn't interesting or deep it's straight up boring when this is what you do during 50% of the games story. Let's talk about the main focus of it all\, Kratos and his son. I can see why a lot of people like it\, and I respect that\, but hear my side of the story. I thought Atreus' addition was a missed opportunity. It made Kratos look more like a **** then his older self. Atreus is not endearing nor cute nor fun nor boy nor nothing! He pissed me off more then anything in this game. He made me want to quit halfway through the story because of **** character. A huge sigh came out of my mouth every time he did something\, I didn't find it fun to babysit this kid for the whole game\, it just didn't do it for me. But I can see why some people do like him and get invested in him. What I did like in this story was Mimir\, thank god that guy was there or I wouldn't have finished this game. As for Baldur\, he was pretty interesting at first but became more of a nuisance later\, mainly because the boss fight plays out the exact same every time you fight him\, oh yeah after that it goes all DMC and he gets color coded so you can only damage him with the Leviathan Axe or Chaos Blades\, so dumb. I could rant on and on about the story but i'll keep it to this.Replayability:This game has no second value\, once you get through the main story\, that's it. Of course you could replay the game on higher difficulty like GMGOW\, but this is not a fun or challenging difficulty\, it's basically 'enemies have 30k health and if you mess up once you're dead'. Side missions are uninteresting and you get jack **** for doing them. And the Valkyries are locked behind grind walls. Good luck killing them too 'cause their boss fight are totally fair. And before you say anything I beat Sigrun.My final verdict is a 4/10This game got hyped up so much and is overrated as hell\, very disappointed by how it turned out\, but I guess it's only €20 now so it's ok.… Expand"

One thing I think weakens it is that there are practically no characters. You meet less than 10 people. Many of the people you do meet are pretty paste-board thin archetypes in terms of story and development. \""RAH\, I'm a bad guy\, I don't like you!\"" \""Hey\, we're the bad guy's two friends and we don't like you either!\"" You don't even see the characters who are painted as your main antagonists/big bads. You start the game grieving for someone you never meet and therefore I never felt I could connect with that grief. Although the graphics are great\, I think your son\, Atreus\, looks like he crawled out of the uncanny valley or like he smells something bad all the time. I found the game's ending to be massively underwhelming. It should have been an epic climax\, but it felt unfinished. It was very deliberate in trying to set up sequels. It was suspiciously like putting up billboards to buy the next game so you can see what happens next!I enjoyed it a lot for the majority of my playthrough.

Acquiring resources is kind of important\, at least to get your weapons to level 5-6 for the ending. Playing on easy will get your skills a bit too soon. The travel warp mechanic is one way for most of the game and it's really annoying. I think it was put there so you follow a certain path to the story or prevent bugs ?? Fighting is the same except with the son archery and they removed the quicktime boss fighting. I would advise that you upgrade the attack ability of the son faster in general\, and learn to get the best of him. I like the mechanic that separate a task between father and son. I enjoyed all the stories that were told in the boat. The main transport are by boat and foot. Warping isn't very helpful until very late into the game. Amazing graphics.

If you are here to hear a great tale set in the world of Norse Mithology - you are not going to be disappointed.There is always a \""but\"" in the review that starts like that and it is no different here. The world itself feels empty. There are only 9 characters in the game aside from enemies and unnamed ghosts with side missions. We are visiting 6 realms\, we are seeing villages but it all empty. Sure - it is explained - but still I ended up with feeling that the world is empty.Going back to narrative - I love how Kratos\, Atreus and Mimir are interacting with each other during the whole game (even after beating main story). You can hear a lot of great stories during exploration.The combat mechanics are solid. Deep and satysfying. Hard enough to engage but not too hard. I liked how after beating the story I started to care about my gear and crafting resources. It shows how though through the whole system is.The combat is a little too brutal for my taste (especially finisher animations) but that just me.One thing that was suprisingly good was Atreus as a fight companion.

Not a single average\, let alone negative \""critic\"" review\, despite this games many shortcomings. Now this game looks amazing\, the graphics and the area design are stunning. Sadly it's almost entirely inaccessible as a player\, you're stuck to very limited pathways and funneled towards enemy areas where you fight the same few generic enemies and eventually a boss..and besides a few collectables and bits of story\, that's about it\, it's just repeating the same thing over and over\, whilst surrounded by beautiful scenery that you can't explore at all\, which makes the game feel like it's several generations old...oh hold on\, you can smash pots...yep a game made in this era and we're still smashing pots. Then there's Kratos as a character\, Firstly he's a demigod who apparently can't jump...Absolutely ridiculous. Now there are other great games where the main character or characters can't jump\, but the gameplay design of those games is done so well that you don't really notice. In God Of War it VERY noticeable! The lack of a jump mechanic along with the very linear gameplay just take away any feeling of power from the character\, which in a God Of War game is ludicrous. Climbing is another poor bit of game design. Kratos is only able to climb areas very clearly marked with paint\, and he has to climb down the same way. At one point i climbed a small ledge to smash some pots (great fun...) and i had to backtrack to the painted climbing area to get down. it was a 4ft high ledge and Kratos couldn't just hop down..Again\, a demigod who can't jump down from a 4ft high ledge...The main issue with all this games limitations is that they take away any feeling of immersion\, and again make the gameplay feel incredibly dated. Kratos controls like a character from a generation of gaming that controlled in that way only due to the technical limitations of the time. I could go into the annoying father son story ( Akin to having to listen to your breeder friends who do nothing but bang on about they're effing kids because they assume you care as much as they do) and the fact that you have an irritating side kick to have to think about whilst playing. Atreus adds nothing to the gameplay is frankly just annoying..just like people who won't shut up about they're f!*king kids.In general this game is just incredibly underwhelming. It's a beautiful looking game that is let down by very dated\, linear game design.… Expand"

I switched screens to a very cheap screen I have in my house and instantly won impossible battles since the 50 fps 720p screen allowed smooth action ) \,Another thing is that the game overheat my ps4 so that he fan becomes load as an airplan and the game doesn't look that good\, I have better looking games that has zero effect of overheating (batman\, resident evil 4/5 revolation 2 which look fantastic)The dodge is trash = The game is grid based meanning you are fighting on little squars and dodge is so tight it sometimes roll and instead of moving you 2-3 mini squars\, it doesnt move you at all\, meanning after the roll you will die from one hit again and again and again sometimes the roll didn't even give me invulnerable frames and not because I rolled into something\, but because the game failed to register my movement.The combat is not functioning hence the score zero out of 10Now lets talk about the storyThis is copy past the last of us\, the creators of this game didn't even want to call Cratos as Cratos\, he was meant to have the name Stig and be a whole other person\, this game just simply use Cratos as a skin\, this is not Cratos\, Cratos is a villain\,  a hardcore killer\, he is a scambag\, a bad guy. Cratos does what he does because rage consume him to the point that once he couldnt recognize his family\, he is a deep well writen humanoid character that has anger issues. The new cratos is a Stig that is now nammed Cratos\, he is a carring loving father that is monotone\, never get angry\, never get passionate about killing\, just a survivor. Boring guy that has nothing to do with the original Cratos.His son is very very boring too\, acting like eliie from the last of us by killing someone then being sad about it\, screaming constantly in fights\, say \""whatever\"" a million times\, he is boring\, pointless\, I hated every moment I had him on screen\, even his fighting style was boring to watch\, he has literaly \""son button\"" (go ahead\, watch it in the menu that is literaly how the square botton is named) and this is nothing but watching a timer goes down 3 seconds\, 2 seconds\, 1 second\, can shoot another arrow now. And the arrow has low hit rate\, this kid is always missing\, when I need him to hit an enemy that tries to level up I have to aim the camera so that he knows which enemy I want him to hit\, then press square and 90% the times he would miss even though I really need him to hit that arrow to avoid a major battle shift by having enemies leveling up.This kid is boring\, useless\, constantly screaming\, having a personality of a robot saying whatever every single minute. I didn't feel like I want him arround at all.There are no intresting enemies only trolls and a few dudes with no creativity in how they look or behave\, there is no passionate delivery of lines such as when Cratos used to stand his ground telling all the gods he will stop at nothing untill he have his revange\, there is no jump button\, everything is context sensitive\, where in the other games you can and will die during cut scenes\, in this game\, cutscenes are there to hide the loading screen time\, so you are never in danger\, lots of talking paths where you are not a allowed to run\, with climing which you cant die in which is basicly even more talking sections\, the game is more of a movie than a game\, you cannot skip cutscenes whatsoever\, there is no replay value\, The game doesnt worth the half asking price\, the game doesn't worth a single dollar.This is pure trash.… Expand"

You deal miserable damage and have to keep clicking and clicking and clicking one or two buttons till that bastard is dead and you can move on to the next one until they stop freaking respawning. Guess it doesn't come as a suprise that you die in 3-4 blows. Bosses take a ton of clicking before they go down of course. Camera is pretty bad too. It can't properly autolock targets even when autolock is on\, it can't show who's attacking you from behind with \""autolock = on\"" until you rotate the camera manually\, sometimes it fails to lock-switch to next target after you killed the current one. Jeez\, i started God of War after i finished Vampyr (yeah\, the one from Dontnod who previously made an adventure about school girls) and you know what?

Come on here and be honest after playing the game and give it a game review not a system review. This game is a great deal of fun and looks great I like the new changes. I am a huge tomb raider fan and this is nothing like that game so that’s a lie. This is more of a technical hack and slash while Tomb is not. The changes to the controls make this game less of a button masher and more of a thinker. You have to be more careful with how and who you attack while using your son to distract and kill. I will say so far the story feels a little diffrent from the past games but the situation is different so that makes sense. Also just because it’s a father and a son fighting together to reach a place does not make it a last of us clone. As a matter of fact that’s all these two games have in common and that’s not even the same. To sum up a lot of you ppl simply need to grow up I’m sick of seeing gamers giving games lower or higher scores trying to level out the overall score and system hating. You have no power you have no control and let’s be honest If you think giving a game you love a 5 to level the overall score is some noble self sacrifice your wrong it’s just stupid.… Expand"

I don't intend to finish collecting collectibles or quests\, nor play a new game + if this is added later as in the end\, i wasn't having any more fun with the game and wanted to see the ending.Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons :Pros :- The game is beautiful and the animations are top notch- The story is good and there's a lot of lore- The different worlds are interesting- There was very some cool moments but sadly they are dilluted in the rest- There was some clever puzzles- Mimir is a very cool sidekickCons- VERY Slow paced. Sometime i was even fighting to not fall asleep while playing in the evening.- The combat/gameplay are \""just ok\"". They tried to be more like dark souls but failed. In the other god of war\, the combat was the main attraction while in this one\, it's sometimes feels like a chore.- There's only a handful of ennemy types and most of them are not memorable (red zombie\, blue zombie\, green zombie...).- The ending is very underwhelming. It gives materials for future games but leave this one feeling empty.- The bosses are overused. You fight the same re-skinned troll about 6 times.- They tried to hide the loadings behind very long slow animations or a world between worlds when you warp around. This somehow contributes to the slow paces of the game. I would probably have prefered a 30s loading screen instead of a 10 seconds animations\, followed by 30 sec of wandering around in a world\, followed by another animation.- Most dialogues could be resumed by Kratos telling his son to shut up and focusIn summary\, this is god-of-war-themed\, but this is definitively not a god of war game. This game is worth playing but is a bit overrated and definitively not the best game on PS4\, even less of all time. In my mind\, God of war 2 is still the best and 3 is not far behind.… Expand"

After Kratos's 8 to 5 year hiatus\, (Depending on what you would count as the last main entry) He's returned once again to show these latest Sony wanna-be mascots up\, I'm talking about you Aloy and Delsin Rowe. This newest entry separates itself from past entries in the franchise\, while the original games where all hack-and-slash\, this new game attempts for a close\, over the shoulder point of view which is a new perspective\, which Santa Monica Studios has refined to a charm. The new style and take on the combat system is welcomed quite easily\, for both veterans and newcomers. While it does retain a few elements we've seen prior in the God of War series such as combos\, the combat itself requires a bit more of a strategical in higher difficulties. I personally recommend that you first play this game on \""Give Me a Challenge\"" as the name implies\, it gives the combat a more emphasize on strategy and being quick on your feet. Now\, another element of the gameplay you'll see is the newfound is the new emphasis of exploration and straying of the beaten path. It'd be almost impossible to not at one point not further the story\, and assist one of the many side characters with a mutual understanding that helping others helps you in the long run\, as a matter a fact\, the game at one point dwells on this between banter of Kratos and his son\, Atreus. When Atreus asks his father why he won't help people out of kindness\, and Kratos responds with it doesn't help them during their journey\, and while he is right at that moment\, it isn't much harder to look at the fact that you controlling Kratos know that you'll be rewarded for your progress in helping the many NPC's you'll meet. Now\, while as of now\, I've finally finished the game\, and am writing this review\, as shall say that the story left me wanting a bit more at the end\, saying to myself\, \""Wait... That was the end?\"" If you ask me\, God of War 2017 leaves the door open for Santa Monica Studios to craft a sequel to this perfect game.

For others its kind of bland. And we are all right. The story will be up to the player and their emotions to decide if its great or not. But we should all be able to agree that the story telling(presentation) is also top notch.The game play is where this game really shines. The combat is frantic and fluid. It requires you to use your brain and not just your fingers as it is difficult. I can definitely see how some feel it is too tough and might blame this on game design. Not true. They have let their fustration get the best of them. STICK THROUGH IT. You might feel like giving up. Don't. Trust me you will be robbing yourself of an epic experience.This game feels right and as a long time GoW fanatic i didn't know how to feel about the changes but after playing i can say that this was the right direction for a series that felt a little blah after ascension.

The story has twists and turns which never stop amazing.As a person who knew virtually nothing about the God of War series\, the game explained as much as it could without feeling like a typical \""reboot\"". I found myself wanting to learn as much as I could about the universe\, exploring every nook and cranny for information\, clues\, and secrets.The combat is great. At first\, it feels like you are overpowered. A huge guy just smashing through enemies\, but then it gets harder\, grittier\, intense. You are forced to stop running head on and actually take things a little slower\, use the environment and your son to get the tactical edge. But\, there are also points where you can take a left turn instead of a right\, and find yourself facing an enemy that's extremely overpowered and one-hit kills you\, which leaves you stunned.My only issue with the game is that it leaves a lot of things unanswered. I found myself googling how to reach other \""islands\""\, only to find out there is no way of getting to them. But let's be honest here\, we aren't going to complain if they release a God of War II.(PS.

The biggest let down however was the ending\, which felt abrupt and anti-climactic. There a lot to do and collect in this game however after the end of the disappointing story I didn't feel compelled to complete it 100%. There is also a lack of interesting boss battles and a lack of variety in enemies and finishers which became boring to see very quickly unlike Doom 2016. A lot of the gear upgrades seem worthless or not useful and some of the move upgrades are  unnecessary. Overall I had a good time playing God of War\, it's far from the masterpiece that gaming sites have made it out to be\, it's close but ultimately misses the mark; there are some great moments and some dull moments however it feels like half a story and hopefully it has a satisfying conclusion in the sequel.… Expand"

81817,GOW2018,2018-10-01,10,"First off\, I wish the main story was longer. It was a bit shorter than I expected and was kind of disappointed in that aspect. Nonetheless the game is definitely a must play. I felt as if they were trying to give us a Joel and Ellie relationship\, with Kratos and Atreus\, and this made me raise a few questions about the game. At some points of the game\, I was confused with what the developers decided to do with the story\, like when you are trying to reach the light in Alfheim and an Elf Jumps out of the wall at you. If that was supposed to make the player shocked of some kind\, then it failed miserably at it\, as when it jumped out\, I immediately said \""Kratos is a God\, so this is nothing\"". The game tries to make Kratos seem more humane\, but honestly we still remember the angry spartan. When taking on bigger enemies\, I again was confused at how difficult it seemed to take these enemies down\, as in previous games\, I understand that he is older\, but he is still a God. Like the dragon fight should've been way better and should've been as gruesome as previous games' boss fights. One more thing that I have a problem with is that the Kratos and Atreus relationship felt forced and unsatisfying when I finished the game.With all of the negatives out the way\, the game does what it wants to correctly. The combat is more enjoyable than I thought it would be and the fact that it is open world really immersed me into the game. I love that there is so much to do after the main game is completed and that the game gives a challenge in a lot of aspects. The story despite all the flaws was still good\, but not the best. Sometimes I felt for these characters and actually felt as if the stakes were high. This really fits the game and makes it a much more enjoyable experience.Pros-The story is immersive and has good story telling-There is much to do when completing the game-The combat is better than it may seem-Open world is done properly and doesn't feel emptyCons-The relationship between Kratos and Atreus feels forced-The boss fights aren't that great… Expand"

Combined with the unique camera work and stellar direction\, God of War comfortably rests in the highest possible echelons of cinematic storytelling in video games along with The Last of Us and Uncharted 4.- Engrossing take on Norse mythology as well as the God of War mythos.  The story is more than strong enough to keep you engaged and I would guess that it will likely be the primary impetus for most people that play this game.  Although there are issues with a few of the character arcs\, God of War manages to overall maintain a consistently stellar level of quality throughout its plot\, characters\, and writing.- The Leviathan Axe is a highly versatile weapon due to its melee and ranged capabilities and the game very much pushes you to utilize its full capabilities at the higher difficulty sessions.  In particular\, the Mjolnir-like weapon recall system remains fun throughout the entire ~35 hour journey.- The visual and audio effects very much sell the impact and weightiness of the attacks in this game - making the combat feel much more visceral and satisfying.Cons:- XP and gold start to feel useless in the last ~25% of the game  - which makes progression feel static in the post game.  Enchantments do not have much tangible effect on overall gameplay besides from pure numbers and it's thus disappointing that this is the only part of your kit worth adjusting in the later sections of this title.- Repetitiveness is definitely an issue here when it comes to the gameplay.  Although the game does have a wealth of interesting ideas\, the low number of enemy types (or at least the ways in which you combat them) and dearth of unique boss encounters can start to make the combat arenas tiring.  Furthermore\, the long distances between objectives and the relatively slow travel speed of Kratos can make the game feel frustratingly draggy at times.- The climbing in this game is perhaps the worse I have seen in a AAA title.  There is absolutely no freedom or player agency in these sections\, even compared to games such as Uncharted or Tomb Raider.  The sluggishness of Kratos's movements and the linearity at which you move through these areas makes it a complete bore.- The camera is great from a storytelling perspective\, but it unnecessarily forces the gameplay to suffer.  Although the designers ended up mostly succeeding in making the close camera work\, I can't help but feel as if a more traditional fixed/controllable camera would have helped the fluidity of combat.  Kratos should not feel so vulnerable - he should feel like a god.Final Word:Production and direction are at the zenith in this game in a fashion that is rarely seen.  God of War is undoubtedly on top of the world right now and that is due to the massive budget and care that was clearly imbued into every aspect of the game's presentation.

That being said - I did not really find the main characters very likeable nor was I really all that invested in what happened to them.

The two character approach to combat was a really good idea but the execution was a bit lacking and I basically ended up just mashing the arrow button a lot without having much impact in tough battles.  The game does seem to borrow from Dark Souls but the combat just doesn't have as much depth.  The Valkyrie battles were great though.  As others pointed out the enemies get very repetitive and I kind of rushed through the end.The optional combat trial realms I did not find fun at all.  I gave each of those maybe a half an hour of play time and then just left them for good.  Some of those trials are extremely tedious and you are just fighting the same enemies as usual.The graphics and immersion are where the game really shines.  The environments and level design tied to the main story line were fantastic and I wanted more of that.… Expand

Don't get me wrong\, I enjoyed the combat (I played the game on the second highest difficulty\, which I found rather challenging\, but fun)\, but the way the lock-on system works is somewhat a mess. Luckily\, it's up to each individual player to decide how often they want to use the lock-on\, which I only did when in 1v1 combat\, because then it worked fine.

I mean\, I guess they were fun but I could never really commit to them.  So when I saw the game was changing perspective both visually and in the narrative I was very intrigued and after playing the game all weekend\, I feel I can make a fairly sound judgement on the quality of the game.As I start to write I am having a hard time deciding where to start.  Do I like the graphics?  Yes.  Do I like the story? Very much.  Do I like the combat?  Yes\, yes I do.  Exploring\, levelling and character design\, crafting\, side questing?  Yes! Yes! YES!  It is hard to find one part of the game that is better than any other.  I guess what it is about this game that makes it so special is that one very desired but every elusive concept in video games\, Balance.  Cory Barlog and Santa Monica Studios have done what so many developers strive to do\, create a game where all the systems integrate so well you never struggle to understand what you need to do and at the same time\, does not feel like the game is holding your hand.  One of my favourite way the game has done this is near the beginning of the game.  Just after the player opens the map for the first time\, Kratos and Atrius' dialogue suggests that since the map has more to see maybe we should go see whats on the map.  I like this because not only did the conversation sound natural between these characters\, but because it hinted at how the game can be played.I like a lot of different games for many different reasons.  God of War I love because there is not any one reason to love it.  The vision that Cory and his team had for this game feel like it is complete.  Nothing was left out or added for no reason\, everything carries weight\, everything is in Ballance.Final Note:  Hey Santa Monica studios\, early 3D Legend of Zelda called\, they want their design back.....not exactly but Dare to Compare....lol...BALANCE!!!!… Expand"

With a new mythology\, new gods to defeat and a new way of combat\, can this reimagining of the old PS2 franchise bring new life to this series? Let’s see as we delve into what does and does not work with God of War (2018).Story: The story starts with Kratos and his new son\, Atreus morning over the loss of Kratos Wife and Atreus mother. Her last wish is to have her ashes spread on the highest peak in the land of Midgard. While getting ready to go on this mission\, a stranger\, knowing of Kratos past\, tries to stop them for unknown reasons. I won’t say anymore due to spoilers but it’s an amazing story. The new calm and collective Kratos dealing with what he did in the past makes for a more relatable Kratos and helps the story stay intriguing. The references to the previous games are enough for long-time fans to piece together what happened between this game and the 3rd installment but subtle enough for newbies to the franchise not to get lost\, hence why this game is only called God of War\, The father and son relationship is perfect and is the driving force behind this amazing journey. If you’re getting this game for the story\, it’s easily one of the best parts of this game.Gameplay: The gameplay is just as brutal as the previous games but it has changed in many ways. The camera is now in a locked position and gives a more cinematic look for story moments and for combat. It’s very similar to what they do in Naughty Dog’s more recent entries. The fast-paced combat from previous entries is replaced for a weightier and slow-moving combat. This makes combat way more brutal\, thanks with the help of Kratos new weapon\, The Leviathan Axe. This new style is also mixed in with light RPG elements and a semi-open world\, even though the game is still mostly linear. The RPG elements work well but I feel like they were unnecessary\, with the exception of the skill tree. Crafting armor and dealing with different stats feels pointless. Last but not least\, the enemies are great when they are not repetitive. I started to get annoyed towards the end when I started to fight a boss gauntlet of enemies I had fought many times before. Luckily\, this does not start feeling like a problem till close to the end. Overall\, the gameplay is fantastic as well. Just need a bit more variety in the enemies next time around.Technical: This game is the best looking game of PS4\, hands down\, even if you only own a regular PS4. No framerate drop and no load screens (Unless you die). The game is present in one singular shot from beginning to end and it makes the game more impressive due to it. The soundtrack is amazing\, such a powerful score that never lets up from beginning to end. No glitches of any kind. This game\, like most PlayStation titles as of late\, is a technical masterpiece.Verdict: God of War (2018) is a promising start to a reimagining of a classic IP. A risk I don’t think anyone would take with an established IP. Having the courage to get an IP that everyone knows and turn it into something so different is just unheard of in this day in age. I applaud everyone over at Santa Monica Studio for make a near perfect experience. Just try to make enemies a bit more varied near the end next time.Pros:+Amazing Journey+New Brutal Gameplay+Powerful Soundtrack+Technical MasterpieceCons:-No enemy variety near the end… Expand"

I would also like to state that I am rating this game as an experienced God of War series player and because of that I had some kind of different expectations towards it. People who are new to the series would not have this problem and therefore rate this game higher.To me God of War 3: Remastered was a masterpiece. What I really loved beyond comprehension is:1) Kratos. In previous games were a very big\, very angry and brutal warrior\, a god killer and you knew that everyone who steps in your path is going to get their asses whooped one way or another and usually it was going to be BRUTAL. You felt powerful\, strong\, a rage in its purest form and this game failed to deliver the same experience. You now have a kid\, you now have to be smart\, responsible\, control yourself and share your philosophical insights.2) While playing previous games you always had this sense of greatness: you fought titans\, you walked on titans\, you fought gods\, you brought them to their knees over and over again. You also met many different enemies\, many different execution scenes and so on. God of War 2018 went really south with this section: boring recolors\, low amount of enemy types\, only few god fights and those gods look... Well\, disappointing at best. No more \""look\, I am on a guy as high as the Empire State Building\"".3) The constantly changing environment. God of War 3 had this \""I am in a completely different place now\"" feeling: you ran from fire on bridges getting broken\, you ran on titans\, you traveled on flying stones having to defend them\, you shot canons at titans - the list goes on. There was always something new\, dynamic and unexpected. This new game fails here bad: no more jumping\, same environment (except the realms which won't really matter until you beat the game) \, same boat\, same water\, same snow - that i it.Those three points really had a big impact on my experience while playing the game: its just not that god of war I used to play earlier and its not better in those specific aspects I've mentioned above.The graphics are great\, the music is great\, voice acting is great\, the story is kind of good\, but not really memorable. The fighting changes are also pretty decent according to me (except for the fact that you will have to suffer that camera pain since you never see who\, how and when is going to attack you from behind except for red arrow indicator).This is why I can not give this game more than 8 - its just not that powerful and breathtaking God of War that it used to be.… Expand"

I would be using my fists the majority of the first half of the game since I forgot the axe was on the ground. They should have had an alternate switch for the axe to boomerang automatically at all times.Mature level was toned down in parts. We got cutaways during the gruesome moments. Red blood is uncommon but can be brutal. Just no where near as violent of GOW3\, which had Mortal Kombat levels of gore. The funny mini games where you take girls to bed are no longer in this game either.Upgrading was very overwhelming. Before in past games it was a chore to spend time in menues that made users choose on what skills to improve. They take it to new levels because you got to choose on gear for each section of your body and your son. We need games to stay away from menues as much as possible.Story had a gap since a major part was never addressed between 2 characters and their relationship with one another.Only had a few boss battles. Not as many as past games. They are spread out at random times instead of at the end of each level.Norse setting was a bit less exciting than Greek Mythology\, but guess they didn't have many options. Who knows\, maybe the bible or Love Craftian trilogies will come for the ps5.Pros.Graphics where out of control. Very detailed\, colorful. Took full advantage of pro using upscaled 4K. Environments were spread out and had a good mix of places to visit around each world.Combat was nice since it felt like Dark Souls meets Devil May Cry. Also cool that your son is always around to help stun enemies.Puzzles where fairly tricky which helped mix up action to a nice pace.Was reasonably long and challenging over all.Story was well written and had characters that made you care about them. Some awesome plot twists were revealed later near the end that will be neat to anyone wanting surprises.… Expand"

82003,GOW2018,2018-05-24,7,"Here's a list of things I didn't like about the game I posted on a YouTube video comment section:1) *Character movement:* OK\, I get it\, each game is different and you should get used to the mechanics. Still\, I hate that Kratos never turns to the direction of the analog. He walks sideways\, he walks backwards\, he does all sorts of weird stuff except the most intuitive. I hate to actually press a specific button to do a quick turn. What is the sense in that? I know GoW is not the only game that does this\, but I hate whenever a developer chooses this path.2) *Character speed:* The quests can get repetitive after a while and I would like to cover more ground more quickly\, but I can't. There's no option for running or sprinting. Climbing chains and debris is a real nuisance\, I felt like dying from boredom. Especially when you have to cover the same area multiple times. It could learn from Uncharted.3) *Shift rolling for sidestepping:* Again\, GoW is not the first or only game to do that\, but I hate when the mechanics change from rolling to quick-stepping when you have your lock on. It makes dodging projectiles impossible. So you have to unlock\, dodge\, lock again. And in the heat of a fight it's rarely that easy. And again\, it's the kind of thing I don't see the purpose of. Bloodborne is also like that.4) *Locking:* Usually locking will help you keep your aim at a specific target. And while it helps with melee\, whenever you have to throw your axe or Atreus' arrows it does absolutely nothing to help you.5) *Can't quit a fight:* Sometimes you'll encounter an enemy much stronger than you\, but you don't have the option to flee\, only to fight or resign to a quick death and avoid the area next time. I understand when it's a boss fight\, or a mandatory fight to progress through the main quest\, but when it's an optional fight - like those floating bubbles - it makes no sense. The Witcher also sins from that.6) *Forced perspective:* Sometimes the camera will stuck in an angle and you can't move it. God only knows why. It feels the studio was more concerned with the cinematic experience rather than with the gameplay experience. Uncharted also does that\, especially the ps3 installments.7) *Less QTE\, please:* I know the whole franchise (and Santa Monica Studio for that matter - who remembers The Order 1886?) is famous for the use of QTE. Ditch it already. I'm playing a game\, not an interactive movie.8) *Story: (SPOILERS)* I appreciated the twists in the Norse mythology\, and if you're a fan like myself\, you'll notice and appreciate the variations in Mimir tales. To be honest\, when I was a kid reading the prose Edda\, I always thought the Aesir gods were kinda jerks. Still\, I'm divided about making them down right evil while Loki is the good guy.9) *Not really an RPG:* I know the GoW franchise was always more of a heck&slash kind of game with some\, even if little\, RPG elements. I'm happy that the story has taken the front seat\, but I don't feel like I'm on the wheel yet\, but rather at the passenger's seat going for a lift. Since they were willing to do a overhaul of the franchise and by watching the trailers\, I sincerely hoped it would be closer to an RPG. I wanted to have dialogue options that would steam out different outcomes\, even if only in the side quests. Which leads me to:10) *Side-quests:* It's always a challenge for the dev team to make the side quests interesting enough so that the player don't feel bored or missing out on the main quest. Or feel like they're just farming for resources. That's exactly how I felt. The quests are mostly boring and repetive. So much so I didn't go back to the game after the main quest was over. And there are tons of unexplored content and areas. And I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. Just a shame\, I think everybody should take a lesson from the Witcher\, where most of the side quests are as interesting if not more than the main quest.11) *Unpopulated:* The world is empty of NPC\, except for the Dwarf Brothers (I guess some ghosts).12) *Combat:* Combat is non responsive\, the game prioritizes animation. Which means an enemy can one-hit kill you\, if you don't dodge in the right time. Except you cannot dodge because you already started an attack animation\, and it won't change midway through\, even if you press the button at the right time.13) Climbing down the chain when kicking it.14) Running around in circles when fast traveling to disguise the fact that they ARE cutting the camera.15) The game is too linear. Nuff said.… Expand"

I hate timed events in video games.  The main line story is very good\, and the combat is good.  Some of the enemies are op'ed\, and you don't have a great chance at winning.  There are some very annoying fights.  I like the side quests\, and that is what kept me playing.  I was good at finding the ravens\, and lining up the light root puzzles.  I did feel an accomplishment there.  My husband was trying to go platinum\, but he said the developers made the game too difficult for many people to achieve this accomplishment.  A lot of the areas you have to grind.   All in all I would rank all of the souls games\, charter games\, skyrim etc above this game.… Expand"

From its in depth story and character development to tight exhilarating combat God of War is a must buy game.I didn't want to review this game before completing the story as to fully experience the game\, and after playing for 2 or 3 solidWhat a fantastic experience God of War has to offer. Whatever type of gamer you are I believe you'll find something in this game that you love. From its in depth story and character development to tight exhilarating combat God of War is a must buy game.I didn't want to review this game before completing the story as to fully experience the game\, and after playing for 2 or 3 solid sessions of about 8 hours straight I can safely say it was fantastic. I absolutely loved the character development it really showed how every single person changed for the better or worse throughout the story. This was accompanied by the \""No break\"" development of the game in which there are no loading screens or cuts; you're always following the characters. I felt as if every character introduced was relevant in some way and they all had their own full characteristics\, making everything feel interactive. The antagonist was interesting\, and original and I always found him intimidating and fun to learn about. Expertly woven into the story of Kratos and Atreus\, Without any spoilers god of war follows a very simple plotline that dares to delve into a more complex narrative and it absolutely works.Another aspect of the game that was ingeniously designed was its open world; your choice to either follow the story or explore and find new crafting materials\, new lore\, new enemies and landscapes making exploring feel satisfying and worth it. While not breath of the wild in scale the open world\, without spoiling anything isn't just a base world but more multiple\, an interesting and original concept the works extremely well. Moreover when you explore it actually feels like you're going through genuine norse mythology\, you feel like you can discover new things round every corner\, and it's fantastic.A lot of people were disapproving of the combat system as the traditional ways of God of War have completely changed\, and I have to say for the better all around. I was finding new moves and skills even just before the end of the game! It feels satisfying to throw your axe\, see it hit 2 or 3 people far away and then call it back\, the vibrations in the controller\, while also hitting 2 or 3 more enemies on the way back. It's a very original combat system\, and while the dodging is more like a dark souls type feel it never grows old and is FUN the entire time. You end up having a skill set which is actually quite astonishing\, the amount of play styles and techniques you can use are amazing and you can weave them however way you want into your combat. There are even a few surprises with other weapons you can use\, but I wont spoil any of that.The game's RPG mechanics do not feel overly complicated while also giving you a lot of freedom in how you play. You gain crafting materials throughout God of War's stunning world\, which gives you incentive to go out and explore\, while also giving you a choice if you want to or not. Moreover it feels satisfying to upgrade your axe and increase your stats throughout the game\, every time you unlock a new move or slightly change your current ones it just feels amazing. And even if you don't want to change your moves at all you can always stick to the ones you have and upgrade them even further. The game's XP system works as well as you have up to 4 skill trees which you can level up\, allowing you to further play how you want. Overall the game's RPG mechanics give you a lot of freedom but doesn't overly complicate things to a monster hunter standard.Graphics and sound. Holy balls. This game is probably the best looking game I have ever seen\, period. It easily contends with the likes of horizon and uncharted and perhaps tops them. Playing this on a 4K HDR tv enhanced the experience for me even further. The colour pallet for this game is astronomical\, the colours pop out while also even having some meaning behind them. It distinguishes its landscapes while also looking breath taking all the while\, however it really makes you feel like you are where you are through its expert world design. You'll constantly be in awe in this game\, it's amazing. The sound work was sublime with a fantastic soundtrack and the sound effects and voice design... uncanny I have to say in terms of graphics and sound\, this game is probably the peak of what it can be\, simply perfect.Overall God of War was a daring attempt at a spin on an already fantastic franchise\, and it worked in every way possible. An interesting story line with original characters alongside it's \""no break\"" way of story telling\, all accompanied by breath taking visuals and sublime sound design\, this game is a MUST HAVE for any gamer out there. One of my favourite games of all time\, no question.… Expand"

I went in expecting changes and had faith in the team to do right by the series. I'm glad I did\, this is not just a beautiful game with a good story. But the God of War we know and love is still baked inside the new combat systems. There is still some crowd control management\, a new variation on QTE that isn't as abusive as God of War Ascension\, abilities are still necessary for over coming certain foes\, and the like. The game takes a bit to lean you into these facts as it is not only longer than past games in the series\, but it takes more care in easing you into those changes. At first it seems pretty bare\, but after a few hours it start to open up to the player. Puzzles are still a thing thankfully and still have some of the machinations of past god of wars. I was scared that there would be a loss in large scale boss fights leading to large scale destruction\, the spectacle is still very much alive in this game. The game does a great job of faking a nonlinear path with optional objectives and back tracking from a central hub world\, allowing the player to go back an explore the other realms in the game. Just the right amount of openness so you're not lost in it and just the right amount of restricted path to keep you focused.Equally so Bear McCreary certainly delivers in changing the music for this new norse approach. He was the right pick given his past works in mixing various styles an instruments to create a unique sound while maintaining the soul of god of war. You won't always feel the fierce power that you would from say the Colossus at Rhodes fight in God of War 2\, but you'll get a new kind of energy from the music that is distinctly God of War\, but also re-inventing what it means to be God of War music at the same time. I couldn't have picked a better composer for the job.Accessibility is also handled nicely in the settings menu. For those who are hearing impaired and have trouble seeing small text\, this game most definitely supports that breadth of features. Including a \""Subtitle Speaker\""\, \""Subtitle Background\"" in two settings (light and dark)\, some button remapping\, and features for handling environment interactions.  Such as repeated Button Presses from Tap and Hold\, Sprint input (press and hold X\, or click L3)\, Stun Grabs\, and input for the door Chisel mechanic which is either precision or single button. So hopefully this helps someone who is looking for this information. As a Game Dev myself (from a rival studio) I know how important this is for some people so I wanted to be sure this info was out there.Go into this game with an open mind and take in the great work and love that was put into it\, you will not be disappointed.… Expand"

82060,GOW2018,2018-05-19,10,"God of War\, es\, sin lugar a dudas una obra necesaria. Es un paso adelante\, no solo en el viaje del Fantasma de Esparta\, si no de la franquicia en general.El nuevo God of War es un respiro muy necesario a la ya gastada jugabilidad de los previos 6 juegos de la saga. Sin dudas\, mi hype estuvo justificado\, aunque tenía mis dudas en cuanto al combate\, la mejor sorpresa me la llevé en ésteGod of War\, es\, sin lugar a dudas una obra necesaria. Es un paso adelante\, no solo en el viaje del Fantasma de Esparta\, si no de la franquicia en general.El nuevo God of War es un respiro muy necesario a la ya gastada jugabilidad de los previos 6 juegos de la saga. Sin dudas\, mi hype estuvo justificado\, aunque tenía mis dudas en cuanto al combate\, la mejor sorpresa me la llevé en éste apartado.Historia (Sin spoilers)Un nuevo aire para la saga en general: Esta vez\, Kratos no busca venganza. Ahora tiene un hijo el cual es mitad Dios y tiene que prepararlo y enseñarle todo en cuanto esté a su alcance para que Atreus\, el \""NIÑO\""\, no repita sus mismos errores. Kratos podrá matar titanes mientras duerme\, pero a la hora de ser padre le toca sudar la gota gorda. Recorremos el viaje de Dios e hijo por las tierras de Midgard y otros reinos nórdicos mientras nos enfrentamos a bestias míticas y divinas (aunque con menor variedad que en entregas anteriores) para llevar las cenizas de la madre de Atreo al pico mas alto de todos los reinos\, en el cual descubriremos la verdad. Historia rica\, con olor a nuevo\, refrescante\, pero sin dudas\, necesaria. Su motivación principal\, en si\, es llevar las cenizas\, pero también deja un claro hueco dónde podemos pasar explorando\, cumpliendo objetivos opcionales y demás. No tiene la urgencia de un rescate\, ni la necesidad de una venganza. Solo un viaje.Jugabilidad: Mecánicas y combate.Como dije antes\,  lo que mas me sorprendió de esta nueva entrega es el combate.  Sigue siendo igual de brutal y frenético que antes\, pero ahora posee un pequeño componente estratégico debido a dos principales mecánicas: El hacha leviathan y la posición de la cámara.Podemos lanzar el hacha y continuar golpeando a mano limpia\, tranquilamente. Obviamente\, Kratos no está indefenso nunca. Seguimos contando con un escudo para hacer parry o esquivar como hacíamos antes. Pero ahora podemos usar esa hacha\, podemos apuntar hacia dónde queramos y podemos arrojarla y traerla de vuelta a voluntad. Hay enemigos con puntos débiles específicos y ventanas entre ataques en los cuales deberemos aprovechar para usar ésta habilidad. Y la posición de la cámara hace que tengamos que estar mas atentos a nuestro alrededor\, porque\, aunque no lo veas\, podrías tener un enemigo a tus espaldas\, y el escudo no te serviría de nada en ese caso.Tambien\, en vez de los ataques de poder que teníamos en anteriores juegos\, los cuales eran fijos. Ahora tenemos ataques rúnicos para nuestras armas\, son ataques muy poderosos\, los cuales se pueden cambiar cuando queramos\, eso si\, no podemos spammear éstos ataques ya que tienen un tiempo de recarga.Tambien tenemos un contenedor de Furia el cual se irá llenando al dar o recibir golpes. Y el cual podremos usar para destrozar a los enemigos y de paso\, recuperar un poco de salud.Atreo tambien combate. Si\, aunque sea un \""NIÑO\""\, atreo nos va a salvar el culo mas de una vez\, usando sus flechas y sus ataques rúnicos\, al cual le podremos ordenar disparar usando el botón [Cuadrado]\, tampoco podremos spammearlo todo el tiempo\, pero aún así lo podemos usar para nuestra ventaja\, siempre que queramos. Y lo mejor de todo. El niño no jode nunca y rara vez  tendremos que ayudarlo (me ha pasado 2 o 3 veces en TODO el 100% del juego).Atreo tambien tiene la posibilidad de revivirnos al menos una vez si caemos en combate\, lo cual puede pasar con enemigos poderosos\, y lo cual es mas común de lo que imaginan si van a combatir con jefes opcionales.Todas las habilidades\, tanto de Atreo con su arco como de Kratos con sus armas se pueden mejorar y subir de nivel.En cuanto al movimiento\, podemos esprintar\, ya que hay backtracking (siempre que queramos\, por lo general no es obligatorio).Kratos ya no salta\, pero todos los movimientos como saltar a una saliente\, escalar y demás se pueden completar con el boton contextual: [O]. y al esquivar tendremos que usar [X] ya que con los sticks ahora debemos controlar al personaje y a la cámara.Tambien hay un bote\, en el cual sucederan la mayor parte de las conversaciónes entre personajes.Exploración:Tenemos una gran y variada cantidad de lugares por explorar\, los cuales\, en su totalidad\, todos poseen coleccionables valiosos\, misiones secundarias\, jefes opcionales\, pequeños puzzles\, mejoras y armaduras. Y no solo en el Reino de Midgard\, pero bueno\, no voy a hacer spoiler. Sin dudas es algo que se agradece\, porque entre tanto combate\, está bueno que haya momento para quietud\, para respiros y para recompenzas. Recompenzas que valen la pena\, realmente.Sin lugar a dudas\, God of War supone un paso de titan para la franquicia\, de la cual\, espero podamos seguir viendo juegos con mas historias y mitologías. Sin dudas\, ésto era necesario\, tanto para Sony\, como para nosotros. Excelente juego\, excelente historia\, increíble ambientación y muy divertido gameplay.Solo Disfruten.… Expand"

This is truly a huge change in the gameplay but not once have I felt that this isn't the Kratos that I've come to love all these years. Plus\, character development. Really good.

That at first may look bland and forced\, but the more you play the more it works\, offering stunning good looking armours and weapon.- In general\, this is how to turn a burnout franchise into a brand new start\, delivering a full AAA game in all senses.… Expand"

82171,GOW2018,2018-04-30,9,"Firstly let me just say\, truly amazing game the graphics are astounding with only a few muddy bits here and there but they're patching it\, ps4 pro is a must with this\, the combat is less wildly swinging and more calculated and intelligent with it's share of crazy moments.The rpg elements are a great balance and the feel of The last of us with the kid following you on this journey is a welcome change to give this series a new breath of fresh air so it doesn't end up stagnating in it's past (Which was good but games need to evolve too)The AI on the child is smart and rarely gets in your way or is seen standing around doing nothing\, the story-telling and dialogue during the journey is fantastic.It is true the enemies are less giant than what they use to be however I bet this is the first of this Nordic journey so give it time and it'll pick up\, I bet the kid will become a lot more stronger and kratos will slowly get his drive for violence back and the enemies become giant once more.Now! For those voting this game a 0 - 4 out of 10 please remove yourself from the website\, I have read the reviews and if Metacritic had a pulse on this site please admins remove them\, they are not even helpful and they lack intelligent reason for the score other than they expected it to be like the previous games\, you must understand that this is a new game and this looks to be the beginning of their journey which means simply rating it a 0 is Beyond dishonest!Shame on everyone that reviewed this a 0 - 4 without even playing this first or even giving it a chance\, So many of us love it and welcome the return on this amazing series and it is only beginning so give it time and I bet we will see the kratos we remember while seeing the child grow up to be lethal as well\, it does miss out on that final point mainly because some enemies have a ridiculous split second tracking making that tiny second early dodge nets you a direct hit and some times the camera feels as if I'm locked onto an enemy while not actually being locked on but other then that like I said they are fixing bugs and these problems so far that I have had seem to be tiny in comparison to other games so the point taken off doesn't detract from the games amazing new story.Some people cannot be won over no matter what and judging from the comments on the 325 reviews voting it negatively so far this game is better off for it because these changes would give us a god of war 4 and not the new god of war we have and frankly if I wanted to play a game that had a crazy chain-blade swinging Kratos I'd replay the old ones\, honestly games much like music have to develop a game with how the market is going in mind and what the market will be like in however many years they estimate they will be able to get the games out\, many games are moving away from old formulas and the ones that are suffering\, a few games come to mind but find my full review on my page and my channel because there I don't have restriction on what I am allowed to write.The combat is weighty also\, making every hit on those light and medium ones feel like you are using heavy force on them\, large enemies still reel back after an axe blow at times unlike a few games I have played that are just lazy (No Monster hunter world is not one of them)Honestly Guys and Girls\, buy this game at 60 or 100 (for AUS) and you won't be disappointed unlike Destiny 2 and FFXV (Sorry people but where I live I have seen so many returned copies of both games it even amazed me\, not to mention watching the marketing on both and the schemes implemented to stretch out the play life of both is pretty transparent.I don't believe this will have any dlc content because I believe they'll just set it for a new console\, that being the case you may see the next game on the next gen consoles in 2020 (if the estimated date is to be believed)… Expand"

I wonder why they did not made a button \""kill boss\"" (there is one and is called \""give me a story\"" mode).You also wonder why you always to backtrack back and forth on this damn lake.

All enemies in the game are dead already).You see people compared this to Dark Souls\, there was even the director stating \""we dont want to be really like dark souls\"" - dont you worry you are as far away from Dark Souls as possible.This is a beatiful graphic novel with a bit of combat thrown in.

An end game after credits questline. This game is fleshed out to the max at least 30hours of content and thats if you leave some behind.No cutscenes what I mean is its a continues camera over shot never fades to black goes into some CGI video everything is done using the game engine a fully immersive exsperiance.To those who are worried about it being to hard compared to dark souls dont be the difficulty is as difficult as you want it to be it has a story immersive mode as well as a Chaos mode also no trophy is linked to difficulty feel free to change it mid game no reprocussions.The graphics push the original and slim PS4 to max and looks gorgeous dont worry about not having a pro it runs so smooth on original slim and I haven't encountered any problems Run a full game test on each.The story is a masterpiece of subtle relationship progression between a father Kratos and his son Atraues as they journey to scatter the mothers ashes which opens a whole new Lore and gods for Kratos things quickly spiral as secrets are reveleaved and some epic encounters ensue\, I wont say to much suffice to say the story will drive you through the game whether you like it or not.Overall Kory Barlog has created a wonderful exsperiance that should be enjoyed by every playstion 4 owner\, it has something for everyone those who love deep combat but easy enough for those who dont\, story loving gamers for those who just want to push past side content\, open world gamers who want side missions collectables\, exsploration\, and enough end game content Go esplore and defeat the Valkyrie complete all the challenges.Things to bear in mind this is the start of a trilogy but is self contained in scope\, but that means not all realms are available as if they would let you go straight to Asgard. Probably no DLC as stated by development straight to work on sequel especially for PS4 if want it as last game Most likely through PS5 launch title.Lastly dont forget to go home at end of game for secret ending dont worry can still play post credits that ending will have you hyped for next one.Many thanks for reading I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did if unsure watch gameplay footage read more reviews.… Expand"

There are many different places you go and each place has its own theme for the most part\, and really makes it interesting to see whats around each corner. The artists did a great job bringing the environment to life and giving the story a fantastic foundation.When it comes to exploring these places all of your extra effort is rewarded with meaningful rewards and makes you want to explore more which helps you appreciate the level design as well as more of the art.The narrative\, I must say\, is amazing. So many times I found myself listening to an npc just hear what they had to say. This is very out of the ordinary for me\, however\, I do love mythology. So hearing an alternate version of some Norse mythology is probably right up my ally. Either way\, you will likely appreciate the way Kratos and Atreus interact with each other.Combat is very fun\, they did an amazing job in my opinion making it versatile enough that when i'm fighting i'm not always using the same techniques. The enemies\, again\, are diverse and offer interesting situations.I would not recommend playing the hardest difficulty unless you've beaten the game. I say this not because it is difficult but because it becomes cheesy and monotonous. You will find yourself maximizing damage through sometimes cheesy techniques because it is the best/only way to move forward and this can ruin much of the fun of the many versatile and unique techniques/things you gain in the game.

If you felt the same way as me\, there's hope for you now as this reboot of the series is absolutely incredible.It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a single player campaign as much as I've enjoyed GoW\, at least a console generation or two. For the record I've completed (or nearly completed) a good few of Nintendo's and Sony's big hitters like Mario Oddysey\, Breath of the Wild\, Bloodborne\, Last of Us\, Metal Gear 5\, and Horizon\, as well as the great non-exclusives like Witcher 3 and GTA5. While those are all great titles\, God of War really makes me feel like it's the killer app of the last half decade.God of War's mechanics don't do anything particularly new\, in fact\, the core exploration/world mechanic is very much like a Metroid game where the number of available paths available increase when gaining a new item from the main quest line. This was fine with me as it kept the pace of the main quest tight\, and that's where the game has one of it's strongest points: the cutscenes\, the set pieces\, the characters and the dialogue are all very well woven into the story and provided me with entertainment that surpassed all of the above titles that I mentioned. Quality over quantity.Then there's the graphics; no need to explain here\, it's just the best looking thing on the ps4. Period.And finally\, the combat; God of War's combat surpasses games like Bloodborne\, Breath of the Wild and Horizon. Kratos' axe throw\, in particular\, feels great with the rest of his move-set\, as well as his son's arrow mechanic. Your moves can be fast or strong and the over the shoulder camera brings a sort of hefty feel to your actions. The game can be a serious challenge (on the Challenging difficulty) that rivals a Souls game. Blocking\, dodging\, and knowing your enemies' moves are required. The enemies are varied\, and some are introduced in really cool ways (like the Revenant cave). When a certain enemy was around\, I found myself prioritizing and flinging them into another stronger enemy for stun value. I found myself orienting so that I could push them into walls\, and off of cliffs—things that were necessary to survive. I can't stress how much I enjoyed the combat and exploration\, which rewarded me with the gear to be able to kill off the final valkyrie.Buy this one\, it's a must have.… Expand"

Times change though and I now play on both consoles which meant the latest God of War caught my attention. I found myself researching the past games and instantly knew that this would be right up my street. God of War was hyped up to astronomical levels and the question became\, could it live up to that hype.Long story short yes it most certainly has lived up to the hype. Visually the game looks stunning on both versions of the PS4 consoles and aside from the odd dropped frame here and there\, offers a smooth playing experience. The game world is so detailed and simply beautiful. some areas where there is a lot of colour took my breath away as HDR blasted the scenes into my eyeballs. These areas really take your breath away and you find yourself just looking around soaking up the beauty.The game is set in Midgard and you find yourself thrown into Norse mythology and once again the developers have really nailed the feel. You aren't alone in your travels this time round and are accompanied by Kratos' son Atreus. Normally AI sidekicks tend to be a pain in the arse but they really nailed the implementation here. Never does your \""Boy\"" feel unhelpful or get in the way and he instead can prove to be very helpful and breaks the quieter sections up nicely with the dialogue.I shan't go too much into the the story because of spoilers but It is honestly one of the best stories I've been able to enjoy in a game in recent years. Well written and fully engrossing i found myself captured by it and like a good book that's hard to put down I've found i have to force myself to stop playing when real life demands my attention.All this positivity means nothing if the gameplay sucks but I'm happy to report that once again the developer have hit the nail on the head (presumably with Thors Hammer). Things start off typically enough but soon you are thrust into one of the most epic opening fights that will be remembered for years to come. Combat feels awesome with each hit feeling as if it has real weight behind it and different enemies requiring slightly differing tactics. It really is one of the most satisfying things when you land those swings of the axe. The new camera works a treat and throws you into the action\, anyone who had concerns should rest easy because it just works.The seamless transitions from gameplay to cut scene helps keep immersion and this is yet another example of just how good Chequer-boarding is to get those lush crisp visuals. It's obvious from start to finish that a lot of hard work\, care and attention has gone into God of War and it's paid off big time. God of War is going to be one of the titles that define this generation and it's certainly the best we've seen so far. Normally my GOTY is a struggle between a few titles but i think this is a dead cert with only Red Dead Redemption 2 likely to offer any kind of competition.… Expand"

The game became much more enjoyable once I no longer cared what Kratos and \""boy\"" was wearing and all the stuff he was picking up.Last thing I will bash is the inability to skip cut scenes.

82234,GOW2018,2018-05-12,10,"Bought a PS4 just for this one and it didn't dissapoint one bit. Storytelling and visuals are on a whole different level than everything else. But I'm sure you've read a lot of positive reviews so I'm going to address the negatives around here. Basically\, they look like written by people angry about it being better rated than their favorite games\, and the reasons they put this down are quite ridiculous.Saying it doesn't have a good storytelling is the first thing you need to ignore. I never played another GOW before\, but I played GOW3 just before this one to get in shape. This is leaps and bounds beyond that\, a much more rational and emotional approach than the blind blood-hungry Kratos from the past.Gameplay has also evolved a lot and it DOESNT HAVE ANYTHING to do with the Souls Series. Beat Bloodborne just before GOW3 (I bought Bloodborne\, Uncharted 4 and GOW3 while I waited for this to be released) Combat is unique and is right in the middle of an action game and an RPG. Upgrades are awesome and well balanced. Nothing feels like too much or too little.I've also seen people talking about its difficulty. Yes\, it's not an easy game\, but if difficulty is a handicap for you\, then play it on easy. Bloodborne is as hard as this one (In hard difficulty\, the one I played it on) but it doesn't let you chose between levels of difficult\, this one does. Once you get used to it's gameplay and upgrade yourselves enough\, everything is beatable except for the hardest enemies on the game which you will discover when you play it.Same goes for fans of Uncharted\, and older GOW games that couldn't get over this one. Just forget all you've read positive or negative about this game and enjoy this adventure. There are a lot of chances you will find it unforgettable.… Expand"

Sony Santa Monica Studio have made a game that is not only a masterpiece on its own\, but also comes at a time when the video game industry seems to believe that single player games can't survive or be successful without a huge open world or tacked on multiplayer mode to sell. it doesn't have any microtransactions to bring in extra money either\, and its all the better for it.Where other companies would take one look at adding a sequel to Kratos' journey and would give it a large open world filled with many icons and boring side missions that barely differ from each other\, Santa Monica Studio decided to take a risk. A risk that paid off immensely as the game is not only being universally praised but also is the fastest selling playstation 4 game to date. its a love letter to gamers that enjoy a good story along with great gameplay. And God of War's gameplay is not only great\, its incredible. The combat feels satisfying and rewarding all while being just as brutal as before. The progression and rpg elements may seem confusing at first\, but once you understand them\, they become a very fun and useful system that adds even more strategy to the already fantastic combat. I also rarely encountered any bugs or glitches throughout my near 40 hours spent in the game. The beautiful graphics look amazing and are even more impressive considering the camera never cuts\, not even for a cut-scene. This makes the game feel more immersive and personal than just about any game I've ever played. It makes the action set pieces and big story moments feel even better and more powerful as well. To go along with it is the fantastic performances by the cast. Of course\, Kratos and Atreus are at the forefront\, but the supporting characters are also very well acted and voiced.The level design is impeccable\, it encourages exploration and finding secret areas better than any linear game ever made. Its also all the more satisfying to see huge action sequences tear up the area and make you change up your play style. The levels and exploration are nearly flawless in execution\, and make replaying or revisiting them utter joys.My only complaints about the game\, and they are minor\, would be that I would like more challenge in some of the games main story boss fights as well as more boss fights in the games story mode. However\, the optional valkyrie boss fights are great and provided me with some very challenging fights that could took me anywhere from two to over twenty tries to complete.Overall\, God of War proves to be an innovative\, polished\, fun gaming tour de force. It throws out unsavory business practices and exchanges them for the simplicity of just making a good game as one of your main selling points. And Sony Santa Monica Studio has not only made one of the best games of all time\, but also the best game of this generation. And I cant wait to see where the series goes next.… Expand"

The level design should be praised separately. GoW is essentially a \""metroidvania\"" - the story itself is linear\, but the game world is interconnected and certain paths open up later in the game. The result is that we essentially get a huge\, beautifully hand-made open world with lots of places to explore and side quests to complete. And the side quests here aren't Ubisoft-style copy-paste garbage\, but are made at the same level of quality as the main one.The visuals are stunning\, everything is very detailed and the vistas are breathtaking. The soundtrack is yet another aspect of the game done right\, it has already joined my music library. An additional immersion factor is the artistic decision to make the game \""one-shot\""\, with no camera cuts. While it may sound like a small detail\, it really adds to the cinematic feel. It's a real shame that the Photo Mode has just come out\, after I've already beaten the game. While I'm not sure whether it's *the* best-looking game on PS4\, it's certainly on par with the likes of Uncharted 4.The story here isn't very original - it's essentially a journey from point A to point B with obstacles along the way\, but it's masterfully done and you actually care for the characters. Kratos feels believable as a father figure trying to come to terms with his past\, he's no longer a one-note brute killing everyone and screaming about revenge. What the game also does great is introducing the concept of a world where all the mythologies coexist\, with references not only to Greek and Norse\, but also to Egyptian\, Maya and even Japanese. This opens up numerous possibilities for the franchise's future.Now GoW isn't perfect\, nothing really is. There were a couple of logically questionable moments in the story\, the whole Alfheim level felt meaningless and was just a way to stretch the journey a bit\, and perhaps there were too many identical Troll and Ancient boss fights. I'd also say that some combat mechanics could be added to the boat sequences\, instead of you just rowing back and forth. Besides\, while the game strikes a good balance with its loot system\, the Niflheim realm feels a bit too grind-ey.Still\, those are minor nitpicks as the overall experience is just overwhelmingly positive.

You look at your big enemies from the bottom what makes you feel small. Basically I would not say is better is just different that before and it is good. GOW 3 felt the same as previous parts and it needed a new mechanics. Axe mechanics are awesome and throwing it feels very satisfying. Now it is semi open world as well. I loved that they decided not to follow a part of \""WE HAVE A HUGE empty WORLD) world is not as big as other titles but it is a very interesting and challenging to explore around. Some side quests are well written. There is also a lot of challenges that are worth taking. Atreus is a nice companion and will help you a lot. He helps with battles\, and he is good as navigator. Customization and upgrade systems are good. Better than before. Lots of things to choose.This part as you would expect has a better story and a very cool moments. Do not wanna spoiling everything but your god of war fanboying part of the heart will be very excited in one particular moment that for sure. And If you know norse mythology you will be surprised how they connected Kratos and Atreus to it.

Performance on PS4 Pro is smooth and steady no matter what resolution you choose.Overall I love new direction of this part. Some cutscenes are amazingly cool. There is no loading screens(even tho you can see where game is slowing down for other scene to load up) Some bosses are cool. Especially \""Stranger\""\, all scenes with him are epic.

I have been a fan of the series since the first God of War because of the combat and the fact that I was learning Greek mythology in school at the same time. Every new installation of the game was a chance for me to get lost in the altered mythos that Santa Monica had created. Prior to this game\, my knowledge ofWhen God of War (2018) was announced I was extremely excited\, yet skeptical. I have been a fan of the series since the first God of War because of the combat and the fact that I was learning Greek mythology in school at the same time. Every new installation of the game was a chance for me to get lost in the altered mythos that Santa Monica had created. Prior to this game\, my knowledge of Norse mythology was almost non-existent\, but as I played through the game I became more and more intrigued until I finally started researching the Prose Edda. To me\, the encouragement of curiosity is an important aspect of what makes a game great. The story and emotional progression presented here between Kratos and Atreus is only rivaled (in my opinion) by Joel and Ellie from Naughty Dog's The Last of Us. At times Atreus did become a nuisance\, but there was always a reason for his character to misbehave. Every character trait is deliberate and is used to further the narrative\, nothing is overlooked. This game's story telling and attention to detail is something that other game developers should take note on. Along the journey you will encounter a character whose entire existence is fantastic story telling design\, there were times that I found myself wanting to stay on boat just to hear the stories he told. Even the side quests assist in breathing life to the lore of the world around you. There are tons of references to the prior installations of God of War\, and each one of them is fantastic. Santa Monica does a great job of cluing the player in on Kratos's past\, so not having played the prequels should not hinder your experience.The portion of the game for which I was skeptical was the combat. BOY was I wrong. The combat feels fantastic. Each combat style feels properly weighted and have different purposes. Striking with the axe feels extremely satisfying and the runic attacks are fun to play around with. Throwing the axe is great and never gets old. The addition of a \""stun\"" meter gives you purpose to attack using your fists and shield\, or any other attack that inflicts stun. When the stun meter fills up you can perform a finishing attack using the R3 button. Even Atreus himself is an integral part of the combat\, in fact\, in the tougher difficulties\, he's crucial to your success. The camera may take a little bit of getting used to\, but if you have played the other God of War games (or other action RPGs like Monster Hunter or Dark Souls) you will still feel at home with this installation. There are indicators on the bottom of the screen which alert you when an enemy is attacking from the sides or from behind and you will also receive verbal cues from Atreus.The only negative aspect of this game is the lack of bosses for how long the game is. Don't get me wrong the bosses that furthered the main plot were amazing (this includes the \""main\"" side quest boss)\, but the mini bosses were lacking. There are technically plenty of boss fights\, but only a few of them I would consider proper boss fights. This does not impact the overall experience however\, especially since the main bosses are epic and challenging.I wish only the best to Santa Monica going forward and want to thank Sony for providing the proper conditions for a game like this to thrive. 10/10.… Expand"

Being a God Of war fan right from the beginning\, and indeed it was my first game on PS3\, I wanted it to follow the same old locked camera tradition.

But as the time passed by\, they launched few more in-game gameplay. After witnessing and analysing those gameplay\, I learnt that what exactly the devs are trying to do and how sure Santa Monica and sony is about the reboot version of the game. I ended up pre ordering collector's edition. But today\, when I got my hands on it and explored the game to some extent\, I admit this is the game that I always dreamt about. This is the game I believe set a new benchmark in the history of gaming entertainment. This is the game of my dreams it's beautiful\, brutal and badass. The presentation of the game is so good...that the players will feel that they are living the game. It feels as if we are watching some live action movie. The combat style and system seems to be amazingly well designed. Puzzle also keeps you busy ( only done 1-2 for now ) over all it also test your presence of mind.So far from what I have played\, it seems to be deep understanding and bonding between father and son.Apart from this\, the whole new world and the design of combat system is impressive.I personally want to thank Cory Barlog for creating and shaping such a masterpiece game.

82350,GOW2018,2018-06-03,10,"God of War is an action-adventure\, hack and slash video game franchise made by Santa Monica Studios. The previous games followed Kratos as he went on a rampage seeking revenge against the Greek Gods for the death of his wife and daughter. This new God of War takes Kratos on a new adventure with his son\, Atreus\, as they go on an adventure to spread the ashes of the boy’s mother at theGod of War is an action-adventure\, hack and slash video game franchise made by Santa Monica Studios. The previous games followed Kratos as he went on a rampage seeking revenge against the Greek Gods for the death of his wife and daughter. This new God of War takes Kratos on a new adventure with his son\, Atreus\, as they go on an adventure to spread the ashes of the boy’s mother at the highest peak in the nine realms as her last wish. On their travels they face tasks and obstacles that they must overcome\, including some not so friendly people. Kratos and Atreus also have their own personal conflict that some fathers and sons go through but they eventually work it out and are able to complete their journey.In the beginning of the game\, you get treated with the standard tutorial missions that teach you the basics like movement and simple combat. You are then taken into a cutscene which leads you into a fight with a stranger that comes knocking at your door. During your fight against this stranger\, he continues to get up no matter how much punishment you dish out. Eventually your fight will come to an end and you can get back to your son\, but you will keep seeing him throughout the story. You will meet other challenging foes throughout the game\, as well as some friendly ones along your travels. Reaching the end of your journey with Atreus\, the both of you learn the reason that his mother wanted the two of you to spread her ashes on the highest peak of the nine realms. After you spread her ashes and learn the reasoning to this long journey\, you can continue to explore this new God of War realm. For those who like secret endings\, then you will probably want to go back to Kratos’ home from the beginning of the game and go to sleep.Playing through God of War was both fun and challenging. I played the game on the default difficulty and still found myself dying when surrounded by mobs or going up against a tough enemy. The combat in the game felt weird in the beginning and I was not a fan of it\, but after playing for a couple of hours I got used to it and have to admit it gives you many ways to use Kratos’ arsenal. The standard loadout that you get in the beginning is the Leviathan Axe and Atreus for support. As you progress through the story you can upgrade your axe by combing grips\, runes\, and skill points. Atreus can also be upgraded with his armor\, which offers him different abilities or boost based on the armor you choose for him. I have not been able to fully upgrade my axe for Kratos but i enjoy the upgrades that i do have on them.Some of the things that I liked about God of War were the side quests and being able to upgrade your equipment. As I mentioned before\, you can upgrade your equipment using a combination of things but I failed to go into detail about the armor that Kratos wears. Kratos can have his armor upgraded like Atreus but he gets a lot more options. Not only does he get armor that has different looks but his armor also gives him boosts to his attributes. Depending on your playstyle\, you can choose armor that focuses on offense\, defense\, or being balanced. Each armor set has materials that you need to gather to create it and this gave me another reason to explore the other realms. The side quests in the game\, also known as favors\, are given to you by different NPCs throughout the game. Not only will you be rewarded with gear and items that can make the rest of your journey easier\, but it also gives you a chance to learn more about the lore. I liked doing side quests because it also gave me a chance to take a break from the main story.. The only negative thing I have to say about the game would be the combat learning curve at the beginning of the game\, but I have already mentioned that it was not too hindering.God of War is an action packed game that I enjoyed playing and will keep playing because I have yet to complete everything that the game has to offer. Whether it was trekking my way to the highest peak in the nine realms or completing some side quests that Atreus insisted on doing\, God of War managed to keep my attention with its story and gameplay. If you own a PS4\, then I highly recommend you get God of War and journey with Kratos and Atreus.… Expand"

God of War is one of the most epic and satisfying experiences modern entertainment has to offer. It's visually immaculate and never lets you go with it's \""one shot\"" camera keeping you hooked to the masterfully told story which is accompanied by one of the best soundtracks in recent memory.  Like all god of war games\, the story is simple in plot but grand in scale with never a dull moment. However this time we are treated to a protagonist that isn't one dimensional along with extremely well developed and interesting supporting characters\, all of which fill the beautiful game world which feels real and is rich with lore. The combat is better than ever and the enemies you encounter along the way are plentiful in type yet all the same terrifying. All die hard fans of the series rejoice\, the gore is better than ever.  It all comes together to create one of the most beautiful worlds to get lost in and explore since Skyrim.As I stated in the beginning of the review\, God of war isn't just a masterpiece of a game but an important one. In a time where single player games are being replaced by what big companies like to call \""games as a service\"" which focus more on the maximisation of profit by providing players with a base  game that feels empty and charging extra for content to fill the experience\, God of War serves as an important message that single player games are not only dead but are better than ever providing players with a full and satisfying experience without trying to steal every last dime from your pocket. God of War respects you and should be experienced by every gamer especially those who own a ps4. Thank you Cory Barlog and everyone over at Santa Monica Studios\, not only for the unforgettable journey but for making me fall in love with gaming all over again. I know you put all your heart in making this game and it paid off with flying colours.… Expand"

However\, what keeps me from giving the game a perfect score are two small issues. The combat\, even though it's fun\, is nothing outstanding and can sometimes get old\, and what gets really old is the constant puzzles. I normally don't have a problem with puzzles but certain areas of the game sometimes literally have 2 or 3 puzzles in them\, and then you go into the next room\, and have two or three more. Most of these puzzles are not difficult\, but most of them are also the same thing again\, and again\, and again\, and again\, and that gets boring and feels more like a weak way to break up combat and story rather than having a point. Overdoing anything can be a problem\, but when you are constantly slogging along because puzzles keep slowing you down\, it becomes a problem.

82435,GOW2018,2018-04-25,10,"I enjoyed the previous god of war games\, but to me they all felt kinda tedious with very boring combat that one could just button mash to get through. Get one of the are of effect combos and you could pretty much just repeat that forever. But I always loved the epic story of God of War and I was very excited for this new iteration of the series because they where going to change things up.And ever since i started the game I have not been able to put it down much\, for a week this game has been on my thoughts for most of the time. It is truly a masterpiece of a game in all regards. The story is amazing with incredible moments of both emotion\, action and just scale. I might be biased since I am from Scandinavia\, but the use of the Norse mythology in this game is the absolute best representation of it that i have seen in my life.The characters you meet are very likable and it has really cool villains. But I have to give major credit to Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic for their roles as Kratos and Atreus\, they do an excellent job\, the emotion in both their performances are superb. Likable child characters is a hard thing to master\, but this game truly did. I do have to say that the story is way more personal than previous games\, and while there are many big set piece moments of pure epicness. There are not as many as in previous games\, and there is more time in between these moments. But more on that later when I get into the gameplay part of the game.What also helps immensely with the story is of course the graphical representation\, it is once again superbly done and it is amazing what they have accomplished when it comes to console gaming. The use of lighting is some of the best I have ever seen\, and the camera work and the idea of having this continuous camera that never stops makes it really feel like a journey without artificial pauses. The character models\, animations\, the monsters and perhaps the most important aspect\, the locations and the world itself is just breathtaking to look at.Now for the gameplay\, this is probably my all time favorite action game ever. It is amazing how much better this combat system is than the previous games. It is tactical\, it is challenging but very fair\, it is also a huge amount of fun. I have at least played the game for about 40 hours and I am just in love with the combat. And the progression system is a very welcomed new addition\, be it the skill trees or the new RPG styled equipment system. Searching every nook and corner of the massive world is very fun and rewarding.Now the game is not perfect\, and there are a few issues here and there. One problem for me is that too many times I had to fight the same troll enemy as minor bosses. While they sometimes got a few new skills and they looked different. It did get a bit boring that so many minor boss encounters where just clones of the troll enemy. While there is a lot of variety in how enemies look\, they do reuse enemies a bit too much imo. I hope that the sequel brings in a lot more variation in how enemies actually act and not just look. Which brings me to another minor gripe with the game. While the story has a satisfying ending\, it does not really feel complete and it does end with a cliffhanger.I am not sure how they will continue the story\, but I fear the real ending will come with DLC. This I am not very fond off to be honest. That being said\, I am of course excited for what is to come\, but I hate to have to wait for either DLC or a sequel to come out to truly finish this tale.But as a complete package\, God of War is one of those few games that comes along that truly sets the bar for other games. I have had a blast playing it and I still have more hours ahead of me with God of War as there is still so much content to go through in it. Uncharted 4 was my favorite PS4 game\, but God of War have now taken that place. It is also among my top 5 games of all time and I just can't give it anything less than a full score.10/10\, a must buy game for every PS4 owner.… Expand"

Although I will rate the game a 10 because it deserves it due to being outstanding in many ways to hundreds of so far released games BUT I think there are still things that should be improved and are being listed here so you can rate for yourself whether that might be a deal breaker for you:- Loudness on PS4 Pro can be a pain at times. The outstanding graphics take its toll here which can be getting on your very personal nerves at time. This is also due to fps glitching in some menues which could be fixed.- Traveling in an open world that is not so open world as it seems. The world is kind of interconnected but not completely and the map is awful at times giving you the wrong lead at where to go.- The combat system is pretty decent although for me personally I found it too complex at times especially when you think of it as an GoW game which it isnt anymore!- A nice reboot but lost a little bit of its old feeling. maybe good for better but I stil miss the arcade like mashing in smooth and fast paced battles.- The iconic bad ass boss battles are missing out a bit.- Trophy hunting got me bored pretty fast. I think the goals could ve been more fun but for gods sake I just dont want to run around and look at every inch for some stuff or bird to kill.

Something the xbox one brand lacks in spades lol. Name me one single freaking must have exclusive on the xbox one? YOU CAN'T! Also you can get xbox one games on pc so why even bother with the xbox one? Getting a 360 makes a lot more sense... Getting a wiiu makes a lot more sense. Getting a ps3 makes more sense. Getting a switch\, ps4\, and or PC makes a lot more sense. The only thing that would make less sense than getting the xbox one is getting into trash micro transaction phone games like candy crush lol.That being said... Ps4 has must haves like bloode borne\, zero dawn\, and now it has god of war 4 which is basically... Game of the year material. Red dead 2 will probably win it which is a shame because rockstar is going to put in pay to win micro transactions for both multiplayer and campaign apparently. Lets hope that changes... But for now it's looking pretty lame... UNLIKE God of war 4 which is a great game. The only reason I didn't give a 10 is because no game is perfect as every game eventually shows you something that you dislike about it. This game however nails story\, visuals\, and fun game play at the same time being something a little new that we haven't quite seen before in gaming. It basically nails what gaming needs these days in the dark age of gaming... Don't believe me when I say dark age? Cod\, destiny\, over watch\, battle front\, battle field\, 343 halo games\, phone app games\, predatory business practices of micro transaction dude bro online pay to win random nube fest bro shooters are crapping on the gaming world. Dark times indeed. Which is why it's nice to see a gem like god of war 4 make a appearance and show the world how you make a freaking video game son!I know I sound like a xbox one hater but to be honest... Xbox one has the best online for smooth internet and features. The console is the most powerful if you got the xbox one x. And it's controller is the best for console shooters. Also the backwards compat for both orig/360 is great. Other than that though it's pretty much garbage compared to the modern day competition. I own 4 xbox 360s and have played about 20000 online matches across several bungie halo games. Also own a modded xbox orig with 30000 games on it. So when I say the xbox one pretty much blows... You know I'm being realistic. I would love for the xbox one to be great but no... It sucks for the most part because of one VERY important reason. NO MUST HAVE EXCLUSIVES! Perhaps xbox one will change my mind and make me call it a great console if they can at least deliver us 2-3 must haves before the generation is over. AT LEAST! Come on microsoft! Get it together man! Stop canceling games and giving us garbage! Sea of who?… Expand"

It may not be bloated with content and side quests like The Witcher 3 but it has an incredible amount of content that will have your hands full for upwards of 100 hours if you want to complete everything in the game.Anyone complaining about the combat being simple are flat out lying. There are literally dozens of button combinations\, combo strings\, and chargeable abilities for Kratos alone. That isn't even considering Atreus' gamut of support abilities which are also controllable by the player. Playing on the easiest setting you can hack and slash through the game\, but that is exactly what easy difficulty settings are for. You absolutely cannot play that way on the two highest settings without dying literally hundreds of times. If you want to challenge yourself in this game with higher difficulties\, you absolutely must master parrying\, shield play\, spatial awareness\, and crowd control.The vast majority of 0 reviews here are the typical troll fare that can be expected on Metacritic. None of them have actually played the game and are salty Xbox and Nintendo fanboys that have nothing better to do since their consoles only have a handful of decent games.

82493,GOW2018,2018-04-26,10,"O. M. G.  I wanted to hate this game\, I wanted to give it a bad review\, because I like and adore the old games.  I'm the opposite of current gaming trends. I hate multi player with no single player campaign\, I hate open world and I hate high difficulty.  I get impatient with games very easily\, hence the no open world and high difficulty.  Especially the difficulty\, I'll never understand why dying over and over is fun to people.  In a game I like to feel powerful and high difficulty is the opposite of that.  Life itself is hard and makes you powerless so why would I want that in a video game? Despite modern popular opinion\, I love hack and slash and button mashers.  The old GOW games were everything I love about games and the new GOW should have been everything I hate.Do I hate it?  No\, I love it.  Somehow they have done the impossible and glued me to video game traits I hate.  Every time I think the game is boring something blows my mind. Every time I think the game is too difficult because I died it only takes me one more try to defeat the enemy.  They have struck almost a perfect balance with the difficulty.  These things keep happening over and over and I am physically unable to stop playing. During my most recent play through I felt again like I was going to waver away from the game but the ultimate jaw drop happened.  They introduced my beloved Blades Of Chaos into the game.  That's right the very same beloved weapon of the rest of the series.  This comes out of nowhere and you are not expecting it because through the first half of the game they have you convinced that you really do only have your bare hands\, ax and shield as weapons.  I nearly cried from surprise and excitement.  This single surprise is what has sparked me to write a review.  I almost never write reviews but when those blades entered the game I felt like i had to shout from mountain tops.  Of course everyone knows the graphics and visuals are spectacular as well.In conclusion I feel sad for the trolls/fanboys that have not played it and are giving it low scores.  They are not succeeding in making the game look bad\, they are only making themselves look bad.  More importantly\, they are depriving themselves of experiencing this.… Expand"

But thankfully\, he is MUCH better than in the last game we saw him. He is a cold\, stern and distant father at the start of the game. But he\, and his son Atreus\, gradually grow closer over the course of the game and I fell in love with the character all over again.And honestly\, the rest of the characters you encounter on your journey are lovable as well (or give a good reason to despise them). I also feared that Atreus would be an annoying child character that doesn't really do anything. But he's kind\, curious and eager to learn. And also knows how to use a bow.My only REAL hangup about the game would be that the setting doesn't seem entirely accurate. I'm no expert on Norse mythology here\, but most of the Gods seem to be painted to be excessively cruel and Odin seems like an even bigger dick than Zeus. Granted\, we seem to hear things from the perspective of Giants and other enemies of the Gods through shrines and other lore. Plus\, only time (and possible sequels) will tell if they are being corrupted by something like Pandora's Box from the original trilogy.In any case\, like you can see from the score this wasn't a deal breaker. It's not as if other media never gives their own spin to mythology. Even if you weren't a fan of the original games\, I'll recommend this one. It's a fresh start in a new mythological setting. Combat is over the shoulder instead of all zoomed out. So I'd say\, give it a shot! I can only hope that Santa Monica Studio can keep this up!… Expand"

I never liked Zelda or mario (which are a lot and they have to go now) games and still don't but i have never thought of it like a 0 game but in 8ish or 7ish at least because every game has something or anything that attracts you and no one has a right to gave a game like zelda or Last of Us or Uncharted or Mario or God of War or Forza or Gears of War or Halo a 0 on sites like meta because it can hurt the game sales because alot of people dpn't make their opinion but rather make theirs from other's. So few guys who game GOW-PS4 a 0 don't deserve to post their review to a site where their review can hurt the game sales (Even if the game is changed enough to look like a different game if its good then you have to give it a credit for what it does good) not that their review will matter for GOW or any other blockbuster game like Zelda or The Last of Us but still Meta people have to make something or atleast make a review score meter that starts from 5 instead of 0 for which i will be very grateful.Now for me the game is master piece\, I know graphics doesn't matter if the game is good\, but when graphics make the game more immersive\, a living breathing world then it makes the game more love able\, driven.

And yes the game doesn't have 60fps and from PC gamer's perspective it can be well all i can say it hurts more of a pride/ego rather than the play of the game when the game is not multiplayer or a racing game. So i didn't matter to me that on my ps4 pro the game wasn't reaching 60fps well to be fair graphics are more important to me as long as the game is atleast 30fps and i played it on resolution mode and i loved it and still loving it as i started on hard difficulty.So all in all it was a great experience which had after a long time\, last time i had this much fun with Horizon Zero Dawn before that with Uncharted 4 and before that with Witcher 3 PC.So thanks to Sony and the DEVs for making this great and memorable game\,… Expand"

82523,GOW2018,2018-04-20,8,"I feel the game's rather overhyped.  Objectively\, this is NOT a bad game\, in terms of technical prowess\, mechanics\, production value\, but I've wanted to quit the game on several occasions.  It's definitely NOT a bad game\, but it doesn't merit a 9 or 10 or comparisons to other great games.  First the world is very nice for the most part\, but\, some areas are extremely color-saturated andI feel the game's rather overhyped.  Objectively\, this is NOT a bad game\, in terms of technical prowess\, mechanics\, production value\, but I've wanted to quit the game on several occasions.  It's definitely NOT a bad game\, but it doesn't merit a 9 or 10 or comparisons to other great games.  First the world is very nice for the most part\, but\, some areas are extremely color-saturated and feels too cartoonish compared to the serious tone the game seems to want to set; it really bothered me on many instances.  It's as if you're playing the Last of Us\, and then suddenly the environment turns into a JRPG or WoW world.  I found it really jarring.  The combat is good; definitely better than say Witcher which had horrible combat.  Although\, however\, mechanically and control-wise it has similarities to Dark Souls and Bloodborne\, there's NO meat to the combat\, because too easy to get away from enemies simply by outdistancing.  You can also\, just keep your shield up with infinite stamina.  Also\, because you can take so much damage\, I felt no desire to master the combat.  Just roll and dodge and the enemies can hardly harm you.  Many instances\, I can tell the enemies were designed to be bad to fit the combat\, not the other way; it's really glaring and threw me sometimes.  I feel like I'm terrible with the combat because didn't want to be bothered learning\, but still end up making progress easily.  No critic that compares this combat favorably to Bloodborne or Dark Souls should be taken seriously - they simply don't know what they are talking about.I also hate puzzles in games like these.  I've spent more time doing puzzles than fighting or advancing the storyline.  Inevitably\, environmental puzzles like these become frustrating to me.  I always get stuck not because the puzzle is clever\, but because of some control mechanic that the game never bothers to explain.  Example\, at one of the bridges\, took me 30 minutes running around trying to figure out how to break a chain that I could see through a broken cage to keep a bridge down.  Well\, turned out I could hold the mechanism and throw the axe at the same time - I just didn't know the mechanics allowed me to do that.  That puzzle cost me 30 minutes of progress and frustration.  The UI is also so chock full of tiny TL;DR script.  I read and read at start\, but at some point just gave up cause none of it seem to matter.  Roll a lot and I eventually get through the enemies\, so why bother learning the tedious systems?  The level design is also extremely annoyingly-straight\, corridor-like.  I did not think it would bother me so much\, but this whole game is like that one Dark Souls 2 area where 3 foot rubble stops you from progressing.  The Corridor walls are often made of a log or a 2 ft rock that before you could climb or lift\, but now you can't because it's a invisible wall.  It's really jarring to be able to hop over one log\, but not another that looks identical; to be able to climb over a small incline in one instance\, but not in 90% of other instances- over and over and over.  The game also seems to take pride in annoying you with glimpses of chests/areas not open yet\, that you feel you should be able to open but in fact is on the next level.  The thing is you don't know if that chest or area is on the next level or on this level.  Also\, I always seem to get motion sick with certain games.  Uncharted 4 and Persona 5 made me motion sick and so does this game; I figured out why - it's whenever the game takes it upon itself to arrest camera controls away from you to show you QTE.  My brain/thumb is turning left but no\, the camera turns right.  Ugh!The other aspect of the game that is overhyped is the one long single stretch with no load screen.  Yes\, it maybe true\, but there are times when Kratos suddenly can NOT run\, and you KNOW it's loading some thing in the background.  I'd rather loading screens and have more control of my character.  Also\, every critic has stated that they do not find Atreus annoying as they feared - well\, I did - not much but I did.As I stated\, the game does NOT deserve anything less than a 7-8.  It's a very well made game\, but it also does not deserve a 9 or a 10 either.  The puzzles make the game plodding.  The customization screen is annoyingly complicated and wordy.  The linear corridor-like maps/levels grate on me- A LOT.  The combat is above-average but not the best.  A critic said this game is better than Uncharted\, Dark Souls\, Witcher\, Last of Us\, etc.\, and that it's the game of the generation.  I don't think so.  Dark Souls has better atmosphere and combat.  Last of Us has a better story and atmosphere also.  I would also say Horizon Zero Dawn had better gameplay\, characters\, world.  I do believe it's better than Uncharted and Witcher in most aspect\, however.  It's a SOLID game - but a few things annoyed me to no end.  It's worth buying at $60\, but don't go in overhyped before playing.  It's just ok\, not phenomenal.… Expand"

Its so far the best thing in the game but you have to play it at the highest difficulty to be able to get the best experience the game can offer you. It forces you to use EVERYTHING you got cuz the ennemy are brutal intelligent and powerful they wont leave you a chance and each hit can be really bad for you they always on you so you have to dodge and block in the right moment to disturb them roll behind on the right on the left back off and come back with runes attack to interrupt sometimes their attacks or just running to them jump in the air with r2 to put a powerful axe attack that can damage them. Watch your back someones coming use your shield to block it and get out of there fast and come back with a good combo. Its just a minus example of what combat in this game look like a minus... The fluidity of the combat are more advanced than any melee game in the moment when you hit you can feel each attack the controller vibrate and sometimes even the screen the developpers wanted you to feel every single attack so that SO satisfying. Majority of the skills combo moves are so great by example one of them you hold r2 and Kratos give his more powerful axe attack but you cant do that when you want you have to be sure the ennemy is stunned or not in the way to attack you cuz sometimes they take 2 second breath but not often in the most highest difficulty you need STRATEGY some attack are good in that moment some other in other moment they made you choose lot if attack depending the moment you face you got so many way to attack that the game could be 100h and it would stay diversified. Another thing you you hit the axe makes a little stop when it land on the target like in real life like that you know you just hit something instead of all the melee game you have the feeling to have not hitting anything sorry I have difficulty to explain this particularly part but I understand myself. Trowing the axes and call it back is so good the controller vibrate again and so the screen to again developpers want you to feel everything thats why that game is so intense and got perfect mecanics who top every other game in the moment. No god of war in the past had things like that combat so sophisticated brutal where you can feel each hit to give you the impression youre in a real fight when a game is such intense like that you know you got a masterpiece. SERIOUSLY i got so many other things to say about those perfecf fighting mecanics but I will never finish so thats it for that aspect....Graphic are so beautiful. The world is so huge and got different environnment forest snow lake cavern crystal vulcan and lot of other beautiful things to see. Also its the very first game were the pspro is worth it. You got option for more resolution or more frame rate. I got that same option with horizon and shadow of war but I swear it doesnt make any change but in gow the frame rate option give you so beautiful fluidity im not sure if its 60 but clearly you can see a huge difference finally with the psproCreature are great I still prefer minotaur centaur medusa cyclop but nordic mythology got some bad ass creature and im.especially talking about the huge snake WOW and when he speak is voice is so deep intense or **** I dont know the exact word but anyone who played the game know what im.talking about that was so incredible. You got lot of ennemy A LOT and for each of them you got lot of class so that make the the bestiary very complete. Im.not a fan of yellow blue orange blood but thats ok.Rpg skills xp heres the only problem with the game. You gain xp to much easily I will have all my skills before the half game... I would have loved to do two games to unlock all the skills. Your xp can not only unlocking skills but upgrading runes in your weapons. You can also upgrade lot of stat with your armor weapon and all your gear. That statistic upgrading system made me thing old classic like oblivion and diablo 2. So the rpg aspect of the game is another big huge change and improvment from the old games. Its very detailled with A LOT of choice gear runes moves and everything can be upgraded even Atreus and his bow but certainly not as Kratos.Open world well no more linear game of course its not open as a witcher or elder scroll game but a lot more open than a god of war or uncharted. You got plenty of side quest or just place to explore someplace youll have to come back cuz enemy are to powerful you go take more xp and come back. I cant write more I got 5000 character… Expand"

But I went from thinking this is a defo 10 to giving this a 9 score - in the same company as Bloodborne and Wild Hunt for example.This was a big switch from hack and slash originals (I love and finished all of them) to a game more akin to Skyrim. I liked the switch. Skyrim is probably my fav game of all time. The other genre was done and this was a welcome and unexpected change. The game has great visuals\, sounds and atmosphere. I enjoyed the general direction of the story\, some episodes could have been omitted or done differently but overall I liked it. The combat system and runic element of it were well done. RPG element was expertly designed - I spent quite a bit of time switching between different enchantments\, pommels etc. The difference between them was clear and it is usually good sign. You do not feel it is pointless.These are the reasons why it is not a 10:1) Not enough boss fights. And those that are there are not epic enough when compared to previous instalments. Should have killed a few more Gods/Norse Legends along the way.2) The worlds are sparsely populated. Could have done with more fauna and enemies.3) Gets a little bit repetitive towards the end and there is a bit of backtracking.4) Too much suffering for upgrades. I don't mind some suffering but this is too much.5) While I liked the combat system and the upgrade system associated with it in general\, it was a little too complicated. Some upgrades were useless and you never going to use them. Just confusing. Should have kept it simple. Good foundation - something ES should copy - but requires more work as combat is a big part of the game.So I give this game a 9. It was close to 10 but more work needs to be done.

Kratos has long left the world of Greek mythology and now lives among the land of Norse mythology\, with the world being heavily inspired by Northern European countries such as Iceland. The environments you will visit in your journey are jaw dropping\, with some of the best visual graphics and design to date. Kratos unlike previous entries in the series is a more mature and relatable character\, but is still the angry and scarred demi god we all know and love. Joining him in his journey is his son Atreus\, who acts as a reliable partner in combat... sometimes. The story plays out well with both protagonists developing with each other as father and son with a beautiful and memorable cinematic experience. However\, the gameplay itself is God of War's weakest new feature\, with the player left to build up an incredibly small arsenal of weapons and the questionable removal of jumping. Combat visually is impressive to begin with\, but becomes very boring very quickly with the standard enemies of the game simply doing the same light and heavy attacks with an optional shield parry. Boss battles however do not suffer the same curse\, with some of the most epic and stunning fights in the series. The only thing I found to be wrong with the boss battles are the lack of interesting Gods to fight\, with the game only offering 3 to fight with the rest being larger and more unique monsters. As a fan of the original God of War games I can only concluded that this will be a very hit and miss experience with other fans\, but I think this is the soft reset the franchise has needed for a while.

The thing about Red Dead Redemption II -- which\, I assume\, most people considered to be the main rival for the title -- is that it was genuinely groundbreaking\, laying the foundations for future open-world titles. There really wasn't anything revolutionizing about God of War\, and while it might be good game to some\, it really doesn't present anything new to the world of gaming. And I think that was the main reason why Red Dead Redemption II should've won game of the year. My score for this game (7) indicates that I still value the game\, which I of course do.

Every mechanic gets old\, especially after many sequels with the same formula are released. (Far cry\, assassin's creed etc...) By the time Ascension came out I was pretty bored of the combat\, character motivations and pretty much everything else (except for the graphics\, gore and finishing moves which this game has retained) after having played all the other titles.This game is a nice change and revives a dying franchise (and the Santa Monica studio) with an unexpected but great change of overall atmosphere\, while still making the player feel powerful after every hit\, just like in the old GoW titles. The changes were made where they needed to be made in order not to rehash just another sequel with the same formula\, and I have  got to hand it to them\, it just feels like a better and revised version of the game and the entire genre. I would say this is what other productions should try to do when making sequels. Production companies should dare to make something new and original while still keeping the feeling of one specific series of games\, instead of always rehashing the same old mechanics...Graphic is the biggest strength of this game. Shadows are always on point and at the right resolution\, a nice blurring of the edges ensures that they do not get that blockiness because of the sometimes needed lower resolutions. The most striking part is the art directions\, it just all feels like straight out of a painting. All the lights and colour correction create a unique atmosphere for every single different level\, it reminds me of The Witcher 3 in this regard.In the end I would have not given this game a 10 due to the frame rate issues at launch (which i am sure will be corrected with a patch)\, and the narrow field of view that personally bothers me in every game (ie horizon zero dawn)\, I am only doing it to counteract people giving it a 0.

The graphics are stunningly beautiful and not so repetitious that you ever get bored with them or feel that you are just seeing the same stuff\, different region. The game mechanics are intuitive - and I'm not a hack-and-slash fan by any stretch\, and the skill tree is short but powerful. Likewise\, armor and inventory management is not at all overbearing and offers genuinely useful choices that matter for the battles you are about to walk into. Music by Bear McCreary. Jeremy Davies mat be the most famous name here\, but everyone (arguably the mostly singly-deep-throated Kratos being a fairly one-note voice even though the superb facial and body animations convey emotions he is incapable or strongly reluctant to voice) is giving their A-game and just as worthy. The balance of the main character's also helps draw out emotions and motivations that might otherwise be lost. The mythology and fables shares during boat rides are interesting\, accurate\, well told\, and often charmingly funny. In fact\, that last point is important - the game knows how to throw just enough humor into the mix to not make it so dark and serious as to be completely heart=breaking or just hack-and-slash war-boy-fan material.There are only a few games that I would hold in as high regard as this one. So good I even let my daughter watch\, despite the gore\, because the story was so good.

It wears its influences on its sleeve\, taking design cues from the Souls series\, Legend of Zelda series and Horizon: Zero Dawn\, without copying or degrading them in any way. By adding these well-considered gameplay choices to a rich\, emotional story\, gorgeous setting\, and one of the best videogame relationships of all time (Kratos and Atreus)\, Santa Monica have succeeded in reinventing\, honoring and propelling the GoW series to new heights.The story is great\, original\, builds on the entirety of the franchise so far\, and opens up so many doors in terms of emotion\, mythology and character development. The Norse world is expansive\, with a lot of lore surrounding it. Thankfully Atreus captures everything in his journal\, which was actually a pleasure to read through to enrich the experience. The characters are fantastic\, with exceptional voice and motion acting. Sindri\, Brok and Mimir in particular were hilarious additions to the tale\, but the Kratos/Atreus plot is truly special. It echoes the Joel/Ellie story from Last of Us in terms of impact\, but is a lot more fraught with relatable and gripping father-son energy. The writing team nailed it from here\, and the story implications are huge in the last few hours.Gameplay is satisfying in every way\, slowly building your skills to incorporate melee\, ranged\, magic\, support\, defense and everything in between. By the end-game\, combat is exhilarating given the multitude of choices presented to you\, and always challenging. I often got my ass handed to me by some of the side mission bosses if I didn't concentrate. You can play however you like\, with armour and weapon buffs suited to your preferred attacking style. The armour also looks amazing\, with every piece unique and impeccably animated. Exploration is astounding here\, with (my favourite) collectibles behind every inch of the map. There's so much to do in the game\, you can get lost in particular sidequests which often have their own emotional weight instead of regular fetch-quests.  Treasure hunts\, freeing enslaved dragons\, arena trials\, lore collecting\, raven hunting\, all spread over a host of beautiful otherworldly locations. In particular\, I loved the side quest in which the goal was to seek out 8 corrupted super-bosses in the world. These fights were often as challenging as anything Bloodborne threw at me\, and deserve a particular mention for their cinematic challenge. Expect to die a lot\, as these foes are significantly harder than anything in the rest of the game. Related to this\, in terms of battling\, my only major gripe with the game is that a lot of storyline bosses featured QTE-style battling for their duration which was beautiful to behold\, but disappointing given how rich and capable the combat system is. It felt underutilised in the main story\, and only got its chance to shine in the more challenging optional areas/quests.Visually\, the game is absolutely amazing. The particle and lighting effects are dazzling\, and a particular shout out to the rock textures - the best I've ever seen as a geologist gamer (NEEEERRRDDDD!).I can't recommend this game enough and already can't wait for any and all DLC that may arise from here on out.

82666,GOW2018,2018-09-26,10,God of war is nothing sort of a masterpiece for the gaming industry and big step toward the future
82667,GOW2018,2018-09-26,10,"With its captivating narrative\, which is complemented by stunning visual graphics\, God of War is truly a technical masterpiece. It continues to captivate the imagination of its fans both young and old long after the initial release. Aside from its brilliantly crafted narrative and aesthetic beauty\, the free roaming camera feature combined with some welcome tweaks to the game’s leveling system and combat mechanics add a new level of immersion to the gameplay experience by giving the player the freedom of choice to level up Kratos as they see fit. Additionally\, God of War’s New Game Plus feature further enhances the experience by giving the player the opportunity to spend an additional playthrough of the campaign to acquire more advanced armor sets after completing the adventure. If you are one of those players who just wants a solid narrative driven action game this one should definitely be on your playlist. While its plot and action sequences will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the campaign\, this game will give you an unforgettable experience and leave you feeling like the true God of War after conquering your enemies.God of War’s narrative is nothing short of spectacular. Its eloquently crafted plot far exceeds the scope of a simple action adventure story and places it in the same company with games such as Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End\, The Last of Us\, and Horizon Zero Dawn. For the first time in the history of the God of War series\, Kratos is a character who is more relatable and capable of expressing more emotions than just sadness and rage. Although he is still very much a cunning warrior\, Kratos is no longer solely concerned with conquering his enemies and gaining omnipotent power. Instead\, he is a broken warrior who wants to forget about his tragic past and start a new life. Breaking away from the traditional God of War revenge plot\, this story takes the form of journey and discovery. Stylistically\, this is a brilliant move as it allows Kratos to change as a character and to convey emotions that were absent or underdeveloped in the previous installments of the series. Rather than exacting revenge on an antagonistic God\, this adventure tasks the emotionally battered Kratos to fulfill his wife’s final\, insightful wish to train their son\, Atreus\, to become a warrior as they journey to the highest mountain peak in Jötenheim to spread her ashes. Admittedly\, the most rewarding aspect of this narrative is experiencing how the relationship between Kratos and Atreus continues to develop throughout the adventure. Ultimately\, the relationship aspect of the plot makes the conclusion of the adventure more impactful and satisfying.Although this adventure’s narrative is its strongest aspect\, God of War’s gameplay also brings a lot to the table. It vividly weaves hard-hitting hack-and-slash action with elements of strategy and puzzle solving which keeps the game from becoming monotonous\, repetitive\, or predictable. A redefined free roaming camera system along with new combat and armor crafting features help reshape how God of War is played while keeping the appreciated core gameplay mechanics intact. The unrestricted camera also adds a new facet to the gameplay as it gives you the ability to focus on individual enemies and objects. With that being said however\, this new feature also adds an additional challenge as it forces you to become more aware of your surroundings tasking you to utilize the camera to defeat enemies who hide in blind spots. Although controlling the camera can prove to be a difficult task initially\, once you have mastered how to utilize the camera in battle\, it becomes one of your greatest tools and can be used to defeat tougher enemies in the advanced stages of the game.God of War’s character leveling system has also gotten a much-needed overhaul as well. While this leveling system still resembles the one used in the game’s prior installments\, the new combat mechanics and armor crafting adds a welcomed layer of customization to the system.  The old leveling system was more primitive and restricted how many magic attacks could be upgraded. The new system allows you to upgrade dozens of magic attacks\, armor sets\, and weapons while giving you the freedom to swap in and out these items based on the situation.The combat system has also been overhauled as well. This is immediately evident once you realize that you can no longer simply combat-role to avoid incoming enemy attacks. Additionally\, the new combat mechanics eliminates the possibility of mindlessly flailing away at enemies with the Blades of Chaos. To defeat a barrage of enemies\, many situations will require you to utilize the Leviathan Axe or the Spartan Shield. While at times switching between these three weapons can be difficult\, it feels exceptionally rewarding after slashing through an army of Hel-Reavers or chopping down a mighty Valkyrie!… Expand"

The older games in my opinion were more brutal and violent\, but this one took a step back\, but still maintains the perfect amount of violence and brutality. And it also tells one of the best stories this generation. Kratos is back\, this time accompanied by his son\, Atreus. The journey is also different from the last games in that\, Kratos isn't looking for vengeance\, but instead he is in a journey with his son to fulfill his wife's last wishes by scattering her ashes at the tallest peak of all the realms. This father and son adventure is memorable and emotional filled with excitement.The gameplay is also different\, but it feels so good especially once you get better at the game because it is difficult\, but you learn and grow and adapt this different combat system. And once you get the hang of it\, it just feels so good especially once you start taking on and defeating the secret bosses.This game is just beautiful to look at and play.

82733,GOW2018,2018-04-25,10,"A brief expedition into Norse Mythology and I walk away feeling complete.God of War has always been one of my top favorite game series of all time. That being said\, I went into this game fully expecting to dislike everything about it. I abhorred the idea of them changing everything about the series I love. Why take away my blades?? Giving me an axe in the process? Changing the camera angle of the classic\, tried and true games? The changes they implemented were vast in terms of comparison to previous games.Even after all of that though\, from the moment I picked up the game\, I spent every waking minute of the next three days drowning in the beauty that it offered. 64 hours from arrival to 100% completion and platinum trophy.This game offered me everything I wanted from God of War. It gave us incredible visuals. The best in current games on the market? Probably not. Did it need to be best? Not one single bit. The graphics we're just one piece of the puzzle that made this game click. The story was immersive and gripping. I found myself just waiting to find out what happened next. It lacked a little in terms of story expansion\, but thinking about the future is the key!They set up the next game so perfectly. We learned about the characters in this one. We learned who was who\, their purpose\, and the basis of all Norse Mythology (Ragnarok). Who found out who the antagonist was and we got a lesson on what will happen within the next 2 games. (And the extra added min-clip when you visit your house after story completion tells us what will happen in the next game).One would've hoped that Thor's sons would've been harder to beat\, but you're the GHOST OF SPARTA! They're just wimpy little mini-gods who got in your way\, and you're willing to take them down in order to fight Thor next time.As far as end game content goes\, I feel this is where the game lacks the most. Platinum wasn't horribly difficult (in my opinion) and there's only so many waves of Niflheim/Muspelheim you can do before you get a little bored. The biggest upside of the end game content though was the Queen Valkyrie. She is TOUGH to beat when you consider her use of the other Valkyrie's attacks.Despite endgame content and no current NG+\, the game is still a resounding 10 for me. They hit all the bases and went above and beyond at supplying us with a story that grips you and holds you until the very end.I cannot wait to see what Cory Barlog has in store for the next games\, and I'll be first in line to pre-order as soon as it's released!… Expand"

Pertenece a la aclamada saga *God of War* .Conocido por su sanguinario protagonista\, y saber como entretener al espectador a la hora de jugar\, las entregas de esta franquicia funcionan mas como Arcades con algo de sub-trama de fondo... Pero aquí\, ese no es el caso.En God of War (2018)\, tenemos personajes totalmente humanos\, con personalidades plasmadas y arcos argumentales muy bien desarrollados\, nos alejamos totalmente de la frenética violencia gratuita a la que nos tenia acostumbrado los demás títulos de la saga. Aquí\, todo ello es sustituido por momentos complejos y dramáticos\, emociones realistas y una historia la cual es bastante solida.Este juego nos demuestra a un Kratos viejo\, triste\, vulnerable\, lleno de lamentos y sin motivos por el cual seguir viviendo...excepto su hijo. Ambos van en búsqueda de llevar las cenizas de su madre a su lugar mas deseado antes de morir\, y allí\, es donde se basa todo el viaje y la aventura que acompañara a nuestros dos protagonistas.Éste es un excelente juego\, ya que a lo largo de todo nuestro viaje\, se nota la evolución de Kratos y su hijo\, demostrando lo bien escritos y construidos que están como personajes. Desafortunadamente (y hablando de personajes) uno de los puntos mas débiles del juego fue su Villano principal\, el cual es carente de creatividad\, intimidación y originalidad... Incluso los demás monstruos y seres que nos encontramos a lo largo del juego\, hubieran funcionado mejor para este rol. En cuanto a los demás personajes secundarios\, en su mayoría me parecen excelentes.God Of War utiliza exactamente la misma metodología de jugabilidad\, y planos cinematográficos que el clásico *The Last of Us* \, aunque esto no es necesariamente malo\, resta considerablemente puntos en la parte de originalidad.Éste juego podría considerarse el *LOGAN* de la franquicia\, ya que se aleja de la acción frenética\, aventura genérica y personajes poco desarrollados.... Y nos enfoca en temas como la vejez\, la familia\, el perdón y la auto-superación. No es un titulo perfecto\, pero a mi parecer\, es sin dudas el mejor de toda la saga.Jugabilidad: 9/10Personajes: 9/10Historia: 7/10Diseño: 8.5/10Entretenimiento: 8.5/10… Expand"

However\, some glaring issues makes the experience a frustration.1) The axe throwing puzzles. It gets old really really fast. And especially the Norn chests. Even when you know what you're suppose to do\, it's an exercise in frustration. The timing windows are far too narrow.2) There are no invincibility frames in this game\, which means you can get STUNLOCKED by multiple enemies and die without any way to get out of it. God of War tries to become more Souls-like\, without the tight responsive control and the core mechanics of Souls games. When you die in Souls\, you know you messed up. Here\, it's just frustration as a dodge that should have worked doesn't\, because just the bare edge of the attack catches you\, or you dodged into an obstacle because of the camera.3) Speaking of the camera\, it's the WORST. You can't see where the enemies are coming at you and dodge/parry\, and the threat indicators are extremely poorly designed and you can't tell which direction the enemy is coming from. God of War should take cues from Middle Earth on how combat should work with multiple enemies. Again\, like Souls\, in Middle Earth\, if you fail to parry/dodge\, you always know it's your mistakeIt's a fantastic game that I would recommend\, as long as you can bear with the glaring issues stated above.… Expand"

The graphics are phenomenal\, from claustrophobic caves to lush forests to vast oceans and mountain ranges\, you never feel bored of your stunning surroundings. I was apprehensive of the new Leviathan axe\, Kratos' new primary melee weapon\, however the progression system for moves and abilities as well as the enhancements you can make to the Leviathan axe\, not to mention Atreus' bow\, keep you very much engaged and working towards the next upgrade. You can also throw down and go bare knuckles if you please\, which like the axe\, rage and Atreus' bow has it's own skill tree. Kratos and Atreus also have several armor options to aid them on their journey and enhance certain play styles. Kratos' son Atreus proves to be a vital asset in the game and is essential for progressing through the story as well as aiding in fights. The fighting is varied and fluid\, with a wide variety of moves and many types of enemies to practice on including some epic boss battles\, but there are also the slow points when Kratos takes the time to tell his son a story whilst they paddle across the Lake of the Nine or the two take in their surroundings giving the player time to do the same. There are unique places to discover and many puzzles throughout the realms\, some requiring you to return later in the game when your and your weapons abilities have grown. There is so much detail to each area\, and the developers encourage exploration from the start\, allowing the player to truly appreciate each place as they progress through the game. With many side-quests\, you can follow the main story or branch out and explore the greater world\, allowing for ultimate freedom during your play through.

The brutality is still there\, but Kratos is now more deliberate with his strikes. One will definitely love the feel of the Leviathan Axe returning to Kratos' hand. Atreus is a key aspect of the game and combat as well; he is not some \""dumb AI\"" you just leave to die - he actually becomes very useful once you get used to him\, and it would serve you well to invest on the boy's skills.If you haven't bought this game yet\, then don't be sorry. Be better. Buy it\, boy!… Expand"

It's pretty evident that alot of passion and difficult choices went into developing this game.I will try to write this review as short as possible.My short opinion: I really enjoyed this game. My enjoyment score would be a 10. However\, as you can see\, I didn't give it a 10\, since a reviewer needs to be as objective as possible(even though this review will contain a lot of subjectivity).The story was entertaining. The way it was presented was interesting as well(no cuts). My only small problem was the pacing. The pacing felt off during certain moments. I don't want to spoil anything about the story and it is just me being nit picky since it isn't a consistent problem.Kratos is also a lot more interesting compared to the previous installments. He isn't one dimensional and you can see him grow as a character as the story progresses. Atreus isn't annoying as well and IMO compliments well with this \""new\"" Kratos. Every other characters are interesting and are not \""boring\"".Level design is just excellent. The levels are linear\, but it has different \""branches\"" to explore. Those branches looks interesting and are well thought out. The levels itself looks beautiful. I've played the game on challenge mode without HUD on a FAT PS4 and it is in my opinion the best looking game this generation for the PS4.Sound is like most games good. The music depends on preferences. Voice acting is well done as well. It's on par with other story driven games.Game mechanics:- Combat is well done and has actual depth now. It isn't \""button mashy\"". You also have another option to approach the enemies. Instead of depleting their health\, you can try to increase their stagger bar to \""one shot\"" them with an execution move which is as satisfying as the previous installments. The rage mode also feels more satisfying(a tleast to me).My only problem is that I do miss the jump button. This may however only be a problem for the fans who has played the previous installments.It also has more RPG elements. Instead of just upgrading your weapons like the previous games\, it also gives you the option to customize it(aka making it more personal). Kratos and Atreus can also wear \""armors\"" and they are customizable as well.Puzzles are also nice and not too difficult. It doesn't take too long to figure out a puzzle\, yet it feels satisfying when you solve it. This however may depend on the players and how \""experience\"" you are with puzzles in general.The perspective of the camera depends on preferences. I've heard people not liking it\, but also people having no problem with the camera angle. From my experience\, I had no problem as well and prefer this camera because it's more \""personal\"". But again\, it depends on your preference.Performance is most of the time consistent. I only had like 3 times of small frame drops.… Expand"

The story is well developed\, with central characters that are written well enough to feel memorable and tie you to the world and set pieces that take place. Dialogue during slower sections can often be repetitive in games\, but in this\, it is masterfully used to further develop characters and the lore. Arteus is not a burden but a useful ally\, and arguably the central figure to the games plot. It is detailed in its menus\, without feeling overbearing.My only legitimate disappointments come from everything outside of this main campaign. The side quests and open world design do not suit the linearity and cinematic brilliance of the main campaign. I felt that the game promises more than it actually delivers\, as it lacks the enemy variety\, characters and interesting locations to uphold what it sets out to achieve. Too often do you find yourself traversing the same places.Even so\, for the main campaign alone\, God of War is a great game.… Expand"

The acting\, the graphics\, the music\, the fighting mechanics are so smooth and the skill trees are easy to understand.  The armor upgrading is less clear\, especially as there are limited resources\, you can get lost.  But that's related to where it truly fails\, in its \""open world\"" and end game integration into/alongside the core story.  I had never played any of the God of War games as I'm not into linear story games.  I love open world.  So when I started seeing it being referred to as open world by many reputable game sites along side high reviews\, I went all in.  Unfortunately\, it is NOT a true open world.  It's a hub world which is very different\, and there are different strategies\, especially depending where you are on the spectrum in terms of 100% competition.  I don’t need 100%\, but I absolutely love some side quests to flesh out the story and to amp my power FOR the end battle which is typical of open world. That's not really how this game is built\, and had I know that\, a lot of angst and feelings of time drain could have been avoided in scaling my strategy appropriately.  This was compounded by some really bad time estimates that were handed out.The sides story wise are fantastic.  The way the boat time is handled\, the character development\, it’s all really good.  The fantastic character development in the extras makes me want the sides in the middle\, as paced out between core story plot points/battles delivers the most emotional satisfaction.  But fight wise\, it doesn’t work at all.  I felt like many of the sides were built as post game content (judging by level of fights to main story rewards)\, but available early without a good map.  It was a struggle to find the appropriate level of side activity.  Even the few in game hints weren’t reliable depending.  If you tried to do everything as it became an open area\, you’d be running into easy fights right next door be way too hard.  Trying to explore just got really frustrating with lots of walls.   Some backing off or recrossing areas if fine\, but it was too often.  Also note nothing re spawns either\, so if you get 2/3rds through an area before having to back off for any reason (such as not having a locked weapon)\, it's boring coming back and just feels draining.  Plus\, that amazing background story telling caps out eventually and things don’t respawn\, so if you didn’t hit everything just right\, you can have some really quiet and boring completionism questing if you want 100%.  If you do push through higher level sides\, you also end up making the bosses rather pitiful. Unbalanced sides (to current story point) really undermined the core “high” points.Some advocate just doing all the sides at the end to avoid a lot of that\, but then you really miss out on the reward of it from an XP/gear perspective and miss the character growth immersion alongside the core story.  You could switch around the challenge level but that throws you out of being immersed.   There is one extra tough side boss\, the Valk Queen\, and had just the Valks been the end game content and made truly only available at the end (or guided to wait on them)\, the balance would have been better.  Still provide an optional “extra hard” bonus for those that desire the fighting over story\, but even then\, the reward from the Valks has ZERO use right now beyond karma points\, unless they add a +New Game.Basically\, the core of the game\, story and execution were great.  But they missed on what an open world was\, or missed in letting it be advertised as such.  Even as a hub\, appropriate map/narrative leads or respawning of monsters and materials to keep the quests fun exploring rather than an unfun gated maze is missing.  The core story is a 10/10\, I do hope they can improve on this one area and get the next installment as a whole there.… Expand"

This installment has several errors which prevents this game to dethrone the crown jewel of the series\, also helmed by Balrog\, God of War 2. GOW2 sported catching visuals and animations\, tight storytelling\, visceral combat so a thrill from the get go till the very end. All of these focused like a coherent laser beam and fed to the gamer intravenously. No distractions\, just the gist: limbs flying\, jaws droppin.This reboot is also perfect aesthetically\, it’s visuals are stunning\, got the usual over the top content\, though far less pleasing than it’s predecessors. The combat is sadly sub-par\, some of the enemies sport kinda strange movesets (The ancients)\, like they are straight from a Transformers movie and there are serious problems balance wise because of the unneeded RPG elements in the game. You can customise your armour\, your weapons and the more time you spend with completing the numerous side quests the better gear you get and more experience you can spend on special abilities. The problem is… If you complete most of the side quests and then continue the main questline… well\, then you will be way overpowered and will toss the enemies to the side like your used underwear. I just kinda scratched my head when level 6 enemies (realm tear Hel reavers) can be killed at level 2 or with an overpowered Atreus you can kite them and come out victorious. Also you kinda feel overwhelmed by the numerous enchantments\, sockets and other RPG esque content. This doesn’t add anything besides several hours of mostly repetitive gameplay content which perfectly kills the game balance. GOW never was a full blown RPG like Witcher\, but the creators strived to make it one\, and failed. Well\, please forget about this nonsense. God of War was always about perfect storytelling\, over the top combat\, tearing enemies apart limb by limb and not fiddling about idiotic gemstones\, enchantments and other Wow style never ending RPG content. Just one big hell of a march. Of Course Santa Monica will not tear this newly introduced gameplay element from the game\, but it should tone it down to a level where it is acceptable. What about putting chests where content deserves and not literally everywhere. When I saw another chest in the middle of the game kinda felt like throwing up. Uhh\,  the 257th chest\, it will contain another used garment… Game elements like these are overused and in overall the content - especially the bosses - isn’t that tight like we used to be. Too much creative sauce went down the drain because of the newly introduced RPG elements.It’s very hard to balance a game where it’s up to the user which path to choose. The original GOW games felt absolutely perfect\, because all you had to do is move\, fight and watch the content in awe. Now you have to do the same with several distractions. So if you want a pleasurable gameplay experience\, do not fiddle with the side quests too much\, just do the main storyline. Kratos went through some minor brainwashing to please the masses and he also got a tie and a suit and has to wear it because sales numbers or who knows why. This franchise needs some extra love. More monsters\, more tactical and harder combat\, less mouth feeding\, less borrowing from famous franchises\, more and varied gore... so fixing\, a lot.… Expand"
82819,GOW2018,2018-05-15,9,"God of War is truly a great game.

The different enemies and their own different abilities has been very well thought over\, like with the Travellers\, Valkyries and all the other many different beasts and their own abilities. Yes you will come across the same type of enemy but they are different\, they will have different ways to damage and kill them\, along with their unique different attack and defensive styles.The amount of detail in the game is fantastic and the overall look of the world/realms look stunning. The game runs smoothly without any bugs/glitches that I’ve come across. The story has been very well written and the voice acting is amazing. The combat is great fun with many different abilities and skills to master. The Leviathan axe feels powerful and strong. You can upgrade your axe with many different abilities to suit your own play style and add different runic attacks from light to heavy. Then you get another weapon\, I won’t spoil nothing! Let’s just say you get an old friend back! And you can upgrade them with their own abilities. The armour is great with many different types of armours to find or purchase and they can be upgraded to again suit your play style with many different enchantments to attach to each piece of armour\, from chest\, wrist and waist.Atreus has his own armour and bow abilities to upgrade along with his runic summon ability. He does not have the same level of customisation and upgrades to that of Kratos\, but it’s no issue.My only grumbles with the game is with the non retuning enemies when you back track and with the sometimes annoying back chat Atreus gives you\, the typical child who thinks they know best and are an adult kinda thing. However his attitude/back chat does decline after Kratos has the talk with him.I was a little concern to the new look and style of the camera and more so\, the combat. I am a hardcore GoW and Kratos fan and enjoyed all of the previous GoW games\, with GoW 3 being my favourite game in the franchise. At some parts in the game it didn’t feel like a GoW game\, more of a walking\, rowing and talking game. Their are no way near the amount of enemies in this game that should have been. You can walk a fair bit to come across 3 or 4 of the standard small enemies or 1 large enemy and 3 or 5 smaller ones. This was my only issue along with the zero enemies when you return to an area that you have cleared.It is different to all the previous GoW games but that’s not a bad thing\, not at all. It’s just a new style that does work very well. If you’re a GoW fan\, you should buy this\, it’s a great follow up story from Kratos’ past.All-in-all I’d give God of War a solid 9.5/10I think if you’re a gamer that enjoys a good story with great gameplay and combat\, then you’ll enjoy this! This game is NOT “over hyped” at all. It has the 10/10s for a very good reason\, because it is a 10/10 game\, for me it’s 9.5. I think a lot of salty Xbox fanboys are just trying to hate on a game purely because it’s a PlayStation exclusive\, had it only been an Xbox exclusive\, you’d see them giving it a 10/10 too! But because they own the Xbox nONE xclusives\, they hate it and will give it poor “reviews”.So my closing thoughts are; buy this great game\, it’s one of the best games that has ever come out on any PlayStation console\, and any console/PC and is up there with Horizon: Zero Dawn\, Uncharted 4 and The Last Of Us remastered! Own it now\, enjoy it and lose many\, many hours of your life in a fantastic game!… Expand"

Tenia mucho miedo de que al cambiar la mitología en la que se había basado todas sus anteriores versiones\, se equivocasen y el juego deje de ser GoW.

82824,GOW2018,2018-05-20,8,"It’s different from the other god of war games I’ve played\, at first I disliked how the combat looked but then I played it for myself and fell in love with the whole game. The combat isn’t your regular hack and slash from previous god of war games\, but that doesn’t make it any less fun\, the graphics are good and I never got any fps drops throughout the whole game while playing on the regular PS4\, the environment is beautiful and you learn more about the story the more you explore. Which brings me to the reason it’s a 8  and not a 10\, the story in general is pretty much taking a pouch of Kratos’s wife’s ashes to the highest peak and spread it\, and fighting Baldur a long the way and that’s it. You meet 3 or 4 people  a long the way who aren’t very interesting and you have to do a lot of exploring and boat rowing to find out more about the characters in the world and the lore behind them\, I said a lot of boat rowing because mimir tells a lot of stories about the gods when you guys are in the boat. I find sitting in the boat listening to mimirs stories more interesting than running around with ashes trying to throw them from the highest peak. So the game is short and doesn’t take long to finish when focusing on the main objective\, exploring and doing side activities will take up most of your time. The game took me 2-3 days to 100% complete and platinum. It’s a great game and I hope they do more for the story in the next god of war.Pros - Great combat system\, the environment is beautiful\, good graphics and good frame rate\, the more is very interesting and you get a funny head to travel with later in the game.Cons - The main story/objective isn’t interesting at all\, main story is short\, the other characters you meet are boring and you have to spend a decent amount of hours exploring and boat rowing in order to learn more about the lore and story behind some of the gods mentioned in the game.… Expand"

I liked how the team was able to set this character into a different mythology and despite the fact i don't know much about the Norse mythology\, the game could keep up my attention all the time and it also teached me some good stories and introduced interesting characters about this world. The chemistry between Kratos and Atreus works well\, but i think the media and the press pushed this relationship a bit over the top. Sure\, they make a really good dad and son pair\, but this kind of interaction just worked better in The Last of Us. (in my opinion) The graphics is top notch\, i don't think i have to explain this any further. Just take a look on the game and you will see\, it's easily the best looking game nowadays. Combat system felt ok\, i really don't mind the change of the camera perspective and this one shot technique is greatly carried out. Loved the moments when the past 'gives a warming welcome' and this non-linear\, but still corridor shaped level design is really interesting through all realms. Characters are ok\, i loved the act of Christopher Judge\, but in my opinion Jeremy Davies as Baldur really stole the show!!! This game deserve all the love it gets from the fans\, i'm very happy for the fact that it's such a huge success\, especially in these times when everything is about the multiplayer shooters and lootboxes -.-I would like to point out one more perspective which i didn't understand during the advertising campaign. People were excited/upset because how a cruel\, barbarian Spartan became such a p.ssy and why we have to play as a babysitter now\, instead of killing everything what moves. Don't you forget\, across all games\, there were many emotional scenes\, this game was always like this\, but now it is just a bit more in the foreground. Kratos always suffered from the things what he had done\, never wanted to be a monster like as we see during action\, but this is his fate\, regardless he accepting it or not. (Yes\, SPOILER STARTS here\, but just take a look on the scene where Athena shows up\, or the other scene in Hel. SPOILER ENDS)Loved the game very much\, i can't wait for the sequel.

For its time\, the game was brilliant both in terms of gameplay and in terms of portraying a deeper story than typical action games\, over-the-top gore and silly sex mini-games notwithstanding.

For its time\, the game was brilliant both in terms of gameplay and in terms of portraying a deeper story than typical action games\, over-the-top gore and silly sex mini-games notwithstanding. The game spawned two main sequels\, and several side-quels/prequels\, finally culminating in God of War III\, by which point Kratos had basically killed everything in Greek mythology.Now\, however\, the team has brought him back\, some decades later\, aging\, and with a kid to raise on his own\, having just lost his wife. Also\, he's somehow come from Ancient Greece to Midgard (shortly before the beginning of Ragnarok). Fans of my books will find some similarities in interpretation of the setting\, though only some.While the original games were great\, I'm going to come straight out and say the new game\, also titled God of War\, outstrips all of them in terms of both gameplay and story.And I'm not just saying that because I'm the \""Norse mythology guy.\""I actually like Greek mythology as much or more than Norse. But this time\, the team has taken a fresher spin on the myths for reasons beyond simply justifying Kratos needing to kill Heracles or whatever. Plus\, both the character and the story have matured. Kratos still has the rage inside of him\, but now he knows how destructive that rage can be to himself and everyone around him. He knows vengeance isn't going to solve anything.But he's still willing to kill anything and everything that stands in the way of his goals.However\, he's also dealing with the pain of losing his wife (and yes\, I know the same was true in the first game) and of trying to raise a child to be better than he was.In terms of gameplay\, God of War takes some definite cues from Dark Souls\, probably enough to qualify for the Souls-like genre. Which is great\, considering that style of challenging but rewarding ARPG has become my definitive favorite genre in recent years. A few aspects of the game feel like the old ones\, including the occasional puzzle (which I didn't feel added much to the game\, save nostalgia for one aspect I didn't miss in the first place). The combat feels a bit different than either Souls or old school GOW\, but\, basically\, it's a system that punishes mistakes while rewarding mastery of the mechanics and learning enemy fighting styles.Kratos--for the first time\, unless I'm mistaken--now has to block attacks on a shield\, which is incredibly important here\, as it also allows parries. Oh\, and he lays into his foes with a big ass axe that returns when he throws it\, ala Thor's hammer in the Marvel movies. Most of the time\, enemies can down Kratos in a few hits if you get careless or too aggressive. On the other hand\, when you get a rhythm going\, Kratos feels like\, well\, a god of war.While the game does feature some platformer-ish exploration\, there's far less platformer challenges to this one. Meaning--praise the Aesir--nothing quite so irritating as the underworld spinning blade columns.All this said\, it shouldn't surprise you to hear I loved this game. If you own a PS4\, get this game.… Expand"

An Axe\, a Promise and a Fury the likes of which the Northren Realms have never seen before. Turn that first page with Kratos and Atreus and you'll love every step you walk with them.… Expand"

I do hope however that Loki will pick up every weapon he can find in the next game and not just use his bow.- Boss battle are great but they need to be more like the first boss with the stranger (Baldur). It was the best boss battle and action scene I've ever witnessed in my life.- Music\, they sing in old norse. GREAT IDEA AND IT SOUNDS AWESOME!- Armor\, weapon and fighting variety with high quality.- Open world are not too small or too big (with nothing explore).

Top notch script writing. The voice actors are incredible\, their delivery was believable\, and I felt engaged with the story. Atreus (the son) seemed JUST like a kid\, and his little snide remarks about their journey had me cracking up.Example: A dwarf grabs Kratos’s axe and says he’s going to upgrade it\, and Atreus says bewilderedly “...but we didn’t ask you to.” (Just play it - it’s much funnier in context)Another Example:  Atreus wants to help someone they met on their travels and Kratos doesn’t want to\, so he says\, “Well\, if mom were here\, she would help the.” Kratos pretends he didn’t hear that and angrily asks\, “What was that!?” Atreus says\, “uhhh nothing.” Kratos says\, “Yeah\, that’s what I thought...” (there are a lot of little moments like that throughout.I particularly enjoy when Atreus is excited about his surroundings\, acting like a typical little kid and Kratos gets impatient and annoyed.While they’re in the boat\, Atreus asks Kratos to tell him a story and Kratos responds with the tortoise and the hare. Kratos: “There was a story about a tortoise and a hare. They wager on a race between them. The hare is too confident of victory and is foolish\, while the hare is steady and disciplined. The tortoise wins.”  Atreus: “You... *chuckles* haven’t told a lot of stories\, have you?”The relationship between Kratos and his son are the best part of the story. I felt invested in the game and that rarely happens to me in games.I highly recommend this game. It’s easily among Uncharted 4 and The Last of Us Remastered as far as quality goes. This game could be competing for the best PS4 exclusive of this generation.… Expand"

And Jesus Christ\, this game is amazing\, so far\, it has my GAME OF THE YEAR spot in my list for this year. The visuals are amazing on this game\, and the interaction Atreus has with Kratos\, even though they are brief and make you think they're emotionless from part of Kratos\, the game makes you feel that Kratos deeply cares about his child. The game mechanics are stunning\, with the new combat system\, it changes by your progress through the game\, unlocking new ways to **** some Norse creatures up. I haven't beaten the story yet by how long it is\, but I've been playing for about 3 days now and I don't think I'm halfway through it\, the characters are actually likeable and are easy to remember because they all have an impact to the story. Another thing that I love is how semi-open world this game is\, and it is probably the first time in my gaming history that I've enjoyed looting\, I NEED to check every corner of the map because I want to increase my chances of getting new gear and finding more Hacksilver to upgrade my gear. Another thing I liked is how well the RPG elements on this game works\, they are just fantastic and you feel you get stronger every time you get new equipment. The takedowns on the monster can sometimes get repetitive\, but since there are a lot of different enemy types\, the takedowns never get old\, no matter how many times you see them (but that's just my opinion at least).

Isn't it for kids? They would question me. For a while now i kind of came to my senses that they might be right on this one. BUT\, GOD OF WAR changed it for me.GOD OF WAR. You beautiful bastard. This is my answer!Yes. Its that good. Who cares about Half Life 3 anymore.. I got this game and its more than sufficient.The first thing you're going to notice in this game is the Godly amount of polish that went into making it. Everything is shown in a single shot and it never cuts. Thus keeping you on the edge of your seat. One epic moment leads to another and the next thing you know is that you just spent the last five hours on a single gaming session. Time just flies. Combat in this game is more mature\, gory and brutal. No more hack and slash since Kratos will take damage. So\, you'll need to defend yourself at all times. \""The Stranger\"" Boss fight was the one that got me hooked which is about 90 mins into the game. The Badassery that was dispalyed by this Boss and the Tsunamic combat with him was an experience which is out of this world. The pacing is also something that needs to commended here since there are quieter and lighter moments after every major fight and Kratos's son Atreus will accompany him by keeping thing fresh with a lively banter plus the change of scenery and music really keeps things moving. The sound & Music is sublime here. Every detail from the sound of Kratos Beefy punch to the music that plays in the background is stunning and perfect. Coming to the next Best thing is the Graphics in this game. Every detail and animations starting from the rocks and trees breaking apart when Kratos throws his apponents against them to the pristine texture quality of objects like trees\, terrain and vegetation is astonishing. I'am really. How can this run on a PS4 is baffling my mind. Lastly the Story. Let me just say one thing. The least i say about it the better it is for you. Its superb is all i can tell you.God of War is like a well oiled machine. Everything thing from its Story\, Gameplay\, Graphics and Sound come together mixed in with an secret X factor recipe to give you an experience like no other and i don't say that lightly.  Hats off to Santa Monica Studios for pouring in their godly effort\, sweat\, tears and blood into making this Game and then putting it out there for everyone to experience. I highly doubt that there will be any other studio beating this game for a long time. I say Thank you from the bottom of my heart to Cory Barlog and Santa Monica Studios! You made me a gamer all over again and you also refortified my belief on one more important thing. Do what you Love and do it like you're Life depended on it and the fruits of your labour will be on the same epic proportions as GOD OF WAR!﻿… Expand"

Little details like that really stand out.Gameplay:What I probably appreciate most are the improvements to combat. Once you master the parry\, side-step and roll you'll be able to maneuver through combat situation with ease. Add to that hard-hitting attacks\, both light and heavy\, the ability to continue a combo from a dodge (yes please) the ability to call back your axe during an attack and the ability to break an enemies defense\, despite the level of challenge this game really lets you feel powerful.

The downside to the Naughty Dog formula howeverGod of War is a game that finally manages to strike a near perfect balance between narrative story telling and gameplay. I have been saying for years that game studios could learn a lot by following the Naughty Dog formula of game design; mainly incredible storytelling and characters\, as well as highly detailed\, beautiful\, believable worlds. The downside to the Naughty Dog formula however has always been gameplay. Games like The Last of Us and Uncharted tend to feel like gameplay wrapped around a narrative experience. This often leaves something to be desired in the games mechanics. Don't get me wrong\, Naughty Dog makes some of the greatest games of all time and are certainty no slouch when it comes to gameplay\, however they tend to fall slightly short in what is capable for a modern AAA game.God of War on the other hand feels more like a narrative experience wrapped around solid gameplay. The slider hasn't moved perfectly in the right direction\, but it's close. I think it's evidence that that ND formula works\, and works extremely well.My only major complaint about God of War is that much of the narrative was quickly tied off to close up holes in the story and that much of the character development (especially in regards to Ateus) was clearly meant as a setup for future sequels. There is nothing wrong with leaving some loose ends to transition into a sequel\, however much of Atreus' character arch is left in the dark\, coming quickly to a not completely satisfying conclusion.

The story keeps you thinking about what is happening constantly and having finished\, the journey was more than worth the excellent ending.Anyone who tries to say the camera doesn't work just doesn't understand something or simply hasn't played to any extent. If you're worried about dying from behind\, don't be. I have beaten the game and lots of side content on give me GOW and almost never die from behind because only a simple understanding of the enemy allows you to dodge attacks from all angles from feel alone even without UI if you like\, The close up camera makes the combat very strategic and forces you to keep moving\, in a good way.Enemies feel great in this game. I've had so much fun learning all the actions of the enemies and it has had real affects on my game play. The game gives you so much room to master and feel like you've conquered stuff. Boss fights are not repetitive and anyone who says this didn't play the game. Yes there is lots of trolls\, but they all have some twist to them and you even fight 2 at once which was one of the best fights. All the other bosses are amazing and like the enemies leave tons of room to learn and conquer.The world is absolutely amazing. Backtracking never feels like a chore because there's always some new sight to see or thing to collect for a long time.The crafting\, runic attacks\, enchantments and all that are not super deep but just enough to allow you to make real builds and use different tools for different encounters. Endgame realms have to you doing challenges and traversing a maze so you will need to switch things up and swap certain items. Sure it's not the best crafting and armor system by any means but if embraced adds the perfect little layer of creativity to your kratos that goes a long way.A lot of the negative reviews are blatant attempts of slander with many people making it painfully obvious they didn't play much if at all. I totally understand trying to make a grounded review but the 0 reviews on this game are nothing but a sad attempt to deface an excellent game over a stupid console war.… Expand"

This game is all about the journey between kratos and his son. The combat is new and refreshing\, but it doesn't abandon fans of the series\, as the more you unlock\, the more nostalgia there is. The main missions consist of combat\, light puzzle solving\, and traversal. It blends each and everyone one of those elements together perfectly. The lore of the norse mythology is interesting\,  and i know nothing of it coming in. The story kept me on my feet\, and the more lore I got from exploring\, the more interested I became of the story. I also LOVED the \""metroidvania\"" elements of this game\, perhaps the best one I've seen in an AAA game? All the chests that requires looking for symbols were diverse and fun as heck to solve.  I must've loot every little thing there was\, and none of them felt like a waste of time. Speaking of which there are rpg elements in this game\, it's light\, but i felt like it was a welcome addition to game (armor\, perks\, enchantments\, stats\, etc). in addition to rpg elements\, there is an small open world to explore\, it's no gta\, but the islands in midgard are all very diverse and interesting\, quality over quantity. Side quests are also of the quality over quantity scale in this game\, treasures to look for\, dragons to free\, realms to close\, everything about this game was just grand in quality. The characters in this game were all amazing\, amazing graphics\, fun combat\, fun exploring\, I can't stop gushing about this game. Again\, disregard anyone who says this isn't god of war\, the highs in this game are one of the highest there is in gaming as per usual in any gow game. i got at least 25-35 hours in one playthrough with decent side activity\, and I'm going back in to do more. Thank you\, Sony Santa Monica studios!… Expand"

Sin embargo no por ello dejo de ser critico con los desarrolladores en cuanto a determinadas decisiones que han tomado a lo largo de la serie.. Ciertamente God of War presentaba un desgaste en algunos aspectos como la jugabilidad y una historia forzada (Caso Ascensión) \, que insinuó el fin del ciclo de Kratos.Sin embargo este reinicio con Cory Barlog liderando la reinvención del juego\, ha tomado un giro más adulto  y amplio\, al incorporar nuevos elementos y géneros de videojuegos\, sin perder su esencia fundamental. Gráficos muy bien elaborados (con pocas excepciones)\, una historia que genera expectativas de continuidad \, sistema de combate renovado y un poco mas estratégico\, elementos novedosos de rol a la medida que aportan profundidad\, nuevo posicionamiento de cámara mas cercano y personal\, gran variedad de herramientas y menús de opciones y momentos cargados de suspenso y acción épica.Definitivamente\, ningún juego es perfecto\,  todos tienen errores y la evolución es inminente eimpostergable. Pero las valoraciones que se le otorgan a uno y a otro dependerá en gran medida de elementos subjetivos\, como las preferencias y gustos de cada analista\, pero de mi parte prefiero valorar la intención de los desarrolladores y el resultado final que está a la vista.

ButThere is a lot one could say about the God of War series. From the prior games\, it is easy to say that the driving force behind the series has been the engaging and unique story. In games 1-3 (+acension) it is generally similar fighting styles with a hack and slash type feeling with some fun combos and quite obviously the boss fights that make the player feel like a god slaying badass. But what makes this game so special is the fact that they took all the good parts of the game and made those better whilst at the same time completely revamping everything else in the process. The combat feels much more meaningful. Each enemy poses their own unique threat and they don't feel like cannon fodder into the super god slaying Beyblade that was Kratos in the previous titles. You aren't going to run into one hit enemies. You are going to need to use everything at your disposal in a majority of your battles. There is an engaging environment and it really does a good job of showing what the ps4 is capable of as well as how much the reworked engine has improved the game in general (HOLY CRAP THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL). The boss fights in the game are just as fun as the ones in previous titles if not more. No spoilers but some bosses will make you want to kill them in real life as much as you do in the game. I could go on and on but at the end of the day you need to try it yourself. I have always been an xbox player. But lately ps4 exclusives have been stealing the show and the release of this game was the selling point for me. I have now switched to a ps4 pro and have been playing many of the ps4 exclusives and atleast in this console generation. Ps4 takes the cake especially when it comes to story driven single player games that make you immersed. Very rarely do I want to replay a single player game after I beat it. I usually rent solo games from Redbox as I don't see the replay value. However\, 15 minutes into the game after I rented it I bought the thing back and I bought it for full price. Because the environment alone had me sold. Character development\, combat\, environment\, graphics\, all other aspects of the game are all just top notch. This game is worth it to anyone even if you haven't played the previous games. Just watch a 20 minutes story catch up video on youtube and you'll get the jist. This game is beyond worth the money and I am now playing through the game again on God of War difficulty in pursuit of a 100% completion. The best thing about it. Doesn't feel like a grind in the slightest. I am loving every second of this jaw-dropping title.… Expand"

In a time where echoes of 'SP is dead' (insert eyeroll here) ripple through the gameosphere\, God of War shows that single player games can be immersive\, interesting\, beautiful\, thought provoking\, and FUN. The fluid combat had me itching to find more things to unleash my Leviathan axe upon\, the mechanics had me clapping my lil hands like a baby seal\, and the puzzles had me squealing with joy everytime I came upon another rune chest to open. The story is fantastic\, and though you'll find no spoilers here\, I will say by the end of it\, my mind was blown and I am itching to play the next one. The beauty of the world around Kratos and Atreus is utterly captivating. i want to tell you my favorite places\, but I won't because I enjoyed not knowing which areas I got to explore and which I didn't. It is this beauty that makes me quite happy to trundle along on my merry way back through a route I've already taken\, which\, I must point out for those of you who aren't too keen on back and forth-ing\, happens often\, but always with good cause and sometimes with a few more enemies along the way. The puzzles are not difficult to work out\, and once you've found the core way of getting thngs done (or solved) you'll find this pretty easy. One thing to note is that you set the pace yourself in the game. If you want to stick to the core story\, you can do that and streamline your way through to the end. If you're more of a puzzle seeker\, wants-to-collect everything kind of player\, God of War caters to you too. There are some challenges you'll need to work toward by making sure your strength\, defense\, armor\, weapons etc are all up to par for the task at hand\, but for me\, this added to the beauty of the game. The way the story and the game are integrated is exceptional - there are no cut scenes with long sprawling dialogue. All in all\, this game is a masterpiece and if you're even considering trying it\, go forth and do so because it is by far the best game I have ever played. I do have one complaint\, and it's picky at best\, but now that I've completed the game\, the long stretches of silence make me a bit sad as Mimir seems to have said all he had in his arsenal.… Expand"

If you are ever looking for games that can show what the PS4 is really capable of than this is a must buy. One scene that shows the true colors and vibrance of the game is when you meet The Witch after you have shot her animal. After she tells you to carry the bore to her home you are slowly walking up this trail and you can see all these trees and plants. The variety of the colors and the different animals roaming around her home is just a beautiful sight to look at. Gameplay is on a whole other level when it comes to fighting enemies and how you take them out. If you are skeptical on buying this game because you might think you'll be running around doing useless boring side-quest. Look no further than your first boss fight with The Stranger. This fight right here is one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen in a video game. It is also how it will be for the rest of the game. There is no dull moment where I feel like i'm doing stuff that has no affect on the story and that brings me to the story of the game.  For the first time we get to see Kratos act like a father figure and actually stay calm when something does not go his way. We see growth between both main characters from Atreus learning all the things he possesses and Kratos learning not to rip other peoples heads off because they don't agree with him and not wanting his son to do the same mistakes he did. The only complaint I have with the game but is something you just get used to is the camera. I always finding myself getting hit from behind because it doesn't allow you to look in the back of you quick enough. Yes\, you can do the quick turn but then I can't see the other enemy I was focusing on.

It is no longer the raw\, blood-thirsty hack 'n slash that I fell in love with years ago. This new God of war though\, I fell in love with this one all over again. Sure\, the game has it's negatives. The mobs and mini-bosses could have been more varied. The \""no camera-cuts\"" is cool but that also means that there's more backtracking. Personally I also miss the bloodiness\, gore and nakedness of the old games\, but I'm not taking that in to account in my score\, because this is a new game and should not be scored lower because of the previous God of war trilogy. The graphics\, even on the standard PS4's 1080p\, are truly amazing. The fluidity of the combat is very good\, and the axe throwing mechanic is very well done. Don't be fooled by people who claim that the game can easily be finished by hiding behind a shield and throwing your axe\, those people obviously didn't try any higher than the lowest difficulty setting. The voice acting is very on-point\, and the story is just beautiful.To round it out\, from both a technical and an artistic standpoint this game surpasses so many others. You can tell that the people at Santa Monica Studios really poured their heart and soul in to making a fantastic\, single player\, story driven experience. If you just finished reading this comment thinking this might be a game for you\, then I do strongly recommend you rent/buy this game. It's a future classic.… Expand"

The Last of Us' influcence can't be overstated here for this game. You play as Kratos who's thrown aside his old ways and has traveled to the land of the Norse gods to start anew. You then set out on a journey of discovery with his son Atreus\, who is a very well done and developed character in his own right. The story is amazing considering what Kratos used to be. His character development here is astounding and\, for the first time ever playing these games\, I really truly cared about him as the lead\, instead of just being along for the ride of the first 3 games. And the story can be VERY long if you do all the amazing side quests that come with the game\, which you definitely should. Upwards of 40-50 hours\, depending on how quickly you move through the quests. It's a very good ride from start to finish and something I can't recommend enough.The combat has been changed entirely as well. No longer a top down\, beat-em-up style arcade game\, this game has lots of depth to it. While the game's pacing at the beginning slows down everything you can eventually do\, making the first few hours fairly difficult for new players\, by the end of the game\, you'll be smashing heads with the best of them. I'd say the only issue would be that gaining XP is very simple in the game and you'll have access to most of the talents fairly early on if you do all the side quests. It's very fun once you get the hang of it and I had a very good time with it.I truly never thought I'd see the day when a God of War game would become one of my favorite games of a generation but it's here. I'd say this has cemented itself as a top 5 game for the system and it'll be very tough for anything to top it. If you've got a PS4\, go buy this game as soon as you can. I can't say enough good things about it and I really hope that the developers run with this for the eventual next part of the series.… Expand"

Set in the Norse mythology instead ofGod of War is nothing short of a masterpiece when it comes to video games. Everything in this game leaves a huge impression on me\, this includes\, game play\, writing\, graphics\, story\, character progression and everything else on the table.Kratos makes his return on the ps4 this time; we have not seen him since God of War ascension back in 2013. Set in the Norse mythology instead of Greek mythology\, with the past catching up to Kratos just as his wife has passed away and his son still at a young age. He decides it is time for his son to learn how to survive in his brutal world. Filled with monsters\, giants\, ogres and trolls\, while Kratos is stern with his son he is also sensitive to him as well almost giving him a human side to him instead of making him the one-dimensional character we have seen over the past decade. The way these two characters interact with each other is incredible the only thing I can compare it to is The Last of Us. Kratos acts like a tough father but when it comes to certain things in the story\, you can see the emotion in his eyes and hear it in his voice\, which is something we rarely see in the world of video games especially in God of War games. With Atreus\, he has the accurate traits of a child his age asking questions about the world\, questioning the love of his father and a bit of attitude when it comes to certain subjects in the story. These are the human traits\, that we want to see more often in video games.The combat does a 180-degree turn when you compare the combat systems of the older games to the new one. In the new game\, you are carrying an axe that just destroys anything its blade touches. As you progress through the game\, you will get experience points so that you can unlock new moves with the axe\, and as you level up you need to collect certain resources either in chests or off dead enemies\, to upgrade your weapon to the next level. Progressing through the game\, you run in to a blacksmith named Brok and his brother who can help you make things\, like chest & wrist armor for you and Atreus but once again\, to upgrade them you have to have certain resources and enough silver.The world in God of War is open but it is not open at the same time. I know what you are thinking how does this work? you can be in a area that is quite open and has many different paths\, but it all leads to somewhere whether it be a chest\, a mini boss fight to get an element for a piece of gear\, or upgrade it\, it all leads somewhere.Everything that happens in God of War left me wanting more of the series\, some moments left me speechless\, sad\, and angry and in some cases even happy. I have only played one game like this in my entire life\, The Last of Us and God of War is no exception of how spectacular it is. This so far is my game of the year so far.God of War 10/10 a Perfect ScoreGood job Sony Santa Monica and Playstation.Reviewed by ICE at Gamers of the Round Table.… Expand"

Atreus/Loki is useful very well. Anyway i'll give it 10/10 (11/10 if i could) Thanks for this game peace.… Expand

After a good week of playing time\, I feel like the changing of the direction was necessary in order to bring the game into the current generation.  Games in general feel more mature\, fleshed out and serious which have never been God of War's forte.  Sony have worked wonders by giving the game meaning and I presume have taken a massive gamble by trying to update the series.  The trademark gore and action remains\, but the combat has been revamped from a pure hack and slash to bring weighty mechanics behind it\, along with strategy.  It feels more like Batman Arkham asylum in fighting style terms\, with each axe swing noticeably causing damage a slight wince as you cut holes into your foes.  The graphics are absolutely astounding\, I am playing on my PS4 PRO on a 4k TV with HDR settings on and I can safely say this is easily the best looking game I own at the moment\, or probably have seen.  The 'one shot' camera feels brilliant with constant views of what's going on to the point where you don't know the cut scenes have started in some places!

The Nordic lore and setting really fits in well after Kratos has destroyed all the spartan gods from 1-3.  I really enjoy the relationship between Kratos and his son Atreus.

In everything from the combat mechanics to the story writing to the random inter-character dialogues\, everything was incredibly well put together.The combat mechanics (the ax throws\, the ax swings) are flawless. The weight feels right. The parry timing is on point. The variety of attacks is just right. Using Atreus\, the main character's son\, as a secondary fighter was very smoothly done. The way he grows and is able to fight on his own\, but still respond to your command\, is just right.Similarly\, the way Atreus is used to solve puzzles is well done. He acquires a unique range of skills to unlock areas and solve puzzles to progress the story\, and it never felt forced or out of context with the story/setting.That said\, the entire interaction between Kratos (main character) and Atreus is one of the most unique interactions I've ever seen in a video game. At first it's hard not to think of The Last of Us and the interaction between those characters\, but there is so much more ethos and pathos in the relationship between Kratos and Atreus. Their father/son bond is tenuous\, at best\, and how they both grow as characters\, feeding off of each other and learning from their mistakes\, is near-perfectly written.Nothing felt out of place. Atreus is masterfully used by the developers to \""teach\"" Kratos about lore and other things in the world that are really meant to be taught to the player. Similarly\, Kratos teaches Atreus about combat and about nagivation. This dynamic is completely natural and such a unique way to fill the player in on aspects of the game. Other NPCs eventually add to this role\, as well\, all the while maintaining a completely natural addition to the story.The no-cut camera\, while hard to get used to the shakiness at first\, was very impressive by the end. Not a single loading screen\, as all load times were well-disguised by in-game mechanics such as lifting a log or climbing up a mountain wall.The voice acting and animation were also stunning.

The \""semi-open\"" world of GoW 4 really gives a bunch of opportunities for collection\, quest progression\, and other things that could be possible in such game style.Not to mention the great soundtrack and Kratos' character development are very well done and give us a sense of the old games and mix them with a new feeling. Same applies to gameplay. Some complain some moves might be useless and meaningless\, but you can find a way to make them useful if you test out combinations and other moves with them than just spamming buttons repeatedly like we were used to in the original GoWs. Great combat system overall and in general. a legendary experience to not be forgotten.… Expand"

83416,GOW2018,2018-05-20,10,"God of War is a welcome addition to the franchise and shows the progression and change of this fabled warrior/god to father/teacher and protector. The adventure itself was a nice change of pace from the previous games where the sole purpose was to kill gods rather than this game where you are trying to honor the memory of what it seems to be one of the most important characters in the game.ProsThe world of Norse mythology they created is beautiful\, it was like putting places to stories I have known most of my life. The graphics are wonderful and the resolution and contrast between the characters/enemies and environment was done really well. Cause unlike other games you don't really know\, outside the obvious big open rooms that scream its time to fight\, when enemies are going to pop up out the ground to come try and kill you.The main side characters are well thought out and put a good spin and comedic relief on a game that without them could seem like a tedious dungeon crawler. The humor provided by the dwarfs and your little buddy hanging on your belt really take away from long boat rides or dungeon clearing. Granted not sure why one of them has a germ phobia but hey who am I to judge\, I preferred the blue one anyway.The story is one of my favorite aspects of this game. They give you just enough that you are begging for the next title because all they do is talk about some aspects/figures of Norse mythology without including them in the game and around every corner and when certain points of the game are taking place you are just waiting for someone to pop out and try to kick your ass. Now I am sure they left things up in the air and some characters out of the game due to the sheer size of this game and I can't blame them Hell I already want a sequel to this game. And the story deserves one considering all the plot twists and story points that were left open by time the credits were rolling.Finally\, I enjoyed the combat of this game. It was way less button mashing and facerolling of enemies and more of strategic thought process and what skills to have and use\, enemies to kill first\, how best to use your protégé\, and mechanics. Some of the boss fights left something to be desired and was more story driven then combat oriented but most were just difficult enough that you had to really pay attention to what abilities needed to be evaded.Cons:The loot system was a welcome change from the previous games but sadly needs some work. The ability to change how your characters look with different equipment was nice compared to just how the weapons changed slightly when upgrading them. Just wish they would have worked on the stat system and \""level up\"" system a bit more. Cause to a be honest I had a piece of loot pretty much the entire game and due to one small aspect I never got rid of it.The ending left something to be desired\, the plot points were surprising but didn't expect it to end when it did or the way it did considering how long it took to get there.Finally\, I wanted to see more realms\, and they kept the best ones locked tight\, for the sequel im guessing. Not to mention they didn't put much thought into two of the realms. Don't get me wrong I loved the change of pace and basically skill and gear check of these two realms\, but they consisted of combat trials and a dungeon. I feel like they could have done so much more.The game was amazing with a few let downs but nothing to deter people from buying or at least renting this amazing title. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has never even heard God of War. Can not wait for the sequel. They have definitely stepped in the right direction to open up a new world for the Greek Badass and his Son.… Expand"

This is a large focal point of the narrative behind the newest entry in the God of War series\, which works as a sequel and a reboot in equal parts as the title takes place a number of years after the events of God of War III\, with an aged\, tired Kratos living the quiet life in the land of the Norse gods. Not only are we treated to new mythology\, which ties in with the past games\, the overall style has changed\, featuring an open world ripe for exploration\, with a one-shot camera and combat that is akin to an accessible Dark Souls clone.The story picks up a short time after Kratos' wife passes\, with our hero and his son Atreus setting off on a journey to spread her ashes at the top of a mountain peak\, per her wishes. Before they can set off on their mission\, a stranger arrives that sets the stage for most of the conflicts throughout the rest of the game. After a close\, extremely cinematic battle\, they are on their way. While the previous games in the series followed Kratos on his quest for revenge against the gods\, this story is a much smaller\, personal story that focuses on Kratos’ past\, his relationship with his son and the secrets he's kept from him\, with the Norse gods peppered in occasionally and setting the stage for what I am assuming will be a number of sequels. The story is solid and conveys the uneasy relationship our duo has in a meaningful way. It's a welcome change and worthy of much of the praise it has received\, but it's far from perfect. I spent my 20+ hours with the main story expecting Thor or Odin to show up to throw down with our hero\, which never truly comes to pass and leaves the finale feeling a bit anticlimactic.As I stated earlier\, the number of gods you encounter is on a much smaller scale than previous games\, with most of the boss battles being larger creatures\, which were nothing short of cannon fodder in past games. While these are still thrilling\, a number of the encounters go on much longer than they rightfully should and can become stale. You can only deplete a characters life bar so many times with it refilling before wanting to throw something other than the Leviathan Axe\, which is Kratos' new tool of destruction; opposed to previous entries\, this is the only weapon you'll use for about half of the game. Don't get me wrong\, the new combat is fun and refreshing (calling back the Axe similar to Thor's hammer never gets old) once you get the hang of the new control scheme\, but the variety the past games offered in terms of weapons was on a much grander scale. This iteration only has a total of two true weapons that can be customized and upgraded like in the past\, which can make the combat a bit less thrilling. The violence has also been toned down quite a bit; while there is still a lot of blood and gore\, you won't see our protagonist strangling anyone with their own innards on this outing.Exploration will be a big part of the game\, as the title has a fully-fledged open world that can be explored as you see fit\, with Metroidvania inspired mechanics in place to keep you revisiting past areas looking for stray chests\, upgrades\, or side quests after the proper equipment is acquired. All of this can be done post-game for those of you who prefer to stay focused on the main objective; however\, there is no option for a New Game Plus\, which hopefully will be added in an update. There are plenty of side missions and post-game content to keep you revisiting the title\, as well as the additional difficulties\, so there are replay options in place.  For those of you worrying about Atreus being a lackluster companion that you must babysit\, rest assured he is a more than capable companion who often helps in combat and uses his bow to access areas that are blocked off early in the game. While he can be a bit of a jerk at times\, I haven't cared this much about an AI companion since Ellie in The Last of Us.I remember getting God of War III at launch and being in awe of the visuals\, which look extremely tame in comparison to the newest release. This is hands down one of the best looking games I've ever seen. The visuals pack an impressive amount of details and are relatively bug free\, with only a few minor glitches being present\, one being one of Kratos' eyes rolling around while the other was static\, as if he was possessed by a demonic force. While we are on the subject of eyes\, they were one of my favorite aspects of the visuals\, with the pain and toll of being a god present in Kratos' eyes.If you own a PS4\, you should buy this.… Expand"

After 6 full play throughs and 1 platinum trophy later I’m still not tired of this game. I can’t wait for a sequel.Reasons why I gave this game a 10....(This doesn’t mean it’s perfect. No game is!)1) Combat is exciting. There are plenty of combos and runic attacks to keep things interesting. It doesn’t get that difficult unless you choose the “Give Me God of War” setting. However\, enemy variety is probably the weakest part of the entire game. This is most likely because they are saving a lot for future titles.2) Graphics are stellar. There is no real argument to the contrary.3) Exploration is extensive. This is a big game and there is so much to see.  It isn’t hard to find large new areas. If you put in a moderate amount of effort you won’t miss much.4) Leveling is straight forward.  There are minimal weapon stats to increase so the majority of your level is armor depended.5) Story is captivating.  There are multiple character arches you will experience.  I found myself sympathetic at some parts and annoyed at others but that is what excellent writing does.  It makes you feel something.  I’ll also include lore here and say I learned so much about God of War’s take on Norse mythology. The only thing is that it left little to the imagination by stating it in a direct way.6) Pacing is fairly well done during the main campaign. Even during times when all you’re doing is traveling from one place to the other the devs added clever ways to keep your attention.7) Most of all\, after I had finished everything there was to do in the entire game I wanted to see and experience more and more and more.Do yourself a favor and get this game.

This Norse God of War game breathes new life into the franchise\, taking not only an entire mythological history and swapping it for another but also switching up the gameplay\, style\, aesthetic\, and changing the very nature of the old hack-and-slash platformers that these games are known for. Of course\,Absolute perfection\, and an immense improvement on the previous games in the series. This Norse God of War game breathes new life into the franchise\, taking not only an entire mythological history and swapping it for another but also switching up the gameplay\, style\, aesthetic\, and changing the very nature of the old hack-and-slash platformers that these games are known for. Of course\, pieces of the game are still reminiscent of the old style but for all intents and purposes\, this is a new type of GoW game altogether... and it’s beautiful. My biggest gripes with the other games are now not in the series at all anymore: the helpful health\, magic\, and rage chests alternating between what they offer: gone. The tedious button-mashing to defeat bosses\, open doors\, and any other interactable objects: gone. In exchange\, God of War IV dilutes those elements or raplaces them completely. Sure\, there are small stones that may change color depending on what they offer but by no means are they the only source of that object and really\, are almost entirely missable. Button-mashing is only in the game less than a dozen times and it's also mostly avoidable\, or completely necessary to put you in Kratos' shoes (as far as effort goes).While not open world\, the map is large and explorable\, spanning out from the center like a spider's web. In this way\, it would be most accurate to draw comparisons to Rise of the Tomb Raider or Bioshock where they're are not \""levels\"" to progress through story\, but chapters that take place in different areas that can be accessed at any time. In aesthetic\, though\, comparisons between this game and Skyrim\, Middle-Earth\, The Witcher or Dragon Age as they revolve around a slightly more mideival-fantasy genre. Really\, calling this game Rise of the Tomb Raider meets Skyrim would be a great way to look at this game as a whole. The other GoW games took you from point A to B to C\, and so on. This game\, on the other hand\, lays out A-Z all at the same time and you get to decide which letter you approach first. From there\, A2\, A3\, A4\, and other sections of each letter can be unlocked\, if that analogy makes sense. It's not quite a \""play your way\"" sort of story but the kind of variations and customizations that are offered astounded me\, and I still can't stop playing.The map is very large but I do have a few problems with it. For one\, some sections of it are quite maze-like. Since it's a spider-web shape\, you have to follow trails to get between certain sections which means if you want to travel to a different area\, you'd have to trek through the trails and are unable to find shortcuts. For example\, I wanted to beat the Valkyrie in The Mountains but the Yggdrasil door closest to it took me to a spot 1400m away: above where I wanted to be. The map has no apparent depth when looking at it from above and not being able to rotate it or change perspective became troublesome at times. That is probably the biggest thing I would change as it slowed down my gameplay quite a bit.That being said\, my problems with the map stop after Midgard and since there are 5 other realms to explore (all smaller) the problems are mostly limited to that realm. Niflheim\, Muspeilheim\, Helheim\, and Alfheim are all explorable and each offer their own unique perks\, challenges\, and areas to devote your time to. The best part: you could play the game without even venturing once into two of those places which end up serving as a complete bonus for players who wanted to experience more of the worlds Santa Monica built for us.Speaking of the developers: this game has\, by far\, the best story of any game I've played in a very long time. The action and emotion are both astronomically impacting and both aspects make the experience as a whole entirely unmatched. The voice acting as well has been vastly improved; Kratos is no longer a sort of eye-rolling dialoguist but now is a rusted poet full of heart and buried emotion. It truly was a heartbreaking\, heartwarming\, and mesmerizing experience following Kratos and Atreus on this journey.I could go on for hours but I think I've sold this game enough and just hope that just one single person out there who hasn't played this game is reading this review is now convinced to give it a try\, I've succeeded. Borrow it from a friend\, rent it\, buy it\, however you can. Scrape pennies out of the couch and call in your favors: God of War IV is the must-play game of the year.… Expand"

And the memorable and carefully grafted characters. It is enjoyable to accompany an older more mature Kratos\, who has grown somewhat tired of all the fighting and blood shed... All in all this GOW is the complete package\, a superior game to all the ones that game before it. If I could recommend only one PS4 game\, this would be it (haven’t played Tsushima yet). It seems there isn’t much room for criticism when faced with greatness\, but the only thing that bugged me at times was that Kratos and Atreus reminded me of Joel and Ellie.

This game did the impossible and brought what I thought was somewhat stale Hack and slash  franchise that I thought was dead or atleast very outdated and revamped it into a masterpiece The graphics look gorgeous and the combat is satisfying and has a real sense of impact that I think the last games were lacking.Which is probably due too the camera being above Kratoses shoulder which brings you closer too the action. But the main thing that impressed me is how they revamped our beloved kratos and made him into a character that has more emotion than before\, I’m not saying that he didn’t have any emotion or depth in the previous games but it’s more maturely done in this game. The story is good and well written. But the one thing I wish they had was more enemy diversity\, because often enemies you fight are just the exact same thing or atleast a variation or sub-class of a previous enemy. You often find yourself fighting the same enemy types.

Let’s talk about it\, but first of all\, I want to say something about my experience.I finished the game a long time ago and my memory isn’t fresh. Anyway\, I have something to say. It was one of the first PlayStation 4 games I’ve played andGod of war. It’s a great game with a massive protagonist; a big Sony's exclusive; so much money spent on advertising and a lot of disappointed fans. Let’s talk about it\, but first of all\, I want to say something about my experience.I finished the game a long time ago and my memory isn’t fresh. Anyway\, I have something to say. It was one of the first PlayStation 4 games I’ve played and I’d played some older part of the franchise. If my memory serves\, I’d been playing God of War 2 on PS2 and without a doubt it was gorgeous. That is why I’m somewhat a fan of this franchise.Let’s go into the specifics of this game.Well\, detailed graphics is one of the pros of the new game. Everything in the game’s vast and advanced world\, including the buildings\, the tools\, the ground\, the sky\, even the characters’ skin is highly detailed. Admittedly\, it’s not an open world\, and I think it’s for the better because the developers were able to show an interesting mythical Nordic place without an open world. However\, you could travel through that any time\, so the action is not limited to closed spaces.The new axe mechanics are impressive. They provided us with new ways of killing enemies in combat - you can throw an axe and destroy anyone from a distance\, or smash skulls of the enemies at hand with one hit. The Leviathan Axe\, furthermore\, helps to open new places\, solve puzzles\, etc. I realize that the developers worked hard to create them. There is a tree of new skills for your axe\, shield and other gear. So\, you gain experience and spend it on improving the power of Kratos and his son. Afterwards\, you have a mighty team to kill anybody in a brutal nice-looking way with your axe\, shield and bow.The game’s beautiful music helps tough Kratos to look more brutal. The Music and the sound design in the game create a deep and atmospheric. They submerge you into the Scandinavian entertainment.In addition to skills\, Kratos and his son Atreus have various equipment that you can enhance. Also\, you can find some new armour\, spend coins on new gear and improve the one you already have.But it doesn’t help that much. The armour and equipment at the beginning of the game and the end are the same\, except for the enhanced parameters\, and they’re useless against simple enemies and even the bosses. It’s not like in the third Witcher where you get the best armour or a sword that makes the character a mighty machine. There you understand that you didn’t waste your time to gain the coins to improve your rags. But in the God of War\, the equipment is simply stylistic.The similar situation with the enemies. Neither do they look different during the game. They just change the colour and aura. They even look similar in different worlds. I agree that there are a few different worlds where you travel through portals. The environment there doesn’t look similar\, except for the rival creatures and bosses.Oh yeah\, the bosses. I think the bosses are one of the biggest cons of the game. In previous games of this franchise\, Kratos cut off the heads of the Olympic Gods. Every level ended with a fight with a new boss. It doesn’t matter who it was. It looked exciting and brutal\, what you can’t say about the bosses of the new game. There is only one god whom you can’t kill during the game\, who you fight against two or three times. Also\, one kind of bosses is trolls; and they are everywhere\, just coloured differently and that’s all. It’s a pity that you can’t see a variety of enemies in this big Sony’s exclusive and in the sequel of such a famous game.A similar creature is not the only sin of this game. The plot is based on travelling. Similar\, concepts you could see in The Last of Us\, where Ellie and Joel have a trip with some goal. And Kratos with his son has to travel for a reason. Don’t you see the similarity? Yes\, in my opinion\, the authors copied the basics of the game and didn’t cover their tracks. With sadness\, I admit that the copy is worse than the original. Because even formation of the relationship between the father and the son is insincere\, unrealistic. You can’t believe in the play of the boy. But don’t focus on it; it’s not the best plot and not the best game in the world. However\, you will remember the brilliant phrase: «Feed us\, Boy! » for a long time. When you begin playing the game\, you will understand why I mentioned it.Eventually\, the Santa Monica Studio made a great work\, but I know they can do better. I hope they’ll make a better sequel with more variety of enemies\, and the plot won’t be boring  I give 8 points to the game. And I wish Sony didn’t spend so much money on advertising. It would better if they used it to increase the quality of their games.… Expand"

The combat system itself is excellent and vastly improved but it does get old after awhile to see the same head stomp animation over and over.Santa Monica Studio deserves high praise for reinventing the old jaded GoW formula.

I'll just rate some different categories from 1 to 10 below\, what I like and don't like about this game.Graphics 10/10\n\nAs expected of Sony and Santa Monica\, the reboot of God of War has fantastic graphics.

I'll just rate some different categories from 1 to 10 below\, what I like and don't like about this game.Graphics 10/10As expected of Sony and Santa Monica\, the reboot of God of War has fantastic graphics. The landscapes\, mobs and creatures\, as well as the protagonists are designed on a very high level and makes them look more believable. Although I must say that I really miss the godlike\, flawless Kratos jawline :D.Story 10/10I think I'm like halfway-through now\, and the main plot to this point has got me pretty hard. I like how the main focus is the education of Atreus by Kratos\, and not just slaughtering all gods that come across you. The dwarven quests and treasure maps are also pretty cool and add a little bit more deepness into the open-world adventure.Characters 10/10I'm focusing mainly on the protagonists here. Kratos and Atreus are very well-written characters in God of War. Finally we get a more deeper look into Kratos' personality\, who before was just an angry\, vicious and screaming fella\, and now is a caring father\, who would give his life for the sake of his son. Kratos is still grumpy\, but at least we can relate to him a little better\, when he shows his human sides. Atreus feels generic from the first time we see him ingame. Like a son\, who really wants to show his father\, that he can stand for himself\, fight and handle things alone without Kratos. Later on (spoiler alert!!!)\, when Kratos tells him that he's a god\, we can feel his shift in personality\, that he thinks he is invulnerable and unstoppable\, as he begins to rebel against Kratos. This adds more tension and makes their relation even more interesting. But play the game yourself and you will know :).Music 9/10Epic\, generic and sometimes ambient\, the God of War soundtrack makes you feel the nordic atmosphere. From freezing landscapes to boss fights\, the soundtrack doesn't fail to support the feeling of the game. Only thing I missed (to this point) is the original Kratos Soundtrack\, that was playing in all games before. Gave me real chills and goosebumps whenever I heard it.Gameplay 10/10Compared to the old GOW games\, the fighting system relies on more controlled actions\, rather than fast combos like square\,square\,triangle with the Blades of Chaos. Kratos' Axe is his new main weapon and gives you the possibility to throw it to freeze enemies or proceed in the typical GOW riddles. The animations are smooth\, haven't had any problems or bugs to date. And as announced\, there are no eternal loading screens\, that keep appearing whenever you enter a new area. This makes the game more fluid and smoother.Enemies\, Bosses etc. 8/10Maybe I'll get some hate for this one\, but after beating 10 golems and trolls in this game\, seeing them over and over again feels kind of boring to me. Don't get me wrong\, the fights can still be challenging\, regarding the fact that they always get more HP and damage\, but as far as I noticed they don't get any new moves and attacks that make them even more challenging than the ones before them. But nothing feels more epic\, than beating a boss in GOW. I enjoyed every inch of the dragon boss battle\, maybe it wasn't that challenging\, but hell do they give you that f***ing nostalgia. So far this was my only critique point in this game.Conclusion 10/10For a hack&slay game\, GOW offers to you more than you can imagine in this genre. Open world feeling\, a challenging fighting system\, interesting side quests\, well rounded main story\, an epic soundtrack and gorgeous graphics and animations. If this game doesn't get the Game of the Year Award\, I don't know what will.Thanks for reading\, and I hope my english wasn't all that bad. :D… Expand"

Story is... lacking time to time and st other has that gow over the top lines. But in all the story is better than most other game cough cough destiny.... rpg elements are simple if you want but can also be deep if you take the time to understand and strategize around abilities. Some people won't like over the shoulder view but it is what it is it does give a slight immersive  feeling although at times kratos body does cover a bit of your field of view.It's a fresh start on a series that was getting tiring of doing same thing over and over. This truly is one of the best reboots to a series and I guess technically at the same time is not a reboot at all... this is a god of war 4. Kratos has changed. The time period changed and gameplay changed. Hands down besides minor gripes because no one is perfect and nothing is perfect. No zelda games perfect\, the last of us isn't perfect\, halo multiplayer isnt perfect but the hold there spot respectfully in game history god of war ps4 will hold a place in game history and for that 10 is my score absolute love this game.o guess ma y if you just make a point to chase credits its shorter than 20 hrs but if you complain about how you tried your best to speed in the game you robbed your self of an amazing experience.

83601,GOW2018,2019-02-14,5,"I just finished the game. I really wanted to like this game\, but in the end I'm scoring this at 5/10.To all the people who think this is 10/10 or 9/10\, good for you. We all have different tastes\, and the beauty of internet reviews is it aggregates all our impressions toward a game into a score.On a positive note\, the game is beautiful to look at. I also enjoyed a few moments during the ending that I will not spoil here.Here are the downsides for me:I am really annoyed at all the puzzles. I usually like puzzles in an RPG\, but I doubt anyone enjoyed the different types of doors that are unlocked by magic chisel\, winds of hel\, and whatnot. I also don't appreciate the many flavors of \""throw your weapon at this thing\"" puzzles. I also am generally not a fan of spiky ceilings and rotating blades in games. Puzzles should be used as a nice break to action\, but it got too distracting.I am not a fan of pacing\, especially all the \""your princess is at another castle\"" moments. It feels like trying to cook a meal\, but you keep forgetting an ingredient so you end up making 5 other grocery runs. A short and sweet main story could have been better for the pacing. This also ruined the boat rides for me. I like conversations while walking around (like in The Last of Us)\, but because of the pacing I felt frustrated with the boat rides towards the middle half of the game. I kept waiting for the game to pick up the pace\, but that never came.Combat is decent\, nothing special here. A lot of people like the slow\, brutal nature of it. I think it's ok\, but Bloodborne may have made me set the bar very high on combat now. What I think is missing here is the incentive to use different attacks. I like it when a game rewards you for playing a certain way - those little twists that differentiate games from being gameplay clones of each other. In some old WWE games (haven't played one in years)\, the crowd turns on you if you spam a move. In Devil May Cry games you get a better score and more orbs for mixing up moves and taunting. In Bloodborne you are encouraged to go offensive with the regain system and to learn parrying. Witcher 3 encourages you to plan ahead and brew potions and bombs before a big monster fight. In GOW I didn't feel like there was a need for me to learn all the moves - I just needed the basic R1 combo\, arrow spam\, runic attacks\, and the parry.On a side note\, I think the decision to go with just that one long camera shot is interesting. The downside to that is it really killed the pacing\, because things that are usually a quick cut to a new location end up being a 60 second boat ride or jog in the portal thingy. I feel like it could be better used in a shorter game\, one with quicker pacing to really make you feel you are in that story.10/10 and 9/10 mean different things for different people. To me\, I reserve those scores for those games that keep me hooked\, the ones where you think about them while you're not playing them. As much as I want to like it\, my gripes made my playthrough more frustrating than fun.… Expand"

I'd say the main thing is that I just didn't feel that invested in the story or the characters.

That's not to say that God of War doesn't have a good story\, good characters\, or an interesting world. Actually\, it is very competent in all three categories. I just didn't feel that connection with the characters or become as engrossed in the story as I did in\, say\, the Last of Us; and I didn't feel as compelled to explore the entire world as I did in Breath of the Wild\, for example.Now\, I understand those are high bars to reach\, but those are the bars that have been set. I should note that I've never played another God of War\, so I have no prior emotional connection to any of the characters.

When this game first debuted at E3 I thought I was in for a game of the generation and bought it after the rapturous reviews confirmed what I had been feeling since its debut\, that this was a game that combined mature storytelling with excellent gameplay. I enjoyed my first playthrough fine enough & platinumed the game but when I got to the end of the rainbow I felt empty & couldn't quite understand why. After some thought I realized that the reason why I didn't care for God Of War (2018) was that it had next to nothing memorable about it as a result of liberally stealing from superior titles to the point that it had no identity. When I play other games there is always a moment when everything clicks into place: In Bloodborne it was when I defeated Father Gascoigne on my first try in 2019 after he punted me in 2016. In Sekiro it was when I had a epic clash with Genichiro atop Ashina castle and defeated him on my last sliver of health. In Persona 5 it was when I reached the climax of the second palace and the gameplay\, artistic style\, and music came together in perfect symphony. And in the Witcher 3 it was when I failed a quest line by falling for a ghosts sob story. These moments crystallized why these games were great in my mind and God Of War only had a single moment that came close which is the ludicrously entertaining battle against the Stranger which occurs in the first two hours in a 40 hour game with unfortunately the rest of it being a rote predictable example of an industry that is at its worst when it acts desperate and in need of validation from the worlds of literature & movies.  The story of this game is a barebones rip off of The Last Of Us copying many similar beats while failing to understand what made that game soar which was it's moral & emotional complexity that allowed characters to simultaneously be likeable & flawed. GOW gets close at times but fumbles at every opportunity because it won't allow Kratos to truly be flawed when Mimir can just handwave away his issues and the villains are barely above the likes of Micah Bell so the be better spiel comes across hollow because Kratos is always in the right.  The basic writing of the game was too weak with  the plot structure & pacing being atrocious with so many macguffins to collect & obstacles to overcome making the game wear out its welcome fast. The combat was initially the saving grace of the game but after playing Sekiro & Bloodborne it just feels like a pale imitation of a superior studio as the camerawork is obnoxious making enemies hard to keep track of (the camera work is also a clear rip off of Metroid Prime which forced a perspective change to change the feeling of the game & make you feel like Samus)\, the healing system stinks (a canned animation nice)\, and the combat devolves into Atreus spamming arrows & Kratos spamming special attacks over the better balance seen in FromSoft games. Finally why are the RPG elements here? it adds nothing to the game & feels just as cheap & tacky as it did in a game like Destiny.Overall God Of War (2018) is a disappointment through & through\, a game so desperate for praise & sales that it sold out every piece of unique identity it had in favour of being the most bland Triple A game ever assembled (sans multiplayer & micro transactions). Ultimately failing to improve on the games it ripped off (Metroid\, Souls\, Tomb Raider\, and The Last Of Us) or provide much of a reason for its own existence. This game would score a 5/10 and while that might be harsh to some I have so rarely wanted to trade in a game as much as I wanted to with this one.… Expand"

Since I've only played the very first game and didn't like it that much\, I had hopes for this one.Unfortunately now\, after spending a few hours playing GoW\, I must say that I'm very disappointed and I have a hard time seeing where these scores are coming from.From the get-go\, movement and combat felt slow and clunky\, as if it was trying to mimic \""Souls\"" games... and failing at it. It lacks the weight and depth that \""Souls\"" games have: Most encounters just play out the same\, you slash\, slash\, slash away without thinking much about it - until the game suddenly hits you in the face with a frustratingly difficult encounter every now and then. After that\, it's more mindless slashing.It's neither enjoyable nor interesting.Even the puzzles aren't much of a highlight. They usually seem to consist of \""throw axe at switch\, move somewhere\, recall axe\, repeat\"". And that's apparently it\, at least in the first few hours.Also\, while playing\, a few questions popped into my head many times:- Why is this game open-world? The world doesn't seem to be designed to be explored and properly utilized.- Why does this game have an equipment crafting system? Wasn't Kratos supposed to be a pretty powerful god? Why does he need to improve his equipment\, including his armor\, of all things??- Why does this game have side-quests (favors) and why do they only seem to be there in order to give you more materials (see crafting system)?The story has the potential to be the redeeming quality of this game\, but it's all dragged down by the frustratingly-samey combat and forgettable puzzles. The boredom that sets in between the story bits ruins the experience for me. I can not justify playing this game for anywhere between 20 and 30 hours (according to HowLongToBeat).Now\, it's not all bad. I want to mention that the artists working on this game did a phenomenal job. The game looks and sounds amazing and the (voice) actors delivered fantastic work. Even the tech is impressive. In many sections it runs at a relatively stable 60 FPS on PS4 Pro\, which I am very happy with.This means\, however\, that this game is \""all flash and no substance\""\, so to speak.

In previous games I was so much more concerned with hitting the right button I would miss out on some gorey goodness. That being said the game is significantly less gore filled than any of the other games. Which is bad and good at the same time. It removes the less campy feel of the series to bring a more serious tone to it. The scale of enemies however is vastly greater in the installment. I think it is because the camera is directly behind the character instead of a more isometric camera angle. So when you face a large enemy you will immediately notice the scale of them. The story is without a doubt the best the series has ever been. The story focuses on Kratos and his son Atreus going to the tallest mountain to release his wife's ashes. A simple quest turns into a daring one because they are being hunted by the Norse Gods themselves for reasons that are unknown to Kratos. This story is fantastic because it humanizes Kratos like we have never seen. Unlike the murder crazed loon we are used to Kratos is a stoic man who is only trying to teach his son how to survive and to avoid the mistakes that Kratos himself has made in the past. Now the most controversial character is Atreus because he is a child he will get on peoples nerves which is entirely understandable. He is has a point in the story the kid is unbearable\, but that is apart of the story and there is a reason why. The game has a vast variety of likeable and deep characters you never expect to see in a God of War game.Overall I loved this game more than any other in the God of War series. (Which is saying a lot being I am a huge fan) The gameplay is revamped in the best way possible. The story is deep and engaging\, and of course the game is beautiful to look at. I can't get enough of this game I want to forget about it so I can replay it again. Very few games are perfect\, but God of War is one of these masterpieces that should not be missed. I of course give it a 10/10.… Expand"

The development menu is sophisticated\, but it is understood over time. The jump was also changed.

In the plot\, Kratos is a forty-year-old who\, as a veteran of a war\, carries his pain and has to take care of his son. In the end\, it is no longer just pressing buttons.The combat is more updated with respect to games of the last five years\, which I think is a success. Now you can see the life bar of the enemies.

The enemies in this installment are crafted incredibly well\, making the use of mythological accounts and modern textures to create new abominations during your journey. The enemies feel smart\, refined and ghoulish enough to make the player pay attention to every little detail on their model.

The story also starts very exciting and is also very exciting throughout the game.  It's very sweet how the relationship between Kratos and his son Atreus develops over the course of the story.  Because of this great story alone I can recommend God of War to everyone (even non-God of War fans)! By the way\, I would also like to mention that the beard on Kratos looks very good!What definitely deserves a mention are the cutscenes. There has rarely been a game where the cutscenes looked so good. The cutscenes in God of War are qualitatively on a completely different level.Gameplay: The hack and slay gameplay in God of War has been implemented outstandingly well.  Dodging and attacking feels really smooth. The gameplay isn't stagnant or anything at all. With Atreus you have a little help in God of War.  Atreus can shoot different kinds of arrows\, which is especially useful in many boss battles.  Atreus was never disturbing. You can also buy new equipment for both characters (Kratos and Atreus) in God of War.  But you don't have to grind much\, because the end boss is also possible with weaker armor.  So God of War isn't just a grind\, like you know it from some role-playing games.Conclusion: I can really recommend God of War to anyone.  Anyone who owns a PS4 should have played God of War.

Si te gusta la mitología nórdica y conoces su historia\, te aseguro que disfrutarás la experiencia más que el resto\, pues te cuenta de dioses\, sus historias\, peleas familiares y traiciones y chismes divinos. En esta reseña trataré de no spoilear puntos importantes de la trama del juego\, pues es uno de sus mejores aspectos y es muy fácil arruinarla porque desde el inicio se revelan cosas que el jugador debe descubrir por sí mismo. Lo que sí diré es que el argumento está sorprendentemente bien contado y tiene momentos realmente emotivos que la convierten en una de las mejores formas de contar una historia en un videojuego\, ah y un final que nos dejará desarrollando teorías cierto tiempo.La trama no sólo se desarrolla a través de cortes cinemáticos\, sino que la relación entre Kratos y Atreus se forma durante caminatas\, peleas y viajes en bote. Es muy interesante ver la interacción entre personalidades tan dispares con diálogos tan bien escritos y actuados. Las animaciones faciales y corporales son simplemente extraordinarios y la actuación de voz (en inglés; no lo jugué en español) es impecable. La voz de Kratos (Christopher Judge) es uno de los mejores castings de voz de los últimos tiempos\, Atreus (Sunny Suljic) lo hace excelente y la interacción entre ambos es muy creíble y bien hecha.Uno de los logros más grandes de God of War es que desde el primer cuadro hasta el último\, todo se lleva a cabo en plano secuencia\, lo que significa que no hay cortes en ninguna parte\, incluyendo batallas y todos los demás aspectos de gameplay. En papel\, esto parece una simple técnica artística\, pero en la práctica hace que la experiencia sea más inmersiva y añade un sentimiento de presencia que no sólo resulta muy agradable\, sino que ayuda a establecer el ritmo del juego.Uno de los logros más grandes de God of War es que desde el primer cuadro hasta el último\, todo se lleva a cabo en plano secuencia\, lo que significa que no hay cortes en ninguna parte\, incluyendo batallas y todos los demás aspectos de gameplay. En papel\, esto parece una simple técnica artística\, pero en la práctica hace que la experiencia sea más inmersiva y añade un sentimiento de presencia que no sólo resulta muy agradable\, sino que ayuda a establecer el ritmo del juego.el combate se veía diferente respecto a las entregas anteriores. Esto es verdad sólo al principio\, porque empieza con un ritmo pausado para que elijas a cada uno de tus contrincantes y decidas en qué dirección lanzar los golpes. Conforme avanzas\, el sistema de batalla es cada vez más suelto y en un punto te darás cuenta de que estás jugando un God of War hecho y derecho\, lleno de acción visceral y de que lo único que cambió fue el posicionamiento de la cámara. Esto no significa que una vez avanzado el juego solo luches de esta manera\, sino que deberás adaptarte a cada enemigo o grupo de enemigos y\, cada vez\, tendrás que elegir si te conviene pelear de una forma más pausada o si lo conveniente es desatar el infierno por todos lados. En el combate pausado tendrás que aprender patrones de los oponentes para poder esquivarlos y atacar\, y\, aunque no llega a ser tan estratégico como un Dark Souls (lo siento\, la comparación es inevitable)\, es más suelto y “divertido”. Por su parte\, el modo de combate lleno de acción tiene la brutalidad que conoces de un God of War\, con ejecuciones sangrientas y diferentes para cada enemigo y\, aunque son geniales\, después de combatir hordas de las mismas criaturas tienden a tornarse repetitivas.Desde su anuncio fue claro que God of War sería un nuevo comienzo para la serie: el dios de la guerra dejó atrás la mitología griega (porque la exterminó) para dejarse la barba\, mudarse\, poner su casa en medio de los bosques de la mitología nórdica y empezar una familia. Todos estos cambios no significan que el juego haya olvidado su esencia\, pues a pesar de todo\, tiene lo suficiente para sentirse familiar. El combate visceral y violento\, los personajes carismáticos y un elevadísimo valor de producción están presentes y\, en algunas áreas\, mejores que nunca.En esta nueva entrega Kratos es acompañado por su hijo Atreus\, a quien deberá enseñar a sobrevivir en los 9 mundos viva… Expand"

As a long time fan of these games\, having owned the originals on the PS2\, then the HD collections on the PS3\, plus the epic GoW 3 remaster for the PS4\, I have to say that this new incarnation is somewhat disappointing.

As a long time fan of these games\, having owned the originals on the PS2\, then the HD collections on the PS3\, plus the epic GoW 3 remaster for the PS4\, I have to say that this new incarnation is somewhat disappointing. It feels like more of a Dark Souls rip-off than an actual God of War game\, with elements of Uncharted and the new Tomb Raider sprinkled on for good measure. It's not that this is the worst thing Sony could've done with this franchise\, it just feels too formulaic and borderline generic at this point. After going through Bloodborne and Nioh in the past year I had my fill of Souls-style gameplay. That entire sub-genre of hack-'n-slash games is starting to become overused and played out. This isn't the direction I wanted God of War to move in.The combat feels much slower and clunkier compared to any other GoW game. There's no stamina bar but you have a shield to parry now and every battle feels drawn out and methodical. Not necessarily a bad thing\, but it seems to have lost the sheer intensity that made the other games such classics. Another sort of odd design choice is the removal of jumping and aerial attacks\, which is something I loved about the older games. You fight every enemy on the ground now. This was kind of a letdown. The combat itself is satisfying enough but it still feels painfully similar to\, you guessed it\, Dark Souls. You use the right shoulder buttons for light & heavy attacks now ala Dark Souls. L1 blocks like usual\, but holding L2 & pressing R2 throws his axe to be implanted in an enemy or object. Pressing Triangle retrieves it. Just like Thor's hammer!!!The axe itself is an allright game mechanic but still not as memorable\, brutal and captivating as the Blades of Chaos. The Blades of Chaos are supposedly unlocked later in the game but I imagine that even this weapon has been awkwardly dumbed down to fit this new style of gameplay. At times the game feels way too easy. There were boss fights where all I had to do was throw and retrieve my axe. This is laughable compared to the difficulty of the older games.Speaking of bosses\, so far I've only seen 3 different kinds of bosses and 2 were completely recycled later in the game. This just seems like laziness from the developers\, whereas the old games would continuously present a variety of bosses to fight. Even the QTE's have been dumbed down in this game\, where you usually just mash circle instead of all the different joystick and button combinations of the old games. The blood and brutality has also been scaled back. You no longer see Kratos drenched in buckets of blood or dismembering his foes\, and most enemies simply get shattered into ashes or ice crystals. They also removed the nudity and sexual content to make the game more \""family friendly\"". The one woman you expect Kratos to hook up with is nothing but a tease. Plus there's one character who cusses like a sailor and I'm not sure if I ever heard a curse word at all in the original GoW games. Very strange.Kratos somehow has a son now\, who becomes more of an annoying sidekick than anything. He constantly shouts \""behind you!\"" even though you have a targeting reticule indicating the direction enemies are attacking from. Pressing Square will have him shoot arrows to distract your enemies so you can sneak up and strike them. A somewhat useful feature\, but I honestly feel that Atreus could've been scrapped from the game entirely.The purpose of Atreus is of course to show the father/son relationship with Kratos. Kratos now seems completely mellowed out as if he's been smoking pounds of weed ever since he fought Zeus at the end of GoW 3. I sort of miss the blind rage that fueled Kratos to brutalize his opponents\, so this change was hard for me to take.The \""open world\"" is sort of a faux open world\, where you mostly just find diverging pathways leading to chests and other collectibles. You constantly loot fallen enemies like most action RPGs\, plus there's a crafting system along with skill trees. This all just seems like too much to throw into a GoW game. The old games kept it simple: power up your weapons to get more moves. This new GoW is only making this more complicated to have a false sense of depth in the gameplay.The graphics are outstanding\, possibly some of the best I've ever seen. Sound quality and music is superb as well. Absolutely no complaints there.Overall I feel this game is good and worth playing\, but it's just not exactly what I wanted from a God of War game. They were trying way too hard to appeal to fans of the Dark Souls style games and now it feels like God of War has lost its own identity. I honestly hope they release all the classic GoW games for the PS4 because I really wanted that edge-of-your-seat\, arresting combat that made those games so great. What we got instead was yet again a rip-off of other games as these companies once again go for mass-market appeal over originality… Expand"

The leveling system is also terrible.  It's based on gear & good gear is NOT easy to come by in this game.  Progression is slow\, very slow.  Finding a new piece of gear that's actually good is a painstaking process & even then it becomes obsolete fairly quickly\, so don't bother upgrading anything.  The difficulty is also an unbalanced mess.  It's like they looked at Dark Souls & had NO IDEA WTF Dark Souls was because even when playing this game on normal it's impossible.  You better get ready to drop the difficulty down to easy cause that's the only way most people will be able to actually play this game.  And don't get me started on \""Give me a challenge\"" mode.  It's more like\, \""Please stick this sharp rusty knife up my ass then gouge out my eyes\"" mode.  Don't even bother trying the \""Give me God of War\"" mode. It's unbalanced to all hell & basically impossible.Overall\, game is a broken unbalanced mess but the story\, characters\, world & exploration is top notch & the only reason I'm giving this game a 6/10.  Everything else about this game is awful.  Progression\, combat\, leveling\, gear\, everything else just sucks.… Expand"

I am tired of modern lootbox-field and Fapple Royale trends that turned industry into stupid soulless grind-games. I'll keep supporting every single company that still stands for ART\, which is classic AAA-story based and gameplay-rich games. Thanks for not forgetting those who have a taste in games.GoW 2018 isBefore everything I wanted to say thank you to Sony and Santa Monica Studio. I am tired of modern lootbox-field and Fapple Royale trends that turned industry into stupid soulless grind-games. I'll keep supporting every single company that still stands for ART\, which is classic AAA-story based and gameplay-rich games. Thanks for not forgetting those who have a taste in games.GoW 2018 is a modern breathe of old series. Prologue took about 2 hours. I learnt about how World structure works and fought two bosses. And I want to say I really enjoyed.Gameplay:GoW have always been primarily a gameplay sort of games (for me). And as much as we all loved oldschool slashers — previous basis couldn't last long after ps2/ps3 era. Something had to be changed. Why score is 9\, not 10 — because I'm a bit tired of how 90% of combat systems are now divided on two paradigms: \""Batman Arkham press x to win style\"" and \""Souls-style\"" both of which I really hate and am tired of.However\, GoW combat system is a much deeper thing but feels like it has a Souls hit-box core but with allusion on oldschool GoW style and much more flexible. Thanks to upgrades and interesting combos it feels good\, and makes me try my best to beat even a couple of enemies. I'd recommend you to play on Hard because it makes you invent a strategy\, fight with mind and sometimes even survive actually\, to learn the behavior of different types of enemies. Hardcore fights immersed me into a role of old and tired Cratos who is still old but can beat them asses if you focus. In this part you rather survive than just slaughter in Rage everyone. While some xbox-loosers speak of \""TLoU\"" cliche — I see an evolved character with changed body and mind condition.Gameplay is perfectly integrated into cutscenes and vice versa. When I caught myself on trying to press buttons during cutscenes and doing nothing during gameplay because I thought it was a cutscene - I actually jumped off my chair and started screaming at how INSANELY GOOD the stage of the game is.Bosses is a special cherry on the pie in GoW-2018. In prologue I met only two of them yet but they both were absolutely unique\, and handmade. Everything is perfect with bosses: unique battlefields with semi-procedural destruction\, unique battle style and tactics needed to win each\, their behavior during the battle (emotions\, dialogues)\, the perfect integration of scripts that don't actually annoy you (I hate when devs are destroying gameplay by making very scripted game but GoW isn't the one of these games. It has scripts but their role and feel is absolutely different). This aspect of the game is 20 of 10.I enjoy physics in the game. There actually isn't that a lot of physics integration but that a little bit of what we have — really feels good. Moving objects\, destructive objects\, Axe's flight. It immerses\, makes everything natural + Trowing an axe is a special mini-game for me that I really love. It isn't just about enjoying animation. It's useful in combat to take a perfect moment to call back the Leviathan so it could hit as much enemies as it's possible and stun them for a second. It could actually save you some time. Especially when you play on hard and you have to count your moves and think\, meanwhile a tone of enemies coming.Open World:What else you want in single-player story-based games? This is still a linear story but with the opportunity to go and research it if you wish. Everything is optional\, noone makes you to explore it. At the same time exploring is enjoyable. It opens unique atmospheric views for you\, it has secrets\, it gives you some extra battles and then it rewards you with some loot\, gifts and silves which might help you to upgrade yourself much faster. Everything is optional. It is up to you about how to build your story and what footpaths to follow. And this is excellent and ideal for a linear single-player game.  World is linear but open and able to explore it.And yeah\, views... Views are incredible!Plot:I totally disagree with \""The Last of Us\"" cliche\, because relationships between younger and older\, or parents vs their kids — is an infinite scenario to develop and talk about in our life. Atreus is the one who opens our old character from the other angle. Cratos evolved\, too. I only completed a prologue but I see he has a rich background and even more changes are coming. Atreus is a typical maximalist kid but definitely has a charisma. I find my younger self in him. Cratos feels much better as a person. Integration of Scandinavian folklore yet seems incredible. Game has a little bit of very good humor (sometimes I don't even understand whether it was just a comedy-moment right now or just an unorthodox behavior of character which has some meaning :D ) meanwhile I can't say it come to some sort of stupid grotesque like in Marvel Movies. Not at all. Everything about stage\, dialogues and cutscenes is on a very high level.… Expand"

You mainly use one weapon\, an axe\, but it gets really really old to slash enemies with it\, throw it\, and do the same finishing moves over and over again. The boss fights aren't that great or exciting\, either. I honestly felt like the combat was like the Witcher or Dark Souls\, but more boring and repetitive\, reminding me of an early PS3 game.There are some complex puzzles\, new for a series\, that are relatively fun.I am just so disappointed by this game\, and do not understand the hype\, at all. I know people will say those who don't like it is because it isn't like the older games\, but it isn't that. I understand that combat isn't supposed to be the only focus anymore\, and the game is supposed t include more of the story and have more nuanced\, less brutal/graphic violence. But the combat isn't all that exciting\, and with a subpar story and characters\, there really isn't much here to be excited about. Other reboots or gameplay changes in series\, such as Zelda BoTW\, Tomb Raider\, and MGS 5 have been great\, so I was hopeful for this title. But instead\, the changes made here are not successful and have created a very vanilla game. I will say that this is the most overrated game on the PS4.… Expand"

However\, it has disappointingly average bosses. God of War has annoying and inconsistent enemies and enemy levels. Off-screen cheap deaths are abundant. Mindless looking-around puzzles plague the majority of God of War 4’s puzzles. It’s exceedingly time-wasting and repetitive with its overly bulky loot system. The menu system is a piss-poor mess of convolution. The camera is uncomfortably zoomed-in far too much. There are numerous instances of confusing over-automation of character and world actions. The game has intolerably sluggish pacing as a whole. The ending is pathetic and not rewarding to the player. There is a jarring non-existence of a smooth transition from the third God of War to the fourth. God of War suffers from an overuse of derivative unnecessary RPG elements from Skyrim/Breath of the Wild.

84100,GOW2018,2018-12-23,0,"What does this game do better than any other action adventure game? The dynamic between Kratos and Atreus is so forced and it seaps into every other aspect of the game from its gameplay\, music to its story.They made it unnecessarily deep. There was nothing wrong with the arcadey gameplay of God of War 1-3."
84101,GOW2018,2018-05-12,3,"Mediocre game\, because they gave up its originality and everything that made GOW and Kratos what they are. Important note: If you're still under the effect of the hype that was created on purpose as a marketing strategy to sell this game\, you're not going to like this review. GOW games are my all time favorites\, so I had high expectations for this one since it had large shoes to fill. Unfortunately\, I ended up being disappointed\, and for many reasons if you're patient enough to read on. I'm not saying the game is entirely bad\, but for me there were many more cons than pros. I'm going to explain as best as I can:Pros:1. Good graphics that are highly detailed (even though there's a lack of impressive concepts compared to previous titles).2. I love how sassy Atreus and Mimir are.Cons:1. This game does NOT feel like GOW AT ALL. It seems like they've been trying so hard to copy The Last of US and other games that they ended up sacrificing the game's originality (and I assume for money and reviews). Nothing is unique about this GOW\, and it offered absolutely NOTHING other games didn't already offer\, so it ended up looking like a hybrid of The Last of Us\, Dark Souls\, The Witcher 3\, and Lord of the Rings!! The game had lost its unique identity we all know and love because it has changed too much.2. Predictable\, weak plot. I don't know why they gave up how angry Kratos was\, wasn't his extreme rage what made him unique? Now that he's calm\, what's so special about him? It feels like they tried to make a meaningful interaction between Kratos and his son\, but anyone could tell from the beginning that it was gonna be a typical father and son story: they would have issues\, but they would kiss and make up at the end. That was pretty much the message delivered. True\, there are some interesting plot twists\, like when Blades of Chaos came into the picture\, or when Zeus and Athena appeared\, but it seems they purposefully played on nostalgia to sell a story which would have been bleak otherwise. If you take a step back and look at the story as a whole\, you'll notice that nothing of major importance happened. 3. The new \""menu\"" system is unnecessarily overcomplicated. I think it was an attempt on their part to look smart by not making GOW look simple. IMO\, simplicity isn't a bad thing. It can make things more enjoyable.4. Kratos feels very weak. Unlike previous titles\, you will never feel powerful playing this one. He doesn't feel like a god at all. He feels like just an old man that anyone can kick his butt (seriously\, ANYONE\, including regular monsters!!) provided that they are 2 levels higher!! There are COUNTLESS enemies that can kill Kratos in ONE HIT\, and if you've played the game you know I'm not exaggerating. He struggles with regular enemies almost as much as he struggles with bosses. This game forced me to play much more defensively simply because you'll lose over and over if you play aggressively like previous titles. I even shamefully ran away from many encounters!! Kratos is a lot less brutal than he used to be\, evidenced by the way he killed Baldur (he snapped his neck which shows a much nicer Kratos than I'm used to). You'll never see a moment where you say \""Damn!! Only Kratos can do that!!\"". Most of the fights will leave you with a sense of frustration rather than a sense of triumph and feeling like a powerful badass.5. The free camera makes you feel lost. I loved the guided camera in the past and how it makes everything look cinematic. Plus\, the free camera is a huge pain during fights\, especially that Kratos can't block from all directions like he used to. You'll find yourself losing focus on the actual fight and focusing instead on turning the camera so you can face your enemies\, which takes away a lot from how enjoyable battles were in the past. Speaking of which\, there's an extreme lack of epic music!! GOW was also known for its gripping music that gets you hooked\, but this one feels like it's almost deafeningly silent from start to finish!!6. Lack of variety of monsters and bosses. They literally just change the colors and give them new names because their color is different!!7. Lack of challenging puzzles. There's basically one pattern of puzzles\, once you get the hang of it\, the remaining puzzles become very repetitive.All in all\, this game was \""ok\"" but not worth my high expectations and I definitely don't imagine myself having fun replaying it. Cory Barlog directed GOW II\, which is my personal favorite in the series. I still prefer GOW II\, so it can only mean that this one was disappointing to me. He had a huge opportunity to turn the tide without messing up the game so much\, but he failed to do so because he let his personal life affect his work. It's hard for me to say that. I'm not just some casual player. I take this game very seriously and I never imagined myself saying all that about a game that belongs to the series that I love so much.

This entry of the series claims to be a mature reinvention of a notoriously campy (despite its subject matter) series. GoW (2018) takes itself much too seriously to still have WWE-reject bosses. Games writers need to push themselves harder to make the actions of their characters (even when motivations are concealed) more realistic.

I'm not sure how the other GoW games fare\, but if they're anything like this one\, I'm genuinely surprised as to how this franchise has gotten so popular.This game is simply not worth 60 bucks. At its core\, GoW is an average parent-child bonding experience that has been integrated far better in other games. That being said\, the story isn't necessarily bad\, it just isn't as amazing as everyone is making it out to be: it's a serviceable narrative that you'll probably stop caring about halfway in.The combat mechanics of the game are actually pretty alright\, but nothing to write home about. As you progress through the game\, you unlock combos that make the game more fun and more intense\, but unfortunately you won't fight any interesting foes that'll give you a challenge. Most of the time you fight small humanoid enemies and overgrown trolls; occasionally a good boss battle will pop up\, but they are few and far between. Honestly\, the combat system of GoW is wasted on horrible enemy design.The graphics of the game are impressive\, and the scenery is truly mesmerizing\, but as you explore you start to notice the world is pretty bland and for the most part not meant to be explored. As people have already mentioned\, this game is a simple \""go from point A to point B\""\, with few detours along the way. Dungeon puzzles are rather simple and just put in to give the illusion of a well-designed world\, when in actuality the extent of these puzzles are \""throw your axe to freeze a bridge in place\, walk on the bridge\, recall your axe\, rinse and repeat\""So\, GoW is basically a linear gameplay experience that offers nothing in the way of exploring its world or utilizing its combat system against challenging foes. If you want a game that actually offers a riveting experience filled with challenges and world exploration\, try Bloodborne; if you want all that and an interesting narrative\, try Witcher 3; if you want all that and the same parent-child bonding experience\, play The Last of Us.

Throughout the game we are reminded of Kratos' past it adds depth to his character\, intrigue to his future\, and tension to his relationships. In terms of visuals this is the best looking game I have seen. The story tellingOne of the things that makes God of War so good is the way it builds on its past. It isn't really a reboot but a sequel that evolves on the previous games in the series. Throughout the game we are reminded of Kratos' past it adds depth to his character\, intrigue to his future\, and tension to his relationships. In terms of visuals this is the best looking game I have seen. The story telling is among the best in any game\, although the plot itself is a bit on the simple side. It is also the longest God of War game and nearly all of that time is well spent. There are a few weak areas that hold the game back though. While combat is good the movement through the game world is very limited and linear. The amount of free motion and interactivity is very limited for a modern game and I often found it confining. The game is among the best I have played in many areas and does only a few things poorly but its has just enough flaws to hold me back from giving it the top score.Gameplay 8 - While I grew to love the combat by the end of the game I found it sluggish at first. At the start Kratos has very few abilities and his movements are quite slow. Thankfully as the game progresses more and more abilities are unlocked and the variety of combat becomes very good. All the abilities that are unlocked seamlessly work together to improve the combat experience\, There are multiple difficulty options that can be changed at any time so you can set your pace if you want to focus on the story or the challenge. There are a lot of puzzles throughout the game and while I did find some of them to be a chore most were fun and there was enough variety to keep things interesting. Menu systems are a bit confusing at first\, there are lots of options and upgrading gear is a bit counter intuitive. My biggest complaint with gameplay is that it is very confining. The areas you move through are mostly narrow paths. For a modern game it seemed extremely limited. Kratos cannot swim and almost all motion throughout the world is scripted.Story/Progression 9 - The story telling is amazing. The dialog between the characters flows seamlessly throughout the entire experience without interruption or repetition. It really does feel like playing a movie. Last gen The Last of Us raised the standard of story telling in games and this gen God of War has taken it to the next level. The story nearly perfectly blends into the gameplay without ever feeling forced or unnatural and is paced very well. My only problem with the story is that the conclusion was a bit broken up and anti-climatic. Over all though\, it is some of the best story telling any game.World 8 - The world is beautiful and full of deep lore. Everything you encounter has meaning and thought put into it. It is a unique take on Norse Mythology and it brilliantly compliments the other games in the series. The world itself is a joy to experience but in term of interactivity it is quite limited. While the game appears large and open it is really just a lot of narrow pathways. Unlike games like the Witcher 3 or Horzion: Zero Dawn\, there are many places you cannot go. It is not an open world or even open area. It is a beautifully decorated web of pathways. The world building is amazing but for a modern game I expect more freedom.Characters 10 - Kratos has always been iconic but it the past he was kind of basic. This game transforms him from a mascot into a truly believable\, deep and fleshed out character. What is so brilliant is that it does so without sacrificing who he was. His past defines his present in a natural way. He carries guilt in a subtle way and he is full of emotional conflict. He is a strong character but he has vulnerability. There are few better game characters. Atreus is a also very well developed and the relationship between the two works very well. While the cast is quite small compared to a game like the WItcher\, the side characters are still well written and felt believable.Visual Design 10 - The visuals speak for themselves\, even without the PS4 Pro the game looks incredible. The level of detail is just amazing. Not only is it technically beautiful but artistically as well. Every area is designed with care. Each location has unique visual elements. The models\, effects\, and animations compliment each other to look even better than the cut scenes in past games. I have been waiting a long time for in gameplay to have cinematic appeal and God of War delivers that.Sound Design 10 - Everything in the game sounds good but the voice acting is the standout\, there is constant dialog throughout the game and I never once got sick of it because it is all so well delivered. Each character is perfectly captured by their voice. The soundtrack itself is also great and has its own style without ever being distracting. Sound effects were very satisfying in pretty much every area.… Expand"

The current iteration borrows heavily from Dark Soul’s\, Last of Us\, and Diablo but with disappointing implementation.

Santa Monica Studio proved it could teach an old dog new tricks\, but they laid a shaky foundation. The current iteration borrows heavily from Dark Soul’s\, Last of Us\, and Diablo but with disappointing implementation. GoW contains glaring problems fans are overlooking\, such as uneven pacing\, underwhelming story\, and frustrating combat.The shift to Norse mythology isn’t surprising. Marvel’s cinematic universe has no doubt influenced the developers. Marvel’s biggest stars include Thor\, Ragnorak\, and other Norse beings and events. GoW’s story could’ve been more interesting\, but it’s really a drawn out history lesson that presents superfluous information. The Norse world isn’t revealed thru events\, but dialogue between Kratos’ son and a severed head. Other bits of mythology or inscribed on shrines that players must locate. Unless players pay close attention to EVERYTHING that’s spoken and find every shrine\, key story elements are lost. Fans would be better served with a robust campaign that includes more enemies and deities\, better boss fights\, additional activities\, and a new game+.Ironically\, GoW penalizes players for exploring Midguard\, yet everyone pushes Kratos’ to explore. If players explore early\, they will encounter numerous obstacles which block their paths. Being under leveled is Kratos’ biggest obstacle\, however\, and he remains that way for most of the game. I completed the campaign on the harder difficulties and enemies are absurdly powerful. High levels enemies are everywhere\, and they kill in 1 hit. They also spam AOE and ranged attacks and regenerate health. Even after grabbing awesome gear\, GoW finds new ways to be unfair. So either players explore the same areas multiple times\, clearing out additional enemies and obstacles each time\, or they can simply wait until Kratos hits level 5 or higher. By then the story is over. And once the story is over\, what’s the point in hunting down additional loot?Players won’t know where they can and can’t go until it’s too late and they’re killed by powerful enemies in areas accessible immediately after the tutorial. There are often no avenues for escape. It’s better to die with dignity\, than pointlessly slog it out against a rigged system. High level enemies possess the same move sets as weaker ones\, they just hit harder and soak up damage. A level 2 Kratos against level 5 baddies is no contest. Artificial difficulty at its best which reminds me of The Division. The same few enemies are recycled throughout the campaign. The same goes for bosses. Kratos fights the same baddies over and over. It gets dull quick.Midgaurd is a central hub that branches to surrounding areas. Exploration mostly entails rowing boats or climbing walls. All areas are linear and Kratos must follow clearly defined paths. If a wall doesn’t have yellow paint on it\, Kratos can’t climb it. He can’t scale a 6ft rock\, yet he flips an entire building with his bare hands. Makes sense\, right? I had similar grips about Horizon: Zero Dawn. The developers want players coming back to the same areas repeatedly. Like the enemies\, puzzles and obstacles are endlessly recycled. There’s a scant handful of uninteresting side quests which exist solely for completionists. Several areas are merely replayable trials that pad things out. And 2 other realms aren’t accessible until God of War 5 or future DLC.Kratos’ levels up by equipping better gear that enhances specific stats. It’s similar to Diablo III\, so Kratos can alter his stats before/during each encounter. Kratos’ son is an invaluable combat asset and a welcome addition\, so max him out early on. Combat-wise\, the developers opted for a more deliberate style that tries to mimic Dark Souls. But on harder difficulties\, the combat just doesn’t hold up. Parrying an attack or activating a runic strike is risky because Kratos can be killed by enemies he doesn’t see during the wind up animations. The over-the-shoulder perspective sucks when a dozen baddies are spamming ranged AOE attacks. So deaths are often cheap because players literally didn’t see them coming. I opted for strength\, defense\, and vitality and dumped runic abilities until the end. One of the best talismans available boosts shield parrying time. That alone saves the shield from being near useless. The stun mechanic is interesting\, but at higher difficulties\, even trash mobs need tons of punishment to stun. Play on the easier difficulties and save yourselves the frustration.GoW is more DLC than a full-blown game. Although it looks great and performs solidly\, the anemic campaign\, heavily recycled enemies/activities\, and push towards postgame activities is a major turn off. As DLC\, this would’ve been an 8 or 9\, but as a standalone title there isn't much value. It’s highly overrated.… Expand"

NEVER.It's an ok game\, but that's it. It does not go beyond that. Also\, this game copies every other game that is out there: Hellblade\, Uncharted\, The last of us\, dark souls\, Zelda\, Batman Arkham\, etc. And does it very poorly._________________________________________________________________________Longer version:-ControlsClassic control map prevents you from using some of the skills (button combinations). It's physically impossible\, you will need a 6th finger. NOT THE DEFAULT MAP - THE CLASSIC MAP. It's optional\, but still.-Combat balanceif the enemies are too strong\, you simply run away/shield and use your BOI to fight. A support character is supposed to be a support character\, not a killing machine because YOU are too weak in a game. I'm a god ffs\, let me kick a$$ when I level up to max. Oh\, yea. Being max lvl with max stats does virtually nothing. You will still use the BOI way too much. I wonder who is stronger.-Camera (in combat). You see only 1/4 of the battlefield and 1/2 of it is taken up by Kratos's awesome tattooed head. They give you indicators to see attacks from behind => you end up fighting indicators instead of enemies 90% of the time. \""Lock on\"" works 30% of the time. Bugged or something.-Stats. You do more damage in numbers and you have more defense in numbers but you don't feel it. For example\, some enemies don't stagger\, when you hit them with a strong attack. It doesn't matter if you have 0 strength or 150. You're still going to hit like a little b**ch and the big guy won't care.-HitregSOMETIMES\, ok? Just sometimes it can happen that you hit an enemy and nothing gets registered. An unpleasant bug\, but still\, be aware of it. Sucks when it's an ultimate abity though.. ugh.-Loot->Best equipment is found on Arenas. Everything else is 100% useless. However\, all points of interest try to seduce you with loot. Knowing that the loot is useless\, you find no reason exploring.-Story -> You know how it's going to end. Even from trailers. It's hard NOT to guess it. + Some of the relevant characters die with 0 consequence\, some have an impact on the world for no reason. NO CLOSURE.Some realms that are in the game are closed behind a message \""Locked by Odin\""\, a.k.a. \""buy our next game\"". Disrespectful to consumers 100% +Too much unnecessary fighting to fill time. Just waves of repetitive monsters to make the game longer. Sometimes with no context. Just waves of monsters. Fun? Meh...not really.-Boss Fights:Some bosses have two random follow up attacks that are not blockable/dodgeable/avoidable\, you just have to take it and randomly die. You can find it on the forums and people simply say \""just switch to the easy difficulty for this boss fight\"". It's not fair to the players as no skill or wit gets involved. You're basically playing dice.\n\nHave a good one\, and let the hype never fool you :)… Expand"

The game makes you feel confined (some points in the game Kratos is running but moving like he's almost walking??) It just doesn't have the fluidity of the other games which makes it feel less responsive to me. I think they could have incorporated everything that makes this game feel refreshing into their model of the previous games and it would have been just fine. The overall atmosphere of the game is great and there are lots of things to really enjoy here. I support the loyalty Santa Monica has to its customers and their model of making great AAA games without any additional BS\, but just can't quite give this one the same scores as GoW 2 and 3.… Expand"

84157,GOW2018,2018-04-24,5,"Ok so lets get things started by saying that this game was long awaited\, i mean the last GOW came out 2010....so obviously the expectations were high\, so were the previous ratings (which were bought by sony (what a surprise)). (played on challenge difficulty)Lets start with the good part:The graphics and the dynamic gameplay are amazing\, the switch from cutscene to fight and the fact that you dont have a god damn loading screen is just smooth and very encouraging to continue playing. Even to the day of release i havent noticed any bugs! Not a single bug\, imagine this...The story and the background are well thought but as soon as i thought \""ok things get serious now\"" the game just ends. After the fight with the first god (which was even on the 2nd highest difficulty far too easy) and that people kept telling you that things get serious now\, the game ****** ends!! My dissappointment is immeasureable. I came like many other guys with the expectation to slaughter through the norse gods but you were granted just 1 real god fight (the other one is not worth mentioning\,Next thing i dont like is the variety of enemies\, which is sad aswell. Aside from like what\, 7 types of enemies? 80% of bosses are ogres and trolls (at least in different colors)\, sadly the color variety checks in on every other enemy too\, you got green draugr\, red draugr\, blue draugr\,... Yaawwwn. That was boring as hell.  Sadly\, the fights are weird aswell\, regular enemies are mostly harder than the bosses...?So after completing the entire game with every sidequest (collectibles aside) i only had a play time of roughly 25 hours...story and sidequests\, let that sink in for a moment.Even though the character development and the amtosphere is incredibly catchy this game just didnt convince me. Overall this is a good game\, but its not a good god of war game. Probably there will be a sequel to this (regarding the cliffhanger at the end\, and public statements) but after 8 years im not really into waiting another 5 or 6 for another game that ended midway through the story.Even if you disregard the fact that this is not a real god of war i wouldnt give more than 7 points (with gratitude)\, simply because the playing time is a joke\, and you only get 2 different weapons (cant believe that aswell).Keep giving unjustified and unexplained free 10 point ratings\, this game cant compete with god of war 3!… Expand"

Possibly the best part of the game.The story is annoying because of all the wasted potential. At no point does it explain how we got from the ending of the last game to the start of this one\, it introduces a lot of potentially interesting characters and keeps all of the interesting ones off screen because it wants to do a sequel so it just decides it won't have any proper resolution to most of the conflicts presented or show you the parts of the world it presents as the most interesting.The voice acting is surprisingly good for some of the characters\, I expected to dislike the kid but it turns out he was one of my favorites\, the main \""villain\"" is excellent too. The male lead and the female lead however are inconsistent and below average\, although the first God of War game had worse voice acting than this (although there it was on some side characters) I also loved the Dwarven brothers\, I think they genuinely had the best humor in a God of War game.The visuals are good\, with great transitions between fights and cut-scenes and really beautifully designed backgrounds. Enemy designs are visually much more boring than in the original God of War series\, but the views make up for it\, it may be the most beautiful game on the PS4.This could have been a much better game\, but it NEVER feels like a complete experience\, the combat system is introduced and then minimally expanded upon\, the story presents dozens of awesome sub-plots then proceeds to resolve exactly 3; The final boss is a good story moment but not engaging to actually perform mechanically; The visuals are technically amazing but don't have enough of an internal consistency between them\, everything looks beautiful but it doesn't look like it belongs in the same video-game.It's definitely NOT a terrible game\, but it was definitely NOT the game we were promised\, it's NOT a complete experience and it sacrifices SO MUCH to plan out sequels that it fails to resolve most things and leaves most systems feeling intentionally incomplete just so they can be expanded upon in further games.

Everything\,Mediocre. Family friendly. Average.I understand the intention - The perfect \""selling-game\"" formula has been made and now almost every AAA project is done according to it. I'll break it up:1. Setting.While playing new GOW I've had a STRONG deja vu feeling all the way through. It reminded me of everything:Dragon Age: Inquisition\, Shadow of Mordor\, Horizon: Zero Dawn.... Everything\, except for the God of War itself.I'm not a conservative type of a person but for the love of God\, sometimes you just don't have to change anything.The good ol' God of War had its face. Sure it wasn't the most beautiful face out there\, it didn't have a crazy twisted plot or something but still - it was unique. You couldn't confuse any God of War game and its gameplay with any other game. The Kratos was Charming even though he was EXTREMELY aggressive and somewhat insane - you still could understand him. As for me - in GOW 3 I was experiencing pure hatred for gods just because they were so... Ungodlike.Even compared to Kratos. This doesn't happen here\, which leads us to point #2:2. Enemies.Remember Minotaurus from any other GOW game out there? Medusa? Maybe Harpies? Sure you do.How about the... Ummm... I dont know... Maybe blue guy or... Red Golem? Maybe blue Golem? Exactly\, becauseevery. single. enemy here is FACELESS. By that I mean those were just copy-pasted and that's it.Sometimes I couldn't even tell if those are different\, because there are at least 2 green balls on a stick one of which spits acid at you and the second one heals enemies. But what are those? What is every enemy in this game?I understand the concept\, again - sure\, these are more like zombies that no one feels sorry for\, thus the game may be considered \""not as violent\"" compared to a rip-that-guy's-head-off or cut-that-god's-legs-off kind of a situation but was it really necessary? Fighting is neither fun nor memorable anymore. Which leads us to point #3:3. Fighting.Fighting? More like \""Movie watching\""\, am I right? Anyone?..Okay\, there's nothing worse in this game than this. Not the script\, not the setting or enemies or father-son relationships leading nowhere.Fighting is the weakest part of an equation.You wanted to make it \""dark-soulsy\""\, right? YOU HAVE FAILED\, MISERABLY.Whenever you fight a regular enemy - you can't tell any difference between two.Whenever you fight a regular boss - you are not allowed to participate.The default fighting sequence is \""throw an axe - combat roll - SON PLEASE SHOOT - throw an axe - repeat\"".The default boss-fight sequence is... It's pretty much the same\, to be honest\, apart from the tiny little difference that every single GOW fan wants to see here.Quick time events.You love them?You know them?You want some more of them?Now forget it. All you do within the boss-fighing sequence is \""son-axe-roll\"" situation but the most EPIC and CINEMATIC sequencesARE NOT EVEN SOMETHING YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BE A PART OF.And if you have played any other GOW part and asked yourself \""Oh god\, is it possible to kill the fun in this game?\"" - the answer is \""YES\"".Yes\, you can. Just make people watch some movie instead.As a bottom line - It's not a God of War anymore\, even though the Kratos is there\, as it might seem. But it's not Kratos\, this is a bad Kratos cosplay.Thank you for killing Kratos\, he's been through a lot and deserves some rest.Just stop torturing his dead body\, please.… Expand"

The fact that they are missing from this title really turns me off to this game.The \""level\"" mechanic is too dynamic\, there are way too many states that feel like they were tacked on to make the game feel deeper than it really is. Since when\, in a God of War game\, did I have to worry about Kratos' power level in order to harm certain enemies. Why is this even a thing?

This over the shoulder camera that makes it impossible to truly judge your footing; causing you to crash into the walls constantly. In Dark Souls\, the camera is pulled back so you can see everything in front of your character and just enough behind you that you don't ever feel like you've been hit unfairly. In this game\, you are constantly being hit from behind\, and it is most certainty the games fault. The arrows around Kratos don't work because the dodge mechanic works only half the time. In the original series the dodging was easy\, a simple flick of the right stick and you would roll in that direction. Here you have to hammer on a button three or four times before the game allows you to roll\, only to have it fail anyway. What I'm trying to say is\, Dark Souls doesn't use cheap mechanics to kill you off\, this game does.At the end of the day\, this just isn't a God of War game\, it's a Dark Souls clone that holds no candle to Dark Souls\, and I am not particularity a fan of Dark Souls.… Expand"

84175,GOW2018,2018-04-30,3,"I feel so bad for giving this a bad review but here goes. This review is written with the highest difficulty \""Give me God of War\"" in mind. The sad truth about the game is that on paper its fantastic but a series of small but annoying gameplay decisions prevent it from being enjoyable on all difficulty settings. Now before my review gets the \""git gud\"" response I'll go through everything that I found to be wrong with the game from start to finish.\""Give me God of War\"" difficulty has a few gameplay changes that from what I had heard from my other friends that the previous difficulties did not. Enemies become enraged\, gaining a level\, regaining HP\, dealing more damage\, expanding their movesets and becoming unstaggerable. On its own this wouldn't be so bad but the game quickly devolves into a cluster of camera issues and being pinned by all sides by enemies that straight up ignore your hits. Most fights devolve into running away while Atreus fires minimally damaging arrows or throwing your axe over and over till the opposition is dead.Boss fights in this God of War feel like a chore. They have\, for the most part (Sigrun) not included\, telegraphed attacks that can be dodged\, parried\, etc. But the problem lies in the design of these fights. Most of them feel extremely gimmicky and for a certain halfway fight that requires you to use the \""Stun\"" mechanic becomes a tedium of grinding the fight down over a period of several minutes. Stun on this difficulty builds up at a snails pace and makes it extremely hard to deal with said fight or any fight for that matter. Same can be said about the normal encounters.The RPG elements of level grinding feel completely off. You can tell that the developers have never really delved into RPGs because of the lack of being able to go do side quests. The first side quest you receive at level 2 takes you to fight enemies that are level 5 and above. For me\, if I am struggling with a particular segment in an RPG the normal course of action would be to go explore\, earn gear and XP then return to face the challenge. But sadly\, any attempt to stray off the beaten path for a majority of the game is met with getting stomped to a pulp by anything and everything because you'll find yourself for the most part met with mobs of enemies that vastly out level you. Which brings me to question why the game even lets you wander around in the first place.The power fantasy is gone. Never have I felt powerful from start to finish in God of War 2018. From the start\, I noticed that Kratos\, even though still a god\, had as much impact as a wet noodle. All throughout the game\, upgrade after upgrade\, I still found myself lacking any kind of meaningful damage tool. Even after finishing the game and having the best equipment available to the player\, a talisman that suits my needs\, yellow enchants poring out of my pockets\, both weapons capped\, all the skills in the skill trees. I still found myself wailing endless on enemies\, bosses and everything else unless they happened to be 2-3 levels lower than me.The optional boss fight is what really tipped me off and made me get the last cutscene and shelf the game without going for 100% completion like I normally do for these kinds of games. It gains the abilities of 8 previous optional boss fights but neglects to gain their weaknesses. The boss just does whatever it wants and has a massive health pool. As mentioned previously\, Kratos\, even with the best gear\, hits like a wet noodle. So for me the boss fight would devolve into trying my hardest to damage it while it only took 4 hits to outright kill me. This wouldn't be so different from other boss fights except that the boss has a half health damage grab that used to be telegraphed by an audio cue but no longer is\, an unblockable\, undodgeable blind that usually results in the boss using a room wide area of effect skill that outright kills you unless interrupted but you won't be able to see to prevent it. This particular instance cemented all the problems I had with the game throughout the journey. Some may ask why I picked the highest difficulty to begin with\, and personally I enjoy a challenge but instead I just felt cheated all the way through.Another small nitpick is the recycling of enemies. There is very little the game has to offer in terms of enemy variety\, most are reused all the way to the end and some bosses even show up upwards of 8 times and the executions were lackluster for the GoW series\,To top it all off\, the reward that you get for all your hard work\, drudging through the swampy mechanics and all the grindy encounters is 2 measly skins for your shield that have no impact on gameplay whatsoever and in-game XP as if you'd need it once you reach the end. No trophy nothing.In short\, save yourself the pain of a miserable experience and enjoy the game on a lower difficulty.TL:DR Bad mechanics make for a bad experience on the highest difficul… Expand"

Simply speaking\, it is nice ripe apple\, but not the apple tree which will push the genre and inspire new projects/approaches.Things which disappointed me:- low number of villain types\, killing the same kind of troll 10 times is a joke;- difficulty level does not influence villains behavior\, which is a pity. Health and numbers boost is the only difference;- combat is VERY repetitive and tiring;- puzzles are... well... they are there but unimpressive and not very evident sometimes.So I think the best way to enjoy the game is to set easy/normal difficulty level and run through the story.

I played through on Give me a Challenge mode and it was kind of a slog\, with encounters remaining very same-y throughout the end game. They do some interesting things with the axe and Atreus\, but it feels very lacking compared to the variety of all of the previous games in the franchise. I expected more.The biggest issue with this game is how the PS4's hardware weighs down the experience. Even on my Pro's \""performance mode\,\"" the game almost never reaches 60 FPS at all on 1080p\, hovering in the 40s most of the time. This is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE for any game in 2018. The 30 FPS 4K checkerboard mode looks nice when you're standing still\, but in motion\, the blur and total lack of fidelity and smoothness will give you a headache and totally detract from your experience. I couldn't get past this. The 30 FPS is constantly in your face and unavoidable\, and impossible not to notice even if you only own a console and might not know any better. I can only describe it as truly awful.This game would be an 8 or even a 9 on PC\, but as it is\, the games industry is once again held back by the primitive and outdated technology that consistently hamstrings otherwise gems like this one. Such a damn shame. Can't wait to get sold on the rerelease for the PS5 in 2025 which will only offer locked 60 FPS\, something we should already have.Not impressed\, Sony.… Expand"
