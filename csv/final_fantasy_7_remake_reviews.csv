Graphics of most places\, Characters but there are some graphics which are rlly rlly baaaad.2. Materia is still a cool thing3. Amazing summoning system of esper.4. Animation of skills etc.5. Music.6. Aerith\, Tifa and Jessie are totally gorgeous.7. If Barret is not sweating it's not Barret xD8. Barret is singing the fictory music sometimes. Totally funny.9. Bestiary10. QuestsNegative:1. Balancing is horrible. It's actually non existent.2. The enemy does not care if you hit them with a 100kg sword\,  they do not flinch nor anything at all. They just ignore your hits but only 1 slap and YOUR character flys all over the map. Most annoying stuff of all.3. 100% of the time I am walking and looking for enemy to grind some lvl but there are none and no real respawn. I was hoping to have a monster respawn when reloading the game but no there is just nooooooothing so you are walking around looing for monsters and find nothing at all to lvl up and that's the balancing issue problem here. FF7 original was an easy easy game just because you could lvl up and grind but this remake here is just garbage. Atleast no lvling way possible.4. What the h.... is this ATB stuff. I can not use items nor skills when I don't have my ATB bar atleast at 1.... who came with this stupid idea. This is the most annoying dumb mechanic I have seen in my whole life. I mean why is this crap in the game? It was not originally in the game. What kind of sadistic person came up with this dumb system? The whole battle is getting harder by a billion times just because of this garbage.5. There are quests yes but no real quest leading so you have to watch and search your stuff. There is no real arrow that leads where you have to go nor you can not put your own marks on the map to make it easier to walk to your wanted location. I mean we are in 2020 so why is this not in the game ? Marking the map like every Borderlands game has. There is a Route button but it's more a deko. When you press that button... just nothing happens. It will not show you the route where you have to go. It's just a dumb button that makes nothing.6. Graphic. Yes there are allot of horrible bad graphics in the game. It's blury like on the PS1. We are living in 2020 but you still can not read texts written on walls or books in the game. What a weak way of showing ppl some extras. When I see a note written something on it then dang I wana reaaaaad it and not see the blurry pixels on it. When deffs will finally understand that? Also what's the problem with the doors in this game? some doors look blurry as hell. Like the door where Tifa and Cloud has to sleep in the beginning of the game. They tell you a number of that flat but you can not even see it.7. Cloud and all the rest is talking stuff like Cloud is strong bla bla bla Cloud says I am strong are you sure you wana fight me ? and dies in 3 seconds. As I said balancing in this game is non existent. Why is there no monster respawn?8. You 100% ALWAYS have the aggro no matter what character you play with because the enemy turn their focus instantly on you when you switch the character and this happens 100% always when you switch. Totally annoying.I am not sure if I will buy the other episodes of this game since Jessie and Biggs has died. I am not wanting to see how Aerith dies again. Also since there are to many things that I hate and makes me very angry while playing the game.… Expand"

Makes me laugh when some people saying something like \""it's my GOTY easily\"" kind of stuff. It's nowhere near that position. Since this is \""part 1\"" of the remake project and only served as prologue in the original FFVII\, the dev team said it served as a standalone game because they expanded Midgar like never before and the game are over 40-50 hours. In actual case\, it's the filler and unnecessary long dungeon with copy and paste environment successfully extended the gameplay hours to make it seems like a standalone game\, and Midgar doesn't seem as big as promised to worth becoming a standalone game of it's own. Let's try compare this game to previous GOTY winner like The Witcher 3\, God of War and Sekiro. Oh my god it's entirely on a different tier. It doesn't even WORTH as a nominee of GOTY else it's an insult to nominee of previous GOTY.Those fanboi who defend the game saying \""this is a Remake not Remastered\"" and \""go play the original\"" kind of stuff\, let me tell you this game is supposed to be a remake as advertised\, not end up begin a sequel nor a reboot. I am not going to convince myself to like this game just because I can play as pretty boy Cloud or big boobs waifu Tifa which fanboi can be easily satisfied with whatever the dev feeds as long you can play as your beloved characters.Come to think of it\, does Square Enix has no capabilities to develop a full game now? 5 years to make the prologue of the original game with tons of fillers and copy and paste dungeon? How many more years they want to take to finish the whole project? Or they just want to milk the fan based with their nice excuses of the game is so big? Even the director and producer said they have no idea how many parts they wanted to make\, and they hope to release it ASAP but with smaller portion of the original game. Compare it with other games and other game developers\, does it really make sense to remake an all time classic in episodic style? Considering the script already existed\, the world building and visual of FFVII already established. What about other game development that need to start from scratch and how much time they used to ship their title?When we think of Final Fanatsy VII Remake we certainly not expecting content from prequel or sequel like Crisis Core and Advent Children. Sephiroth shouldn't be in this game so early\, neither his One-winged Angel Form. Flashback and Cloud's hallucinations of Sephiroth is an OK idea but they put too much Sephiroth in this game which made him lost his mystery and menacing identity in future story. And the dev team reason for that is because Sephiroth is a popular character already and they dont seem to have the point to slowly build up his character anymore. Sounds like a very bad reason to me\, the dev team just assume everyone knows about Sephiroth and therefore cut the good character development which make the villain so popular and so threatening\, one of the reason that FFVII successfully became a classic.Pre-FFVII or Post-FFVII content aren't supposed to be in this game\, at least not this early in the part 1 of the remake project. It just confused me while playing it and I asked myself am I playing FFVII Remake or FFVII REMIX. The dev team just assume everyone playing this game knows what happened throughout compilation of FFVII. These pre/post-FFVII content that include in this part 1 of the remake project just broke the immersive storytelling experience that the original PS1 classic delivered\, making the remake lose focus on its narratives. For ch.17 and ch.18\, it's merely fans service because the dev team wants to include the compilation inside this remake so desperately which resulted this game almost lost its position of a remake title.And the Nomur'ed ghost\, which literally killed the core of FFVII. If the dev team want to change the future story so desperately then just make announcement and change it. Adding plot device with alternate universe related stuff and fate/destiny theme into the story just make the game even more confusing and distract from the main course. Seems like Nomura has watched Avengers Endgame and wanted to mindf*** people with altetnate universe so badly that I doubt even he know what he is trying to do.Is it a good game? BarelyIs it a good remake? F*** offSince this game is marketed and sold as a REMAKE title\, then my score is based on how well they remake the original game and most importantly the direction they took. The only reason I didn't rate it 0 is because I want to give credit to everything that is faithful to the original. However\, the direction of this remake is a huge dissapointment\, they remake this game to do a sequel different than the original and obviously\, milk their fan based with multiple release in future.

73455,FFVIIR,2020-09-04,8,"Some spoilers ahead.Final Fantasy 7 is among my favorite RPGs\, and so I had high hopes for this remake\, albeit I was cautiously optimistic.  I'll say FF7: Re overall is a success and a fun game to play at least once.  The graphics are stellar\, and the real time battle system was a lot better than I thought it'd be\, adding strategic elements (in the form of limiting how many actions can be performed at a time).  The weapon customization/leveling was a good idea\, and enables old weapons to still be useful late game. The music is nicely remixed with nods to the original\, yet also being modern.  I like how all the fighters (except barrett) play and enjoyed switching between them.I had hoped it would extend beyond just Midgar\, but it makes sense that making the world map would be a huge feat and would lend itself better to the next installment.  The main gripes I (and other people have) is probably the pacing.  They extended the Midgar section to make this into a full length game\, which\, while it is awesome seeing the nods to nostalgia\, and certain aspects of expanding the story (i.e. Jessie's side mission\, seeing Tifa's life in sector 7 a bit more)\, the cutscenes help flesh the characters and their personalities more.  Other parts are  extended too long to make it less fun / enjoyable than the original.  Examples\, the bike scenes were annoying\, the first bike boss had too much HP and him being in the game seems out of place.  The whispers\, I'm mixed on. I don't see a consistent connection with them yet.  There are a number of scenes that ruin the pacing by being too long\, aka the long walk away from the first bombing\, aeris and cloud's underground venture w the robot arms\, train graveyard.  The biggest story pacing gripe is learning of the potential plan to drop the plate\, but the tension is killed because it takes way too long from learning of the plan to actually seeing it happen.  The party is just like \""that'd be really bad\, we need to get their asap\"" but then mosey everywhere but to the danger point.Aside from that\, certain boss battles were a major PAIN to get through.  Seriously\, the balancing or something was way off\, or perhaps there was some secret strategy to winning\, but if so it wasn't apparent at all.  Examples being the house (glad it made an appearance\, but cloud dealing 10 damage and being unable to combo cause his sword kept balancing off was...dumb and frustrating).  The large robot boss when trying to leave shinra hq\, annoyingly high hp and killer laser attacks.  Another gripe is many of these bosses had multi parts.  That can be used clever with good design (in some cases like w the behemoth)\, but per the big robo boss\, the wheels had waaay too much hp\, plus destroying one didn't do anything as far as I could tell.  So\, what is the point?  There is none other than being distracting.  The bike escape boss was annoying and took me like 6-7 tries\, I almost rage quit the game bc it was so annoying.So\, overall a good experience\, but it's not a masterpiece imo due to the pacing problems\, particularly the annoying bosses\, and loses some replayability too bc of that.  The new game + seems fun\, and I'm glad they majorly bumped exp and materia growth during it.  It's not very practical\, playing hard mode in that it prevents you from using items (it seems\, albeit I haven't tried it much).  The game had good and touching moments\, and visually it looked great\, loved seeing nods to the original and the times when they did meaningfully expand the story.  I tried to go in w low expectations so I could enjoy it\, so it was better than I expected to be.  Well made\, and fun and worth a playthrough.  I appreciate that most of the standard combat was fun\, and felt challenging (with difficulty that 'felt' fair)\, minus those few exceptions for bosses that made me rage.I think letting some chars live was eh in that it ruins the emotional impact the original had. Maybe one\, but two and not my fav? That's rough. Aside from that\, hmmm. Maybe some of the materia could've had a lower limit to level up (just so they could've been used more in the initial run through). Written in hopes that the second game fixes those two issues.… Expand"

The vision of the city of Midgar is artfully realised and stands up to the lofty highs my nostalgia has painted.But then we have theGraphically\, the game has moments where it is quite simply beautiful. The character models for the protagonists are exceptional; equally\, the lighting engine brings a cinematic quality that makes certain scenes look pre-rendered\, almost photo realistic. The vision of the city of Midgar is artfully realised and stands up to the lofty highs my nostalgia has painted.But then we have the NPCs and some texture streaming issues. In terms of the former: some NPCs looks like they should be in an open world game from a previous generation - they are woefully wooden and lacking definition. I think the devs really missed an opportunity to create a world full of stylistically coherent NPCs that match the outfits of the protagonists. In fact\, the drab and mundane attire of the Midgar’s denizens only serves to highlight how ridiculous the protagonists look: as others have mentioned\, it is like the leads are perpetually on their way to cosplay at an anime convention. Had every character dressed in an outlandish and eccentric way\, ironically\, the world of Midgar would seem more plausible. Final Fantasy XII did this well in Ivalice.The texture issues I hope will be resolved in a later patch\, but can break moments of beauty.One major high point and perhaps the most successful quality of the Remake for me was the music. The remixes and orchestral renditions of the classic songs from Uematsu often spoke to me on an emotional level. The opening cinematic: the camera leaves Areith and zooms out of the Midgar side streets\, the main theme rises to a crescendo\, as the logo flashes onto the screen. It evokes moments from my childhood. You know what I mean; it is magical.Yet the voice acting from all involved is utterly atrocious. Obviously the NPCs are bad\, much like their physical selves; but the protagonists are also over acted and misplaced. It never really feels like the actors are talking to each other - perhaps a flaw in the editing. The female characters are whiny and awkward; Baret is loud\, bordering on hysterical at times; even Cloud seems to slip into parody in his edgy portrayal some times. It’s a disappointment and I feel more could have been done to reflect the well established personalities of each of the characters.While I did enjoy the further insight into the characters through the expanded narrative\, I felt that the majority of the ‘new content’ in the Remake was unnecessary filler. Many of the side quests were simple go-here-do-this activities and really didn’t add much\, if anything\, to building a world that was already established masterfully in the original. Less is more in this sense and I feel that one or two examples of despair in the slums at the hands of Shinra would have sufficed. Yet we are made to do these utterly mundane and tedious tasks again and again in the name of what? It made the story beats sometimes fall flat and lose their impact\, a crime the original never committed.I found the combat initially enjoyable and loved the fire works\, sparks and acrobatics. The action / turn based hybrid was interesting\, but it wasn’t without its flaws. First\, I found the non-controlled characters fairly useless. It would have been nice for some kind of gambit system or a stronger AI. Second\, the combat was very easy and didn’t really require much in the way of strategy. I felt that a lot of the spells were under utilised and less effective then they could have been. Lastly\, my personal preference\, if the devs were intent on having a live combat system\, would be for more button presses to actually correspond to individual strikes - so when I press ‘hit’ the character does the first move in their combo. This is just something I would have enjoyed\, however. Overall\, combat was flashy but hollow.I\, personally\, didn’t mind the linear nature of the worlds. In fact I though that was okay in term of enabling the devs to provide a curated experience and squeeze as much beauty out of the graphics engine. Still\, I found that there were many instances that could have been cut - again\, as previously mentioned\, the game felt very padded out with filler.Ultimately\, while I did enjoy aspects of this game\, I find it difficult to recommend as an actual ‘Remake’. This\, to me\, was more of a Reboot or a Retelling. It had some of the charms of the original\, but fell short of the mark in many ways. I really feel that it was… Expand"

However\, there are glaring and consistent issues throughout the entire game that need to be addressed to and slid under the door (yes\, that door) for review.Presentation:\nThe graphics are phenomenal... for main characters and a few select other bits here and there. The first chapter has\, for the most part\, a great presentationIt's a good game and it deserves its praise as such. However\, there are glaring and consistent issues throughout the entire game that need to be addressed to and slid under the door (yes\, that door) for review.Presentation:The graphics are phenomenal... for main characters and a few select other bits here and there. The first chapter has\, for the most part\, a great presentation through environmental textures. It's when the story takes the player to Sector 7\, right after the first part\, that the graphical fidelity of the environment and the NPCs takes a nosedive. Within this area and the many areas after it\, there exist nearly four generations of graphics ranging from PS1 to PS4. It may have been passable to have such low-resolution textures for off-in-the-distance visuals but much of the awful textures are front and centre.This level of inconsistency and lack of refinement is unacceptable\, especially coming from a developer known to put a decent amount of production value into their games that are not low in budget.  There has yet to be a patch released to address this issue. The argument is that it's being run on the PS4 and its old hardware. This is true\, yet many games with similar budgets\, development time\, and linear gameplay have achieved astounding results; especially by comparison. For the lack of graphical-fidelity alone and the constant juxtaposition of high-res and low-res textures\, I've removed two points from the score making it an 8/10. JUST barely out of the mixed territory. What saved it from a 7/10 or less is the story and general presentation of that story and the characters in it.Story:I never played the first game. I knew about it and watched my brother play it but by the time I was old enough\, the PS2 came out and I played FFX as my first entry to the franchise. Likewise\, I didn't play the remaster on the PS3 so this was my first time playing the game.Although I knew a bit of the story\, it was a thrill to play the game and experience it for myself and enjoyed it all the way through. I understand the apprehension of fans for the original\, in regards to the altering of parts of the story\, but I also understand what SqEnx wanted to do with one of their most iconic entries for Final Fantasy. The characters are enjoyable and it was a pleasure getting to know Tifa\, Aerith\, Barret\, et al. The gameplay mechanics are next level. The fighting system is one of the most enjoyable systems that I've ever used and I'm looking forward to using it again in the next instalment.All in all\, the game is good and mostly great save for the caveat that is the terrible environmental textures that nearly ruin the presentation of the game save for the highly detailed main character models. What's disappointing about this remake is that the entire raison d'être for remaking it was to showcase the game\, and thus the story\, in breathtaking visuals as SqEnx intended. The reality is that the developers fell short and pushed out a hodgepodge of a graphical marvel. Parts are on par with other high-end games released this year and on the same platform\, but just as many parts are akin to PS1 and PS2-era graphics with some PS3 thrown in here and there. With the game requiring roughly 95gb of storage\, there really is no excuse for this mishap. I wish that I could give this a 10/10 but the at many times atrocious graphics\, whether by laziness or a coding error\, brings my score to an 8/10.… Expand"

This said\, it does feel and play like a tech demo\, testing the waters for the bulk of what's to come\, and this can sometimes be a bit distracting\, despite me really enjoying most of the ~35 hour run time.The game is absolutely stunning visually and sonically. I am in awe with how the team recreated\, upscaled and enhanced every aspect of the original from characters to iconic bosses/enemies to locations and the general atmosphere of the steampunk city of Midgar. I regularly stopped to marvel at the environments and the fanboy in me swooned at the incredible attention to detail. Battle visuals are stunning\, and everything just feel so alive. Wall Market is a particular highlight\, in addition to the Shinra Labs and Plate Top from the latter chapters. Everything is so charming and the magic of what made FFVII so special is captured completely. The cheesey dialogue and awkward anime-esque sighing and grunting is occasionally jarring\, but to be expected in a dub of a JRPG. In general\, the presentation of Cloud\, Tifa\, Barrett\, Aerith and Red XIII as actual companions is really well done\, and the villains are as ludicrous and animated as ever.The battle system is pretty much the outcome of more than a decade of experimentation from Final Fantasy games. The pseudo-turn based combat from XII\, the staggering system from XIII and the overall approach to action gameplay from XV. What I am completely surprised about is how they've integrated all these systems WITH the materia from the original VII and came up trumps. The game is a joy to play\, challenging and exciting with real tactical depth\, and for the first time the four playable characters are truly on par which older Final Fantasies struggled with. Inevitably\, you favour the stronger\, more straightforward characters in RPG end-games\, but I loved the way the situation of the story naturally fluctuated the team and they were all viable players. Boss battles really shine and the final two bosses of the game really showcase the utility of the system. Weapon progression is fun\, taking yet more inspiration for yet another Final Fantasy\, this time IX with weapon-specific skills. The materia system is virtually untouched from the near-perfect execution in the original and summons are powerful boss battle-specific abilites that improve upon XV's misfire. There's lots of side stuff to do (colisseums and hard modes) for completionists but ultimately a bit unnecessary.What doesn't shine in the game are side quests and every non-story related. Sure\, RPGs have boring quests but this takes the biscuit. Everything is drawn out and needlessly dull. Traversal takes a long time\, conversations draw on and on\, and nothing super interesting comes as a consequence of completing side quests\, which is a shame. The game in this respect does not deliver an immersive experience. Considering the Midgar section of FFVII is 8-10 hours maximum originally\, extending this out to 30-40 hours was always going to be hard and unfortunately there is a lot of filler between the outstanding story beats from insanely long fetch quests to entire chapters crawling through tedious sewers or warehouses. Everything from the Train Graveyard\, however\, and especially the last 5 or so chapters are absolutely fantastic.Finally\, speaking of which\, the story. I loved what they've done with the story here if I'm honest. They've ironed out some weird 90s nonsense\, gave prominence to all the right characters\, highlighted the true weight fo Shinra's actions\, and set up for what should be a different\, but riveting continuation for part two. This said\, the aspects of \""destiny\"" completely new to the new iteration are pretty terrible. I don't see how the game or story merit from it at all\, and it comes across very Kingdom Hearts babbly nonsense. This doesn't detract from the core story too much but the prominence in the latter half is a bit bemusing.Ultimately\, this game is a successful update that out-did my expectations. I was genuinely emotional seeing this game unfold in front of me and despite some weak\, boring artificial extensions to the playtime and occasional dodgy new plot elements\, this is a heartfelt love letter to FF fans everywhere that I cannot see anyone being truly upset with.… Expand"

I don't know why the user reviews are small\, and prolly it's because it was review bombed\, or the ending wasn't that great for Final Fantasy newbies/ Karens that want a 1:1 with the Original even though it is a 'Remake' not a Remaster\, Trolls\, and much more. This game deserves universal acclaim just like Ghost of Tsushima\, or at the same level with The Last of Us II which  is hot garbage. Final Fantasy VII Remake is a gem\, whether or not you've played the Original or not\, but it's better if you did.Moving on\, the combat is purely. A masterpiece. I enjoyed every piece of it when I battle someone or something in-game\, it is a blend of FFVII's turn-based ATB System (Turn-based combat getting older and less used imo) + the modern action-based combat system just like in FFXV. Simply put\, the Old meets the New. Fantastic. Seems like the devs from previous Final Fantasy really thought of something new to create this from their past mistakes. What is only a bit of disappointing though is the Aerial Combat\, but it doesn't outweigh my love for this game. In Aerial Combat\, you can't cast skills and characters need to charge up momentum to jump high and attack flying enemies. This is realism though\, this is both good and a bit.. meh. Still love it. The combat is complete\, with attack/counter/defend/etc. commands\, but with the limit of ATB so no button spamming. Hard Mode tried my patience\, you will completely renew your strategy. Plus\, Jules will make you cry lol.The graphics in-game. The cutscene quality. The Shin-Ra presentation on Chapter 17. Very\, very astounding visual quality especially the latter example. They really put forth a lot of effort in this game\, and you can't say it's cheaped out on and/or rushed. The animations in-game is good\, when you step on a rock\, when you step up\, run the stairs\, etc. but it lags matching up with the levels most of the time\, but it quickly matches up on what level your foot is on the stairs. This is VERY MINOR and not a problem\, just my observation. Also\, Cloud's sword sometimes seems to glitch out on objects when he tries to sit on benches. Again\, not a big problem. However\, there are engine bugs (they say) that causes texture issue. A very noticeable example is the door at Stargazer Heights (Chapter 3)\, where the door is almost just colored and left without further details. Also\, some things are 2D and blurry\, go closer and they will become more detailed. I hope this issue gets resolved with a patch on the future\, or an update in PS5 and PC/Xbox releases. People hating on these issues giving it a 5 or lower must sure be fun to talk to\, huh? Not quite\, they'll brag about how sharp their eyesights are. Some cutscenes\, such as the Honeybee Inn in Chapter 9\, is just fabulous.The OSTs. Oh\, you know what to expect. Masterpieces. Nobuo Uematsu + Hamauzu and others? Really love it. You will hear remade music from the original for most parts of the game\, even though the music in the original did not play on Midgar\, Remake played various remade songs from FFVII OG outside Midgar. I truly appreciate the work they put on remaking Orchestral/Electronic versions of almost every song there is on the Original.This is where most haters/trolls/kids/first-timers of Final Fantasy/ KH Haters hate on - The ending of the game. Many people left confused\, with those uninterested to further seek or dive deeper to what happened rating this game 5\, or maybe even 3\, lower or just plainly 0. The ending leaves so many questions\, keeping ORIGINAL Final Fantasy VII fans questioning. It is indeed intriguing\, and we're in for a ride for the 2nd part. The concept of the Remake being episodic is also a factor people hate this project. They're expecting a 'whole Remake' for a game that is released naturally long spanning 3 disks (Discs 1/2 were longer than the last\, because the last only contains the last remaining bosses of the game). I see this having benefits - The devs can learn from their mistakes on this Part making Part 2 have greater quality. People also complain of them spending $60 every episode is out. You don't need to be poor in order to play this episodic project. These people also prolly got blinded by the microtransactions made in their Online Games. Pathethic. Making it episodic also means the Devs are maximizing stuffs on fleshing out the lore of FFVII. In the Original\, there were many parts where the screen flashes and little to no explanations were left\, but in the Remake - a scene\, or an AI-operated cutscene will explain it to you.As far as I can say\, FFVII Remake is a really good game. They fleshed out more unexplained parts from the Original\, put phenomenal graphics\, excellent gameplay and combat\, and many more. This is easily one of the GotY Material games out there\, along with Ghost of Tsushima II and many others. Would recommend this more to those who played FFVII Original\, to lessen people whining that really didn't plat the original.… Expand"

Alle die momentan überlegen kann ich vom kauf nur abraten. Wieso?  Weil: der inhalt absolut lächerlich ist. Manche sagen es beinhaltet 15% vom original. Ich sage vlt 1% vom original. Hat man midgar abgeschlossen war es das. Wobei selbst das nur eine light version vom original ist. Die meisten dungeon artigen bereiche wie kanalisation oder U-bahn wurden gekürtzt\, rätzel und knobelaufgaben wurden gekürzt oder weggelassen. Loot truhen weggelassen oder mit heiltränken aufgefüllt.  Gegenstände im algemeinen  sind sinnfrei. Im schwierigkeitsgra normal  oder leicht brauch man sie nicht und auf schwer kann man sie nicht nutzen. Das kampfsystem ist auf leicht und normal ganz passabel aber auf schwer eher nervig. Die gegner können ganze serien von atacken starten ohne castzeit und können nicht unterbrochen werden. Der user muss aber castzeiten abwarten und kann auch noch durch jeder noch so kleinen hit unterbrauchen werden\,. Hinzu kommt das die manapunkte oder atb balken trotzdem verbraucht werden.  Ebenfalls schlecht ist das balancing  der schadenswerte. Macht man auf schwer selber zwischen 20-500 scjaden\, esper machen max 4k schaden\, hauen bosse im schnitt 3k-5k schaden raus. Bei maximal 10k life könnt ihr euch denken wieviele hits man abbekommen darf. Dazu kommt das die nicht aktiv gespielten charaktere nur rumstehen und nur selten angreifen. Dementsprechend füllt sich auch nicht ihre atb leiste\, falls also der aktive char. stirbt muss man erst fighten bis man wiederbeleben kann. Der nächste schachpunkt alle aktionen verbrauchen atb ich muss mich also immer entscheiden heile ich mich oder ruf einen esper oder greife ich an\, mit der gefahr das ich einen grossen hit bekomme und dan tot bin. Da man wärend der castzeit und der ausführung weiter schaden bekommen kann. Und meistens sogar unterbrochen wird. Nächster schachpunkt. Limit und esper skill dauern viel zulange bis man sie nutzen kann. Auf leicht und normal konnte ich sie gar nicht nutzen und auf schwer nur bei endbosse. Nächster schachpunkt\, die kampfanzahl. Es gibt keine zufallskämpfe mehr das heisst wenn ich straith durchlaufe komme ich auf max. 150 kämpfe. Viel zu wenig. Was ich auch schlecht empfinde ist das verhältniss spielzeit und film schaun. Öfters schaut man minutenlang film um dann 3 schritte zu machen und der nächste film beginnt. Videosequenzen sind toll aber ich will spielen und keinen film schauen. Minispiele wie bankdrücken funktionieren nicht wie im tutorial beschrieben Das motorad minispiel ist unschaffbar auf schwer mit perfekt abzuschliessen. Man kann froh sein wenn man es mit katastrophal abschliesst. Das kistenspiel ist zwar schaffbar aber man muss etliche versuchen starten da immer kisten kilometer wegfliegen und man alle kisten zerhaun muss um die trophäe zu bekommen. Und da für ist der timer zuknapp. Also alle minispiele sind eher nervig als unterhaltsam. Ein weiterer schwachpunkt ist das finden oder eine übersicht von nicht spielerelevanten aufgaben. Wie zb das blumengesteck beim hälmchenhof oder die sachen zu corneos brautschau usw. Ich weiss das ist absicht aber ich würde ein bischen mehr transparents beführworten. Ebenfalls nervig ist wenn man walkpassagen hat wo alle protagonisten irgendwo lang gehen die collisionsabfrage ist total sinnlos\, da das ein reines rumgestolper und geschubse ist. Durch sowas so komisch sich das anhört aber es holt einem aus dem spielfluss und man hat selten das gefühl im spiel \""drinn\"" zusein. Für mich gibt es noch viel mehr schlechtes wie zb. die musikstücke die man finden kann. Ich glaube bis auf goldsaucer theme sind alle anderen irgendwelche remixe und nicht mal halbwegs am original sind. Solangsam geht mir aber der platz aus. Ich möchte aber auch sagen das grafisch\, musikalisch und cineastisch absolut höchstes niveau geboten wird und das ist auch der grund wieso ich ff7 remake\, was eigentlich ff 7 remake trailer heissen müsste nicht 1 punkt sondern 4 gebe. Zusammen gefasst würde ich sagen ff7 remake ist zwar bugfrei und ein fest fürs aber alles andere  einfach schlecht gemacht ist. Erst recht wenn ich dafür 70€ bezahlt habe und so wie es aussieht\, für jede kommende erweiterung wieder zahlen muss.und bei der menge was fehlt wird das richtig teuer ich rechne insgesamt nicht unter1k €. Ich hoffe ich konnte euch helfen. Ich möchte aber auch noch festhalten das ich im algemeinen den qualitativen schnitt von square/enix als unter durchschnittlich bewerten würde.

73799,FFVIIR,2020-04-22,7,"I rate this game a 7/10.For decades fans of the original were clamoring for a \""remake\"" lifted to greater heights by the next generation of consoles. A great story\, characters\, world building\, and all the elements needed were already there. Unfortunately\, Tetsuya Nomura at the helm proved all of our worst fears true and his notoriously convoluted story telling was allowed to poison the remake in a fashion reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts - a giant \""heartless\"" type boss\, plot device ghosts\, and a retcon nobody wanted.The remake uses \""Whispers\"" and \""Arbiters of Fate\"" to establish that the events of the previous game are the direction that the remake is supposed to head in. This whisper element presented in the form of ghostlike creatures becomes more and more prominent as you head towards the climax. Up until Shinra tower it is a minor plot device that drives player actions to follow a similar chain of events to the original.Upon reaching the top of Shinra tower the entire story takes a massive swing into nonsense. Barret is stabbed through the chest and \""saved\"" by these ghosts because it \""wasn't meant to be\"". Followed shortly after by the worst boss battle of the game on the bridge in a boss battle with barely passible motorcycle combat mechanics. Ending in a boss battle with all aerial opponents which are a massive annoyance to fight throughout game. Whereby the player is seen defeating \""fate.\"" An element never present in the original game but all but directly stating that Nomura can now do \""whatever they want\"" with the future installments. Then you fight \""Sephiroth\"" or more accurately along the original story you fight what you think is Sephiroth.I am deeply apprehensive of Nomura using these whispers or now lack thereof in lieu of a well thought out and compelling story to give the team carte blanche to do whatever they want to change the remaining installments to an almost entirely different story now that \""fate\"" has been broken. Fleshing out the characters\, expanding the world building\, and introducing some minor changes wouldn't have required an overt statement of altering fate. This was intentionally done to allow them to make massive changes to the story in the future installments - changes which will certainly be convoluted nonsense if Nomuras history is any indication.Minor issues:- Healing outside of combat is incredibly tedious. You have to individually cycle through each heal animation from items or spells. You cannot perform this action in the menu. You must watch each individual heal. This takes so much time in a game where you're healing all the time.- Player control is yanked away frequently to enforce an incredibly linear gameplay experience. A \""cancel\"" sign will appear to force you to walk in certain directions. There were multiple times where I was watching more than playing - though this is mostly an issue upon reaching Shinra tower.- Side quests are a mixed bag. In order to “get you to want to play” the side quests most of the items you’ll actually want are the rewards (gear and materia) for somewhat tedious tasks. Some are quite enjoyable. However this manifests very awkwardly through a character named Chadley that “creates” materia and summons and he does not fit in whatsoever. Chadley is very obviously forced into the game and stands out painfully. Do not put such an awkward and poorly thought character in the future games\, please.… Expand"

Nostalgia fueled cashgrab with nice graphic\, below average combat\, poor design choices\, corridor maps\, stupid fetch/kill quests and incoherent story.\n\nI am really sad how this game turned out.

Nostalgia fueled cashgrab with nice graphic\, below average combat\, poor design choices\, corridor maps\, stupid fetch/kill quests and incoherent story.I am really sad how this game turned out. But Square shows they have issues with making a good rpg lately\, with only FF XIV as an exception.Lets start with positives though.The game is gorgeus. It really puts PS4 pro at its limits\, some locations are amazing and it doesnt run THAT bad (some places you do notice frame drops\, but thats to be expected on a console).The rest:Combat. It has lot of promise\, but Square fails to execute well. Your biggest enemy in the game is... the camera. Either you will randomly switch between targets when trying to move the camera\, or the enemy will fly high so you cant see him even tho you are locked onto him...You can use magic.... like couple times in a fight. Because you have sooo low mp\, that in Boss fights you will spend like half the time renewing your mana. Just so you can then get interrupted by an attack you didnt see coming. Mana cost of more advanced spells is just waaaay to high for magic to be viable in boss fights\, even tho in lot of them its the only way to stagger the boss (which is needed to inflict decent dmg). So you will run around\, evading attacks or blocking them\, praying for the atb gauge to fill so you can use ether to replenish mp\, so you can wait another eternity for another atb gauge to fill to use a spell. Amazing gameplay for 2020\, again.Enemy usually just targets whatever character you are controlling. No logic behind that\, seems like a simple IF statement.AI is plain retarded. Party members you dont control have no sense of where they are\, where you are\, they will often come right to you\, so you can all get some nice aoe damage\, they dont use any skills on their own (unless you slot them with materia to do so). There is no setting anywhere that would let me at least tell the game \""I wanna play offensively!\"" or otherwise.Game has no intention of telling you if you are in range or not. So maybe you think your attack is gonna hit the enemy\, but you will just plainly miss him\, bcs enemy is flying 1m above the ground and the game believes you cant reach him. Some attack skill's animations are so long that the enemy will easily reposition themselves\, or they will cast some protection spell before you land the attack.The game tries you to use the block system or dodges\, but game engine is not made for this and thus you cant cancel your animations/attacks\, so if you think your reflexes can help you... they cant. If the game sees you doing something and in the meantime enemy attacks\, it doesnt matter how quickly you dodge/block\, the game will just wait for you animation to finish and let the attack hit you. Square wants late FF games to be more action packed\, when their engine is clearly not made for this.Which leads to another point - the minigames. They are so annoying. Those mobile 'olympic games' are 1000 times more fun then FF7R minigames and puzzles. Oh how much fun it is to move containers with super lazy robot hands with wonky controls. Everything takes forever\, controls in feel super unresponsive\, and all in all its more of an annoyance than fun. Oh and if you think you can solve some puzzles your way - you cant. There is always just one right way to do it.Game design overall - you play as an ex-SOLDIER\, with superhuman abilities\, you fight guys while riding a motorcycle with sword... but you cant climb 150cm obstacle. Bcs the game doesnt want you to\, unless you do it exactly specific way (getting the first materia in tunnels on your way to sector 5).Quests - stupid\, uninteresting. Simple go there\, fetch this\, kill that. Thats it. Yes\, in 2020\, this is what Square thinks is fun. The people giving you these quests are without personality\, without anything that would make you wanna help them\, other than that its a quest. After playing some other games where some side quests are on-par or better with main scenario\, are original\, have story (yes\, looking at you\, Witcher 3)\, Square gives you garbage.Story - Im far behind half of the game\, and if I didnt know original FF7 story\, I would be lost. Villains appear randomly\, with no explanation for their motives. They just pop in\, at completely random times. You play as a eco terorist responsible for deaths of innocent people\, and you are fine with it (sure\, not entirely your fault)\, Jessie says she is sad about it in about two sentences\, and thats it. You see the unrest in the streets\, ppl talking about losing their loved ones... so what do you do? You blow one more\, ofc! Again\, game not bothering with things like guilt\, the fact you play as a terrorist\, killing innocents... no one cares.It had so much potential. Square botched it… Expand"

(Mind you I am a turn based lover so my expectations for this game went down when the combat was revealed and thus I feel I care a little less than most what way the story goes) Ill always have my original ff7 so I am not too concerned\, thus I feel meh about the story changes and it goes into the mixed feelings pile.Cut-scenes\, Many of the cut-scenes in this game are great and look fantastic but there is too bloody many of them\, it has gone for that cinematic approach that every big game these days has to do for some reason\, so expect to play 10 mins\, watch for 5\, play for 10 more mins\, watch for 3\, play for 15 mins watch for 2 etc\, a very 'stop and go' gameplay that I always hate\, It is worth noting that there are a few chapters where this eases up thank god.Hated:Linear corridors\, so much linearity in the game\, Nearly felt claustrophobic at times\, I am aware Midgar was linear in the original but the original was not broken up into parts and expanding Midgar into 30 plus hours! open it up a bit if your gonna expand it this much like. Also while on the topic of Midgar\, it was not nearly as large as I was expecting given how expanded square enix claimed this game was as well as promising it was the length of a full fledged final fantasy. they obviously didnt mean any of the recent ones.Padding. The game has no shortage of it\, the sidequests are mostly fetch or kill quests that do little to add to the game but I could have put up with them if not for the god awful slow walk speed in this game constantly\, the game never makes up its mind\, sometimes you can run\, other times you can jog\, other times you can only walk slowly\, sometimes you can swing your sword to break boxes\, other times the game wont let you swing the sword\, it all happens nearly at random. This is one of the most annoying things about the game\, its so restrictive\, like as if i am playing an interactive walking simulator sometimes\, This is needless slowing of the pace and dragging out the game. There are 2 exceptions where I felt the forced walking was justified but I wont spoil. I wont even get started on all the damn ladders and shimmying across between ledges and squeezing through tight spaces really slowly\, that combined with the above really slows the pace and seriously hurts the replayability of the game. I threw my eyes up to heaven every time My character suddenly slows to a crawl because someone is speaking\,Level design\, Level design is very uninspired for the most part\, leaving aside the linearity mentioned above\, some of the areas that do open up a bit are large square rooms with trash mobs in them followed by a tiny corridor and another large square room. over and over\, very very basic level design stuff here. Uninspired but you know what? Ill take it over being forced down another damn corridor and sometimes I got to at least choose the order in which I entered these rooms so thats a start :)Blue arrows pulsing on the ground guiding you so you dont get lost......this is bad in ANY game but how in the name of god would you get lost in this\, its like getting lost in a 2d mario game\, at least give the option to turn off immersion breaking bright blue arrows on the floor.

(Before anyone says anything\, a 10/10 does not mean a game is perfect; it does mean it is a masterpiece and deserves to be part of your gaming library.)FF7R does a daring approach to combine its modern action-based gameplay seen in more recent games like FF15 and the Kingdom Hearts series\, with the classic menu-based approach of more traditional FF games. The result is a big payoff as it creates an exciting\, yet tactical based style of combat that slows down time to a crawl when selecting Menu abilities for your spells\, items\, and big ticket attacks. This style of combat feels like a true evolution of both the traditional menu and action-based gameplay.Those familiar with the story and characters of FF7 will largely know what to expect\, but FF7R throws a few curveballs here and there that will take everyone by surprise. Secondary characters from the original game have been expanded in the narrative\, and new characters are also introduced and play significant roles as the story unfolds. The characters are surprisingly well acted in English\, save a few cringey lines and hammy delivery (more of a script problem than the actors themselves\, honestly). Overall it's the characters that are FF7R's strongest aspect\, and they will leave a lasting impression on the player.Whatever criticisms anyone has of this game\, almost everyone can universally agree on one thing: THE SOUNDTRACK IS PHENOMENAL! Nobuo Uematsu REALLY flexes his musical muscles in this game\, as there is a huge variety of tracks and remixes that will never sound repetitive! If you are an audiophile like myself\, you will buy this soundtrack immediately after finishing this game!Now to talk about the flaws of the game. The camera angle is awfully close and can be a hassle in small spaces. There are some sections of the game that definitely feel like padding. Some of the NPCs can look like marionettes instead of actual people. And finally\, if you're an old FF7 fan expecting this game to have the entire story in one go\, you're not going to be happy. This game takes place exclusively in the Midgar portion of the original game\, albeit it has been expanded in scope to a massive degree. The sheer level of detail and content added to Midgar does justify the game being split\, as from a development point of view\, there is no way a full FF7 with this much scope could possibly fit in one game\, let alone be worth only $60.The ending is also going to be controversial\, as from this point is where it deviates from the original story line. It should be noted that FF7R was intended to actually be a sequel - you'll find out why as the game unfolds.All in all\, this game's flaws are overwhelmingly dwarfed by its positive aspects. This has so far been my most enjoyable gaming experience in the first half of 2020. Even though the deviancy in story at the end concerns me as a long time FF fan\, part of me can't wait to see what the rest of the Remake series has to offer.… Expand"

For those people I recommend the original Final Fantasy VII which exists in all major platforms right now.For the rest of the people this game is a mindblowing experience.Characters and cutscenes are gorgeous and voice acting is top notch with great lipsync. Music fits really well everywhere in the game and makes it feel like a movie both in battles and in cutscenes. For the players of the original there are tons of references to smallest of details in the original throughout the game and I was mindblown all the time to the attention to detail they have had.How they have expanded the existing story feels really good. There is a solid character progression storywise for all main characters. The sidequests are also designed so that you learn of the world at the same time so while some may be tedious they help you learn something about the world and its people. They have included stuff also from other works relating to FFVII and they fit in really well.Battle system is the peak perfection of any Final Fantasy with solid tactical element in an action game. Especially in the end game content you have to rotate characters well and use their abilities really well. Boss Battles are challenging and require you to adapt to new situations without still feeling frustrating. There are some really nice optional bosses that push you beyond your limits.Character development systems work really nicely. The materia system allows customization like before. There are some new additions to materias along with many old ones. I was first sceptical about the weapon upgrading system but it adds a lot of customization and choice to your development.All this is not to say that the game doesn't have some flaws. Some textures can be really low quality and blurry ( especially doors have this problem ). The design choice to avoid loading screens for a better flowing gameplay comes with a cost of long narrow roads and tight spaces where you have to crawl slowly to move from area to area. This means that there are slow and annoying parts even when PS5 launches. Upgrading weapons can be tedious with the upgrade section opening animation and seemingly randomly moving cursor in upgrade screen. It can also be really tough to grind levels as monsters are hard to respawn and battle places are far from each other.However\, the abovementioned small annoyances didn't distract me enough to take away from the experience. In fact\, all those will likely be history in the next part of the series as the game likely takes turn to more open world exploration based storytelling.The game held me tightly in its grip throughout the whole experience. Story took me 47 hours to finish since I like exploring. Currently going through the endgame content with clock showing 60 hours and still absolutely loving it. Looking at the list of things to find I expect total playtime to go to about 100 hours.I'd give the game a score of 9.8 but rounding it up here to 10. My favorite Final Fantasy games so far have been VII\, IX\, X and XII in no particular order but I must say that Final Fantasy VII Remake is definitely joining them.Definitely recommending this to any open-minded gamer who doesn't expect every game to be free open world exploration. There are many things this game does spectacularly well.… Expand"

73958,FFVIIR,2020-08-25,9,"You won't find a more anticipated remake in recent memory quite like Final Fantasy VII. The pressure of remaking such a beloved classic all the while still meeting fan expectations is daunting\, to put it lightly. FF7's reputation precedes even the game itself\, being one of the pioneers that put JRPGs on the map in the West\, and making the series a household name. Ever since the PS3 TechYou won't find a more anticipated remake in recent memory quite like Final Fantasy VII. The pressure of remaking such a beloved classic all the while still meeting fan expectations is daunting\, to put it lightly. FF7's reputation precedes even the game itself\, being one of the pioneers that put JRPGs on the map in the West\, and making the series a household name. Ever since the PS3 Tech demo people were asking the same thing\, \""Where's the FF7 Remake?\"". 13 years later\, they finally delivered...well\, part of it at least. Even though the game only covers up to the first two hours of the original FF7\, they somehow managed to stretch it out to a full 40+ hour experience. Did Square Enix succeed in their efforts? For my money\, I'd certainly think so.The two most controversial changes that Square made to FF7 was in its story and combat. While the story follows many of the same beats as the original\, certain sequences are told out of order\, future plot details are given away early\, and new story elements were added either to flesh out characters or turn things over its head. Some of the changes I felt were for the better\, while others are definitely questionable (especially in regards to the endgame)\, and a lot of the new additions really helped to flesh out the characters more\, especially ones we never got a chance to really get to know in the original. The main party characters like Cloud\, Barrett\, Tifa and Aerith are all wonderfully characterized in this game\, and each are given many stand-out\, hilarious and heartfelt moments.Combat is the other huge change. It's no longer traditional Active Turn-Based\, but it's not straight up Kingdom Hearts like many feared. It's kind of a hybrid between the two. You'll use two attack buttons to build up your ATB meter\, and then you can either slow time to a crawl to plan out actions or set actions to command shortcuts. The combat itself is fast-paced and satisfying. Each of the characters has their own unique playstyle\, and you'll need to utilize their different quirks in order to successfully take down enemies. Party AI on their own won't do that much\, so you'll need switch it up. Some will call it a detriment\, I say it keeps things far more fresh and interesting. The materia system is still intact\, with some additional upgrades you can make to all of your equipment to really maximize your potential. It also goes without saying that the game looks positively gorgeous\, and FF7's already phenomenal soundtrack is given a great modern facelift. A majority of the boss fights are an absolute treat. Their climactic\, challenging\, and often towering foes that really test your abilities.The game is certainly not without its faults. Most of the sidequests offered throughout the game are\, frankly\, uninteresting. Most of them tend to boil down to\, \""find the thing\, then another thing\, and then come back\"". I ended up doing these side quests not because I wanted to\, but because I knew I'd be at a disadvantage if I didn't. To be fair\, things start to get a bit more interesting once you hit The Wall Market. Another issue would be the general dungeon length. I'd say the top of Sector plate onwards is when they start to seriously drag on. On more than one occasion I had to ask myself\, \""When is this gonna end?\"". Also\, for as beautiful as the game is\, there are still some gross parts like certain objects not loading textures properly or some the skylines being obvious 2-D images. I also mentioned how some of the later plot details and changes can be considered questionable and controversial. It all depends on how open you are to these changes and accepting the fact that this isn't going to be the same story as the original.FF7R is not substitute for the original\, nor would I say it's outright better. It's simply another version the cozily sits along side the original and is there for those who want to be given a brand new experience\, rather than just a simple retread. Personally\, that is the mark of a really good remake. If you are not a fan of what FF7R has to offer\, you still have the original to fall back on no problem. If you have yet to experience FF7 for what ever reason\, I'd say go ahead and play both. They are both great games for different reasons\, and which one you want to start with is up to you.… Expand"

As an avid fan of the original\, FF7 cemented my love of the genre.  But this game has deleted that love.I'd summarize this game by say it is an exploitative attempt to turn a fan favorite into a $300 cash cow.  They will do that by making 3-5 releases and DLC.The original was great mostly because of the story\, gameplay\, and for me...the summoning.  This game fails in all departments.1) Story:  It is so bad I actually invented a new term for it.  Non-resonant drama.  It means that things happen...but you just don't care.  People die...but I didn't feel for them.  The characters are all flat.  Cloud never changes his expression.  Barret is a bad caricature of an 80's black man.  Tifa is the default female but can punch.  Aerith is the default female but loves flowers.By attempting to make a full game from the very first mission of the oringal game\, they needed to add 38 hours of filler content.  And that's what this game is: Filler.  Here is a quest to go back to all the places you already went but this time there will be a boring fight to deal with.  Now run back.  Not fun.2) Gameplay:  You attack by holding square.  And you block by holding R1.  Wow\, how original.  You can also roll.  Cloud has 2 attacks that you switch by pressing triangle and switching stances.  It is a chore to do so.  You can be interrupting during you spellcasts.  You lose the mana AND the energy bars it takes to cast if you get interrupted.  I've never seen this in a game before.  It's the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced while casting a damn heal spell.  Every single action requires a pausing of the game.  And your companions AI is terrible.  They will only heal you if you fill up a materia slot with a \""cure-me\"" materia...and then only when you are almost dead.3) Summoning:  I'm 40 hours in an I've used it 3 times.  Because that is all that I've been allowed to.  You can't summon except in certain boss fights...and even then only after the bar RANDOMLY fills up.  You CANNOT choose which monster to summon.  And their abilities require you do pause the game and use up an energy bar of your own character.  Makes no sense.  Then they do this really lame final ability before they leave...and it looks and feels bad.  Just a bunch of swirling fire on the screen...sure whatever.I've almost uninstalled it 3 times because I guess they consider avoid being chain slept/stunned/knocked down fun.  But I've lost the game to being chain stunned.  And they are long stuns...talking 5-10 seconds of doing nothing.  Usually you can swap characters during this....but only if you have more than 1 in the party.Speaking of AI...you only control 33% of the party.  The other 2 are controlled by AI. Sure\, you can spend their mana...but mostly...the game plays itself.  Not what I wanted in an RPG.You can't change their appearances at all except their weapons.Leveling up weapons is so lame and tedious that they created a way to have the AI do it for you.This isn't an RPG...it's a bad commercial for Square.

But considering how you could get out of Midgar between 6-8 hours and this whole first part is covering Midgar...well\, you can guess that a lot of stuff is expanded upon.Overall\, it's well done and the story didn't stretch thin for me. My only complaint would be the \""mysterious figures\"" showing up to kill the pacing or act as a Dues or Diabolos Ex Machina. Sure\, their appearance gets explained later in the game and then you can probably see what they're going for...but it still isn't great and I hope it is done away with in future parts.Characters.Personally\, I enjoyed all of the important characters. Party members\, villains and allies. Banter between them is fantastic and I can't recall the last time I laughed out loud because of it in a video game. There were a few characters who I was pretty \""meh\"" about\, but they all appeared in side-quests anyway\, so that's all optional.Combat.It might not be for everyone\, but back when I played the turn-based Final Fantasy games this was always how I imagined it going. You can also control all characters\, instead of only being stuck with one like in FF XV (Unless I'm remembering that wrong).Overall\, it feels pretty good to run around the battlefield hitting foes or casting magic and having some degree of control over your party members. As far as I know\, you can also make some pretty broken Materia combinations. Which is fun.Graphics.All the important characters look very good and are easily recognizable to those that have played the original\, Midgar itself is also highly detailed! Unfortunately\, the NPCs vary in appearance. Those that you speak to for side-quests look about the same as the important characters\, while there are some background characters that look like they belong in a PS3 game. Midgar itself is also varied\, there's a lot of grey and brown\, of course. But certain areas also look gorgeous.Sound.Voice acting was excellent and I loved the music. My only complaint would be all the background characters chattering. It helps in making the game feel like it's alive\, but it can get quite annoying to hear three conversations blend together while Cloud and his party members walk and talk.Replayability.After finishing the game\, you unlock a \""Chapter Select\"" screen and replay chapters with your current level\, equipment and materia. And you unlock Hard mode as well. Playing in this mode gives you access to things you can find in other difficulties\, which is something I still all need to find out myself.Final Verdict.Although there were *some* bumps in the story I wasn't very pleased about and the game itself *feels* short (which is weird to say for a game that's between  30 and 50 hours long) I'd still say it deserves a 9.I would be lying if I said that I wasn't concerned about what Square Enix has planned for the future parts\, if we have to pay full price for them\, if we can download them for free\, buy them like expansions or whatever. But for now\, I won't let that colour my review.… Expand"

Stunning visuals\, outstandingA wonderful soundtrack and some breathtaking visuals start the game off on nostalgia driven high notes. Add to that some poor game mechanics\, even poorer pacing\, and an increasing stale battle system\, and you have one of the most anticipated video games of the year falling flat on its face.The game starts with what every fan of FF7 wanted from this game. Stunning visuals\, outstanding music and a verbatim opening mission that lead many\, myself included\, to believe this was going to be a remake in the same vein as what Capcom did for Resident evil 2.  But just as quickly as the hopes came they soon dashed away. The battle system\, while being entertaining at first quickly devolved into a weird combination of hack&slash and micro managing. As an Action RPG you attack\, dodge\, and fill up special gauges in real time. You\, however\, control only 1 of 3 party members at any one time. The other 2 will barely react in the interim causing the player to have to constantly take control and manually move and queue up attacks. This  simply makes the point of moving away from a turn based system bizarre at best and inconsiderate at worst. And to drive home the point that the other 2 party members are basically statues the enemies you fight rarely target them instead focusing on the player character no matter who that be. So if you were hoping to switch to a healing character and get a more objective view of the party you are out of luck.The Main character design and immediate level artwork were immaculate. Absolutely breathtaking.  But it was soon obvious that’s where the bulk of the processing power went. the background and deep scenery were prerendered paintings which was only really of note because they clashed so wildly with the characters. By characters\, I of course mean just the main ones as well. All the NPCs look decent enough to be in a ps3 game at best. Luckily they look right at home with their immediate background and surroundings lacking ps4 quality textures.The biggest problem of note however was the awful pacing of the game. As many know this game took the first 5 or so hrs of the original and stretched it to 35. How they did that left me scratching my head more often than not. I first noticed on an early 90minute long mission with my new avalanche buddies learning their motivations. I thought if this type of content is what I’m getting with a new game and 60 bucks I’m all for it baby give me a slice of that pizza. But then I realized that was the major extent of the extra content. The rest of the added 23 hours were either (forced) Slow down  walking sections while I listened to the usually well done voice acting speaking what I could have read in a fraction of the time\, or I was tracking down kitty kats or chasing fish frogs through a sewer for a key. All this was punctuated by extreme cut scenes of urgency\, explosions\, and blossoming friendships.  I have never felt such a hurry up a wait mentality before in a game.If you are a fan of the original FF7 this game might just scratch that nostalgia itch. If you are trying to find a new game to sink your teeth into this one probably isn’t the one for you. I left this one feeling oddly similar to how I felt during FF13 in terms of story structure and level design. So if you liked how 13 was put together with the possibility of having a partial FF15 style combat then give this one a try and you might just love it. If not\, wait until it goes on sale or to your local library to rent it. 5/10… Expand"

Otra de esas sombras en el juego son aquellos momentos donde la cámara se mueve a placer. ya sea por algún punto de control donde quieren mostrarte algo\, o el camino a seguir\, que está muy bien\, pero no cuando te arrebatan el control de la cámara por largo tiempo para mostrarte un lugar o edificio que se ve en 2 segundos y no necesitas 30. En cualquier caso\, el juego en el apartado jugable está bastante pulido y por lo general se siente dinámico y fluido.GráficosEn el apartado gráfico sin duda nos encontramos ante un portento. Por lo general las texturas son de alta resolución\, están bien implementadas y es un gustado observar detalle. Pero también tiene sombras\, apartados poco trabajados que son fácilmente reconocibles ya que se recogen en 2 supuestos. Cada vez que miramos desde las barriadas a la plataforma sobre nosotros\, observamos texturas de poca calidad\, borrosas. Cada vez que miramos desde la plataforma al suelo a las barriadas\, Nos ponen una especie de collage de edificios sin perspectiva\, completamente plano que te sacan un poco de la historia y la última son las lejanías que tenemos el mismo problema 0 detalle. Digamos en en distancias cortas y dentro del mundo pasillo creado para que recorramos gráficamente es alucinante\, más allá\, todo elemento visible por el jugador da pena verlo.MúsicaNo me considero muy fan de la música de los Final Fantasy porque en numerosas ocasiones me parece que no pega la música con la acción que estamos viviendo. Entiendo su significado en FF de los años 90\, a si que lo voy a entender en este remake y en el contexto de los Final Fantasy\, entiendo que está bien aunque no me enamore.Historia- La historia me ha gustado bastante\, sigue la tónica de cualquier FF\, una lucha contra un mal superior y los héroes que emprenden dicha lucha. Los personajes me han parecido muy carismáticos y no resulta difícil empatizar con ellos. Los enemigos se vislumbran rápido y quedan envueltos por ese aroma a villano clásico que siempre me ha gustando.Duración- El juego\, directo y sin hacer misiones secundarias unas 23 horas. Por lo que entreteniéndote un poco con él y haciendo algunas de las misiones que te proponen sube rápidamente a 30 horas. Creo que es preferible un juego disfrutable en 30 horas a uno de 100 horas. Yo no estoy en contra de que hayan decidido fraccionarlo siempre y cuando sea una causa justificada y en este caso me ha parecido un juego completo estas 23 - 30 horas jugadas.TaducciónEn el apartado del doblaje nos encontramos el mayor punto negro. En primer lugar no tiene doblaje al castellano que por supuesto ya por sí mismo es un punto negativo. Nos encontramos ante una copia en inglés. Almenos en inglés las voces están muy bien acompañadas y siguen ese aspecto jovial del juego\, pero los subtítulos en castellano son una auténtica pesadilla. No dan una\, se inventan las cosas respecto a la versión en inglés. Te de adelantan otras que no están diciendo los personajes. Omiten información\, otra directamente la endulzan para que sea menos duro sin entender el motivo real. En definitiva un auténtico desastre. Es una indignación estar escuchando a los personajes en inglés y ver que los subtítulos no corresponden en absoluto a lo que están diciendo. No entiendo como pueden traducir un juego en modo \""traducción libre\"" es incomprensible\, ¿Os imagináis una película o serie donde los subtítulos siguen una pista a la película o serie original pero sin decir lo mismo?

Next I'll say that the original FF7 was THE GAME for me that basically got me into gaming\, I'll still say it is probably the best game ever made.  Thus I had high expectations for the remake\, and I was always worried about how this was going to be executed.In short\, it's amazing.  It's almost a masterpiece\, but doesn't quite reach the heights of the original. And could it ever? No.  And that is because it's only a tiny piece of the original.  If they remade the FULL game with this level of quality then yes\, it would be a masterpiece.The characters in the game are honestly brilliant\, with Tifa by far being the best with exceptionally good voice acting.  It's great to see an expansion on some of the peripheral characters such as Jessie.  For the first time in a long time\, I really cared about the characters in a video game.Graphically the game swings from amazing with brilliant characters models but then to the outright awful with poor textures in some of the environments.  But overall I'd say this was a great looking game.  The summons in the game look fantastic\, with Shiva being the highlight for me.Music wise the game is amazing\, the production here is second to none.  That opening scene\, wow\, just wow.  TURN IT UP! The music really adds to the atmosphere and for the most part plays testament to the original.  There are a couple of missteps music wise\, with wall market being my least favourite with cheesy techno pop.I love all of the little details the developers have put into this\, such as Barret humming the tune that used to play at the end of each battle in the original.  I laughed the first time he did it.  On the topic of humour\, there is some of that too.  Cloud constantly belittles Barret in the first few hours of the game as their relationship develops\, these scenes made me laugh too.Now onto the combat...wow...it is simply amazing.  It is so dynamic\, deep\, and strategic.  It takes a while to uncover its full potential but when you do and everything just clicks it’s a real joy to play.  The only bad point about the combat is in literally one or two battles there can be just a little bit too much going on which I found personally overwhelming at times.  The camera angle doesn’t help at times.  But this is really infrequent and did not negatively impact my experience with the game.I'm really enjoying hard mode\, I really like how it forces you to think much more strategically about your use of materia especially in light of how you cannot use items...ever.  Playing through on hard mode is allowing me to further uncover aspects of the combat I never realised in my first playthrough.There are lots of reviews that mention filler.  I would generally agree with this but at the same time I enjoyed the break from the pace of the story to learn how the combat works.  But I think Square could have been more innovative with this admittedly.  I didn’t think these were ‘bad’ parts of the game\, they just weren’t on par with the quality of the rest of the game.There are so many good things about this game I find it hard to understand some of the insanely bad reviews some of the users are giving it...0? Really a 0?!  You have to look at the overall general view\, a Metacritic user score of 8 for a game that was always going to be VERY heavily scrutinised is extremely good.It's disappointing to see so many comments disappointed by the ending and some of the story changes (honestly it is not that drastic).  At first I was somewhat confused by the ending but as I thought about it more it makes sense really - without giving too much away all Square are trying to do here is expand upon what COULD happen in the next few parts.  It leaves you wondering where they are going to take this next and I personally enjoy the mystery.  I’m glad it’s not going be scripted and predictable – because if you think about it where is the fun in that?  I doubt very much they will deviate from the original story too much but I do expect some surprises along the way if the ending of the remake is anything to go by.Now all I can do is look forward to the next part and hope that it is as good as this.… Expand"

This easily has the worst textures I've seen in a triple-A title this console generation. The only exceptions are the early and late game environments\, possibly due to the low-key lighting\, making the texture issues less noticeable. In many of the game environments\, textures lack simple bump maps. They're insultingly bad for fans of the original who have waited decades to see this project come to fruition. The character models are very nice\, but that's about it. There are moments when the textures are literally comparable to PS2\, especially in the sector 5 junkyard area. That's not an exaggeration.The side quests are throwaway \""fetch quests.\"" The hard linear nature of the game takes away from the experience of the old final fantasy games that opened up near the end\, giving you the chance to explore the world and build your characters. That never really happens here -- you can only explore one sector of Midgar near the end.The combat is fun at some moments and a klunky mess at others. It's so easy that you'll never face a significant challenge in the game (i died 3 times in my entire playthrough). Because of this\, there isn't the necessary level of strategic depth that the original had; for example\, I never had to use an item to remove a status effect because they rarely affected battle in a significant way. The most common ailment was the toad status\, which you can ignore for literally a few seconds until it wears off naturally. Never used a \""remedy\,\"" \""smelling salts\,\"" \""echo screen\,\"" etc. By extension\, status defense materia and skills are arguably useless.The worst part of the battle system by far is the camera; despite changing the in-game settings\, enemies frequently go off screen or block your view\, and when you try to reposition the camera with the right stick you end up targeting a different enemy. We had the same camera issue in the last single player final fantasy title\, and SE is simply not learning from past mistakes.Fanboys will jump on the bandwagon\, but those who judge the game according to current standards and not based on nostalgia for the original will have a hard time calling this a GOTY contender.P.S. Worth noting that there are tons of annoying narrow passageways you need to squeeze through in this game. They're almost constant. Of course\, they're really hiding loading screens. This game should be much better optimized given that it's offline\, segmented into chapters\, and so incredibly linear. Maybe SE should worry less about making Cloud's hair so damn pretty (his hair literally has collision detection) and worry more about building a game with functional environments that don't force you through narrow passages every 10 minutes and textures that don't look like they're 15 years old. Maybe actually texture a rock or a door every now and then. Just a thought.… Expand"

You need to be good at materia management and MP usage\, good for strategists. Chapter selection also helps a lot for those trying to get platinum. Overall a lot of quality of life systems. Easy menus\, upgradable weapons\, upgradable materia and all that add to a solid RPG system.- Characters: what can I say besides they carry the story like the original? They are great\, just as I remember\, hell\, the main crew is better than ever. The side characters\, especially the rest of Avalanche are miles better and the new additions are interesting.- Story: it's the old story with an added element that changes things. I like it\, it gives a twist and by the end it gets me thrilled. I'm excited for what's to come and how is SE going to deal with what they added. Been watching a lot of podcasts reviewing this ending. It leaves a lot to discussion and that's great\, makes people connect\, think\, scratch their heads.- Graphics: outside of some textures glitches (looking at you Sector 5 Slums) it's a pretty game\, up to the best of this generation of consoles.- Soundtrack: I don't know how\, but the bastards gave an even better soundtrack than the original. It's amazing. It gets your heart pumping in boss battles\, it gets you emotional when it needs to be and sometimes it feels like it's own character in the game (especially when it's throwing you hints\, mainly by the end of the game).I have some minor issues with the game\, thus the 9/10.The Whispers (\""Plot Ghosts\"") are fundamental to the new flavour added to the story\, but for the most part they're just an annoying mechanic. Can't help but feel that the game could add this new flavour without them.Sometimes the pace really goes down and some side quests\, even though they add character and world building very well\, are just weak.SPOILER: Going back to the sewers just to get some grappling hooks and a bit more of Leslie's story is just very weak writing. In the original how we go up the plate is also goofy\, but  hey\, at least you don't have to go through the same level and fight the same boss (even though it's a nice battle).I see a lot of people in a tantrum because they feel misleaded or because they think everything is going to be extremely different from here on out. Most of it comes from the more recent works of SE. And they're right on that. It's hard to trust a company that has failed more than once in its storytelling\, but this is their Holy Grail. This is the piece of work they have the more respect and love. I believe they will work with bot nostalgia and the feeling of new adventures\, and that to me is just how it was supposed to be.For the people that are outraged I would just say\, breathe a little\, give some space to the developers. 95% of the first part of this Remake hits the right notes and goes beyond that. Why would you even think the rest wouldn't be like this?… Expand"

Firstly\, I have 100% the original FF7 many\,I have only played the first 8 or so hours of the game\, but so far I would score it between 9 0-9.5 out of 10. The reason I scored it a 10 was to balance just some of the ridiculous things I have seen it scored a 0 for. For example\, one guy slammed this game because they dared to change a sign in Tifa's bar....Regardless\, time for the review. Firstly\, I have 100% the original FF7 many\, many times\, it was my favourite game growing up as a child\, and I wanted a remake/remaster basically since about 2002. It was only after it finally got announced (and I finished dancing around the room) that we got the news that it was going to be in instalments. I.e. they were going to be finishing the first game in midgar. I was so disheartened that I genuinely felt robbed of that glee. But I am not ashamed to admit when I am wrong. This game so far has exceeded my expectations in every way. I truly thought they had no chance of pulling this off. FF7 is 23 years old and I didn't think that there would be enough in the game to extract and make a satisfying modern game\, while keeping the traditionalists happy. Again\, I was completely wrong.The combat\, I really enjoy\, there isn't much need to do more than button bash\, but I like to use all abilities just because it looks awesome. The stagger mechanic makes a return which again is a welcome addition. I think people will either hate the combat\, or be okay with it. I highly doubt many will love it\, but it definitely is fun so far.The story and world have been built upon so much in a way that has me constantly smiling. I absolutely love the focus on jessie\, biggs and wedge. I can't imagine they had more than 10-20 lines in the original\, and yet they have taken centre stage for the first chunk of the game.There are two types of sequence. There is the first\, where the sequence originally existed in the game\, and these are a genuine mind-blowing experience to die hard fans. And then there are the sequences that are brand new. Of the brand new stuff\, there is some filler for sure\, this is a JRPG after all. But running around and doing filler as Cloud\, Tifa and Barrett is awesome so far. I genuinely avoid modern JRPGs and I especially avoid the filler if I do give them a shot. And yet I did every side quest so far.The voice acting so far is excellent\, with the exception that Barrett is quite annoying (however\, I think this is on purpose) as if you are familiar with his character arc\, you know the source of his anger\, and you know he shows probably the most growth.The music in the game is given much needed rejuvenation. The songs are essentially the same but played out with modern instrumentation and recording\, instead of that midi sound. I think they have done a stellar job.The negatives are few and far between. Firstly is the glaring missing textures\, I can only assume this will be taken care of in the future. But often a dialogue will take place in front of a door that has not loaded the texture and it is quite off-putting\, however\, I am sure many won't even notice. Secondly\, the filler quests that I did certainly could have had more substance (even though I like fighting as cloud)\, so far they amount to \""go kill these and return\"". And lastly\, the lip-syncing is not brilliant in the non- pre-rendered cutscenes. This can be slightly jarring too\, but in reality I really am nit-picking.There is of course a sadness that we might not get to meet Cid or Vincent\, or go to rocket town\, or fight emerald weapon. Knowing we might not get these opportunities until 2030. However\, I am just thankful that they executed this so well\, with a huge amount of respect to the original.… Expand"

Models are renderedA beautiful recreation of Midgar with welcome expansion of some key characters from the original and a solid combat system\, held back by some design/ technical issues and creative choices that for some original fans may be more of a meteor crater than a dent in an otherwise solid game.In depth below:Graphics:The game is absolutely visually stunning to look at. Models are rendered amazingly and the Midgar looks phenomenal - with wall market being a personal visual highlight.Unfortunately as reported\, there were frequent instances were textures appear low quality or “pop” in - certainly enough to warrant this games not being 10/10 in the graphics department which is a shame.Story:I’m not a diehard fan of ff7 so I can’t speak too much of faithfulness to the original but I think there were some excellent expansions on some of the key casts stories and motivations that I think fans will welcome and enjoy for most of their ride through FFVII: R. This is not to say it is perfect and are certainly some key creative decisions that when looked at objectively do feel rushed\, out of place\, and not fitting of the first instalment of this remake.Gameplay:Combat was a fun blend of action hack and slash with use of the ATB gauge to use items\, materia and other weapon abilities. Other party members have unique combat styles that are fun to master and it felt like a breeze to switch between characters or issue commands.My main criticism with the Combat lay with normal mode\, in which didn’t feel tougher but rather that enemies felt very padded - especially boss battle encounters to which abilities didn’t feel impactful and the stagger gauge\, a returning gameplay mechanic from FFXIII\, seemed incredibly slow to fill for little payback. Even the summons\, which can be called upon during specific fights and fight alongside the party for a short spell\, didn’t feel like they made as much of an impact. On easy mode it does seem to remove the extra padding making combat feel a little more satisfying.The side quests are pretty cookie cutter “NPCs first fetch quest“\, but there are some fun mini games thrown in to mix things up. Music:I absolutely loved the soundtrack of this game. They made some original tracks feel part of the world with modern takes on the older melodies and it felt like the score had plenty of range while hitting the nostalgia notes when it needed to.In conclusion:All in all a great game that has had a loving amount of detail poured into the world befitting of the long development cycle. Creative choices from a story standpoint have the biggest impact on the score and I can see OG fans rating this much much lower as a result. But for me\, the love and care gone into everything else that has gone into this game means it can salvage a much higher result.7/10 - thanks for coming to my ted talk.… Expand"
74299,FFVIIR,2020-04-17,4,"First of all\, I've finished the game\, so I'm going to talk about the entire content and not just the demo. (No spoilers though).Indeed\, the demo was really in the spirit of the original is this and that explains most of the sales. But how many people actually played the game with it?Indeed the game is quite beautiful\, even very beautiful at times. However\, there is a huge problem with the physics of the engine. A lot of objects on the ground are moved when you crash into them. I can understand this when you crash into a small plastic stud\, but a 200 kg steel beam? this is quite ridiculous. Then\, the majority of dialogue scenes in the form of cinematic are plan-plane\, no real gestures\, in short\, this is the level of animation of the years 2010... in the end\, it hasn't evolved since FFX. Most of the dialogues are very badly written\, unlikely. Since The last of Us I haven't seen another game being able to tell me \""it's credible!\""\, the only interaction I found credible was Cloud and Jessie\, the rest was forced\, badly played or pure filling. A lot of filling for not much in this remake. Moreover the game is enormously sanitized\, never the slightest drop of blood or evidence of physical violence makes the whole thing very unbelievable...As for the main story of the FF7 Midgar game\, it's basically correct but nothing more (the ending is just absolutely rubbish). For the rest\, I'll go to the Spoiler zone.Otherwise\, the music is either nice (well\, only in the playable part of the demo\, which takes the theme of the game) and then\, in everything else\, or it's massacres of the original themes (the TURKs theme for example\, what a horror). Either from the insipid nightclub sound... but hey\, since de Nobuo Uematsu doesn't deal with FF musics anymore\, they are only interchangeable background musics and not musics designed to express an emotion or an atmosphere.Then\, the fighting system... I didn't know that the future of jrpg was dark drunk and even slower and more boring... it goes at the beginning\, but becomes very quickly heavy\, repetitive and slow. Maybe the solution found to increase the playing time .Anyway\, my ideas are in a mess\, but clearly\, this game doesn't deserve the notes (probably made only on the demo) of the game. It's a game that relies only on nostalgia to ensure its sales\, but taken as a standalone on a new license would have been an average PS4 game and not a \""best-seller\"".POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERTBut for me this game is to FF7 what Star Wars 7 and Star Wars 4 are to FF7\, that is to say an identical narrative\, but without impact because it's very badly brought. For example\, Sephiroth is shown as the big bad guy at the end in a completely stupid fight just to make fan service advent children. There is absolutely nothing that says Sephiroth is the bad guy before the last 10 minutes. Moreover\, the previous comparison remains valid\, I felt like I was playing a design game by Disney. No one dies\, no more stakes\, everyone comes back to life.And as for the ghosts\, which is a deus ex machina bad\, but so bad... Those ghosts are only there for people who finished the game in 1997 saying\, well\, you wanted the game from then? well\, we don't want to do it again. I see the ghosts as being the players wanting to force the story to be the same as it was back then\, and the developers saying to force fate and tell people who want to play a remake **** you\, we're changing the story\"". In that case\, don't do a remake\, release FF16... But hey\, considering the quality of 15 and 13-213-213-3\, Square clearly has no more aura. This is the last Final Fantasy I buy. In my mind the license is definitely dead.… Expand"

Cela change non seulement la partie Midgard mais aussi toute la suite de l'aventure à venir (et pas que des **** changements)\, a tel point que ça dénature complètement l'histoire originale. Ok mais imaginons que cet épisode était appelé reboot et non remake\, est ce que ça passerait mieux ?Et bien non\, les choix scénaristiques n'ont aucun sens\, dignes d'une fanfiction d'un gamin de 12 ans. On vient incorporer à l'univers de FF7 des histoires de destin\, de timelines\, d'univers parallèle et en prime\, on vient même cracher au visage des puristes explicitement dans la représentation d'un des derniers combats. Je ne vais pas m'étendre sur le côté DBZ de la mise en scène à certains moments\, si vous avez vu Advent Children\, sachez que c'est maintenant introduit dans le jeu. Voilà pour mon avis sur le scénar\, dans un soucis d'objectivité\, je dois tout de même préciser que l'ajout du pan de scénario sur Jesse est plutôt bon sans pour autant être extraordinaire ni imposant.Pour ce qui est de l'aspect visuel\, c'est en dent de scie : tantôt magnifique tantôt honteux pour cette gen\, surtout pour un jeu couloir ...L'ost est pour moi l'un des meilleurs atouts de ce jeu\, elle est sublime.La durée de vie est dans la norme\, première run en 35h pour faire toute l'histoire et toutes les quêtes en normal. J'ai platiné le jeu en 80h.La progression dans l'histoire est juste désastreuse\, lente et d'une autre époque. On vous coupe sans arrêt par des cut scenes (dont la grande majorité est d'une inutilité sans nom)\, on vous ralenti constamment par des mécanismes inintéressants (innombrables leviers et mécanismes long à actionner\, passages étroits qui nous font avancer doucement à répétition :malade:). J'ajoute également le manque de liberté dû à un aspect trop couloir\, sans grande surprise : mécanismes - couloir - Arène combat - couloir - mécanismes - combat - cinématique et ainsi de suite. Ça coupe presque l'envie de faire une deuxième partie. Les nouveaux pans de scénario sont presque tous inintéressants\, et très mal introduits. On sent bien qu'on à voulu agrandir maladroitement la durée de vie.Le doublage FR et la VA sont bons. Mais dans les deux cas\, Aerith est juste insupportable. J'ajoute également qu'on perd en crédibilité dans les combats quand on entend dire \""C'est mon tour !\""\, \""Laisse moi tranquille\, vas t'en\"" ... un peu niais.Pour finir sur une note positive\, le gameplay est quasi parfait. Il mélange de manière ingénieuse le tour par tour à l'action avec une composante stratégique intéressante\, surtout en mode difficile. Ce système devrait être repris (et adapté) pour les futurs opus de la série à mon sens. Dynamique et nerveux\, il est pour moi l'argument n°1 du jeu.Je n'ai maintenant aucune attente pour la suite\, si ce n'est pour le gameplay. Ça sera en occasion dans tous les cas\, et je vous le conseille déjà pour ce premier opus.Merci de m'avoir lu :)… Expand"

74399,FFVIIR,2020-05-02,4,"For the newcomers\, I can see the game being mind-boggling and beautiful enough to warrant a high score. However\, for the fans of the original\, this entry falls short of the 1997 original.Straight off the bat\, I knew that it wasn't going to be the whole game. However\, what I didn't know\, was how disappointing exploring Midgar would be. Some of the side quests boil down to: Find 3 chocobos that you have to traverse the entire world map for in chapter 14. The world map itself is essentially a long straight linear line with some offshoots to dungeons making it a series of Y-shaped corridors. The quality of the side quests simply doesn't justify the game being Midgar only. Sequences in the original game have been stretched to 30 minutes so you spend more time with your favorite characters that have been brought to life\, instead of actually having something meaningful develop plotwise.Once the nostalgia wears off and you replay it\, all of these little moments that were good on the first go\, fall short and you just want to get it over with as soon as possible so you can go find that missing item/quest.Then there is the ending. This is an ending that is so disconnected with the tone of the rest of the remake and the original that I can't even begin to describe the drop in the enjoyment you get going from chapters 17 to 18. This ending fills older fans with worry and confuses newer players. SE either put this in just to get older fans talking (and will loop back to the events of the original just so they can \""surprise\"" the older fans) or they have just majorly changed it for whatever reason. Either way\, it's a shocking drop in storywriting and enjoyment compared to the rest of the game. Not only does the story become strange here. The characters they have lovingly built up in the first 35 hours completely change personalities. Aerith becomes a cryptic nonsense spewing prophet and the other characters just accept it and walk into the portal that pops up for the final boss just like that. Suddenly\, even though this doesn't fit how shes portrayed in the rest of the game at all\, Tifa says she's willing to defy destiny. Cloud doesn't say anything. Barrett\, despite just being saved by fate\, also agrees to spit in its face. Whether the change itself was good or not\, I  just cannot believe how badly they messed up the execution.I don't see how they will build up anything for part 2 anymore. The sephiroth and Aerith in this game are beings who can open dimensional portals like gods at this point of the story already. Our main cast of characters have already fought a literal manifestation of fate. Imagine going from that to the Midgar Zolom in game 2...Once I reached this ending and replayed the game on chapter select\, because of how much of a bad taste the ending left in my mouth\, all of the other issues with the games snail-like pacing in some areas become noticeable and I realized that this game was not justified in being Midgar only. I am now also fearful of how many sections they will release it in and how expanding it and adding filler willl lessen the impact of the special moments in the original.… Expand"

I haven’t played the original\, and I haven’t played any FF game at all\, so maybe it’s all bit too much but my main gripes would still be the same I guess.1) The main character is an arrogant\, humourless\, grumpy idiot with a face of a 16 year old and the hairdo that makes him look very vain and silly. Surprisingly enough\, all the girls in the game swoon over him and I can only assume that the initial concept was to target socially awkward\, humourless\, bored teenage boys (I guess back in the 90s\, gamers were stereotyped like that) and lure them in with the assurance that hot girls found that kind of **** attitude completely irresistible. Boy\, are they in for a surprise.2) The story doesn’t make any sense at all\, not even in small segments\, which results in incredibly dull and pointless dialogue.  The story starts with the good guys blowing up a reactor and because their bomb was a bit too powerful\, they destroy half of the city\, killing a lot of innocents in the process. Is that supposed to make you root for these guys? Didn’t work with me. Because of the terrorist attack\, there is heightened security alert and our heroes try to act unsuspicious when they board the train. Well\, one of them has a heavy machine gun for a right hand\, one of them a man sized sword on his back and the third looks like a teenage hooker with a boob job\, and still they pass security without anyone so much as glancing at them. Then the game throws in more bad guys\, mystical creatures\, robots\, gods\, ghosts\, as they see fit\, with no regard for storytelling\, just to have a constant flow of boss fights.3) Controls are the clumsiest I’ve experienced in a long while. When you meet the flower girl for the second time\, there is a 5 minute walk over the rooftops and in any other game like Tomb Raider or Uncharted\, this would be a fun jump\, run\, climb\, swing\, shimmy parkour with lot’s of action\, but here\, since you can do nothing but walk\, I mean\, no jumping\, no ducking\, nob climbing\, you just move from prompt to prompt and let the game do the work for you\, which is so boring\, that I wondered why they put it in there in the first place. While we’re at it\, this Cloud fellow\, in battle he can jump over 30 feet gaps and practically fly quite easily\, but when they make their way through the slummy environment it’s apparently impossible to climb over a car wreck\, or jump over a three feet gap. It just feels so wrong most of the time.4) Pointless side missions. There is one side mission that is quite ironically called ‘the Party never stops’ where you run around like a headless chicken for 20 minutes and it culminates in having to find sick people in toilets. If this is supposed to be funny\, I just don’t get the humour. Also\, whenever they have a go at anything non combat (the term puzzle would just not be inappropriate I think) it feels really stupid\, like operating the giant robot hand\, or getting the catwalks in place.Which leaves the combat. Well I guess this is very thought through and complex and I’m just a bit too impatient to learn all the elements and angles. I will try to get more into that\, cause there must be one redeeming quality\, right?… Expand"
74436,FFVIIR,2020-04-20,3,"I feel like rose-tinted-glasses are the only reason this remake was a success.As you play through the beginning from the first reactor to the slums and Seventh Heaven this game seems great\, it seems like it stuck with the original game and it keeps the same tone\, atmosphere\, and story. As an individual that grew up playing the original FFVII\, I was in love\, it was beautiful to see these scenes recreated\, and the beginning filler quests were things like pest controls or finding cats\, some obvious filler\, but hey\, it's the beginning of the game and Cloud's trying to get his name out as a merc\, so it was passable and made sense he was stuck doing small-fry work.It only went downhill from there\, the filler became more tedious\, and my god is there filler\, it's a chore by the halfway point\, the only thing that drives you onward is the fact that the scenes that stayed true to the original are amazingly done\, the music\, voice acting\, emotion and love put into it is felt through. Yet an even amount of iconic scenes are ruined by the addition of the Dementors\, which not only ruin old beloved scenes\, but also their meta-narrative will rip you out of the story once you figure out their purpose.The characters are amazingly well done\, they sound exactly like I always imagined\, their personalities fit the original game so well\, doing away with the one-dimensional husks the compilation made them. Definitely the best part of the remake.The use of Sephiroth is atrocious and just ruins his character and the mystery behind him\, killing what tension the original had.The last step that made me simply want the game to end so I could stop being disappointed was the Shin-Ra HQ\, there was so much linear pointless corridor filler I thought I was back in FFXIII. At one point I forgot I was in the HQ because I was desperately trudging through trying to make it end. This is the same place where you meet Red XIII\, a main character than is no longer playable\, and the excuse given was his character wouldn't be developed enough to justify him being playable(?) even though he fights side by side with you for pretty much every fight\, because screw you Red XIII fans\, you should've been Cloud or Tifa fans instead.After that the iconic \""trail of blood\"" scene is butchered because the developer is now afraid of blood so you follow purple goo in an otherwise spotless HQ\, which is the least intimidating thing I've ever experienced. Then you get a pretty awesome Rufus fight\, which was the only good thing about the HQ besides taking the stairs.Then the ending simply becomes Kingdom Hearts and completely changes the story so it's officially no longer the original FF7\, Cloud and co. transcend realities and fight Dementors and Sephiroth while Advent Children anime fight scenes happen\, Cloud almost defeats Sephiroth right there\, which further makes remake-Sephiroth a joke and no threat whatsoever.This is not a remake of the original FF7 like it was advertised\, they said there would be story changes\, but given the name \""remake\"" I feel like many (including myself) assumed it would just be changes of things like the addition of Roche\, or characters like Leslie Kyle and Kyrie getting some side-arcs\, things that weren't in the original but could still reasonably exist alongside the original story we expected\, added content that has some level of quality that wasn't in the original\, to give more life and playtime to Midgar.Not that this would actually be a literal spinoff that isn't even close to the original FF7 and should be considered an entry in the compilation. We asked for a remake or remaster for years\, and they said that's what we were getting\, so it's not unreasonable to think people would expect a FF7 remake\, not a spin-off under the guise of a remake. While technically the name makes sense\, being a remake of the original storyline\, and how they're \""remaking\"" destiny. SE could have said they were completely changing the entire plot\, but they chose not to\, they chose to mislead customers.

74461,FFVIIR,2020-04-12,7,"I'll try to be as short as possible on this one.I first played this game on my dad's PS1 when I was like 6 or so. Didn't really understand anything at all\, since I'm not a native English speaker. I never really thought much of it. That changed when I replayed it when i was 17 or so. I suddenly realized what it was about\, went through the hardships with the characters and was sunk into the story and the universe of FF7.Just to clarify\, I played through the entire FF7R with all side quests in about 38 hours\, experienced all the content there probably is.So let's break down the review into a few categories.Visuals: My god\, the game is absolutely stunning. Though there are some texture loading issues and the background of the slums while on the underplate of plate 5 is just a pixelated 2d texture\, I enjoyed looking at the game every time. Random NPCs look like **** but that doesn't matter since the main cast is just breathtaking. Aerith especially looks incredibly beautiful... 9/10Audio: Phenomenal voice acting\, great sound effects\, INSANE soundtrack... would give 11/10 if I could.Combat: With the history that Square has of not being able to do a good combat system\, I went in prepared for a rough ride. That wasn't the case at all. The core of the combat is great! Every character is unique and feels fun to play\, maybe except Barret\, but that's a nitpick. I loved playing as Tifa the most\, her comb-ish playstyle fits great with what I like. There are many tactical elements too\,. The difficulty again was extremely surprising. Most Square games are easy peasy\, but this was very well balanced a thought out. Aerith is broken though... 9/10Progression: Materia system is great\, works pretty much the same as in the original. The weapon Materia core upgrades are interesting\, well though out\, but not that interesting as you progress further. They contain only raw stats\, with the exception of that healing passive on kill. The proficiency system with weapon skills is an amazing idea. I truly loved it. Leveling feels a little bit unimpactful and Materia stat changed are very very small... 8/10Basic Enemy design: Here is the Achilles heel of the combat system. Many enemies you fight are WAY too tanky\, have frustrating mechanics like 1 minute long immunity\, AoE hex\, AoE paralyze\, AoE sleep\, etc. and your companions aren't exactly very good at dodging those. The thing I hated the most though was the fact that the enemies pretty much always target only the character you are actively controlling. That is lazy as **** and makes the game forcing you to play Barret in hard fights... 3/10Boss design: On the contrary\, Boss fights are AWESOME in this game. Every boss feels unique\, has cool mechanics\, many stages\, environment play a great role in many of the fights and the are so MANY of them. Rufus was in my opinion the best fight. Very entertaining. Many bosses have INSANE health bars though\, and whacking them for too long makes it tedious and not very fun... 9/10Level design and exploration: Another thing Square REALLY struggles at\, but this time they weren't able to turn it around. Most of the game are one-way corridors with an occasional chest or secret Materia. Exploration is at it's best while simply looking at the distance and observing the beautiful scenery of Midgar... 5/10Story: ... So... if this was an original game\, I would say it was good. Like 7/10. But this is FF7 \""remake\"". Not really a remake mind you. The first half of the game follows the original pretty well. Doesn't do a lot of new things\, only expands on an already existing lore. But after chapter 12\, everything starts to break down. If I could\, I would personally strangle the person who thought \""arbiters of fate\"" were a good idea (this is very probably Nomura's lazy ass wanting to somehow justify completely changing the story). These things singlehandedly make the game's story unimpactful. You feel like everything happens because that's what the Planet wants\, and that's a load of bull****. The pacing is all over the place. Sephiroth appears way too frequently. There is no sense of urgency. the moment Barret got stabbed and he just stood up because the Planet didn't want him do die... WHY THE **** EVEN PUT THAT IN?! jesus... At this stage of the game\, the party aren't supposed to be world boss battling OPs\, they're relatively new to this. WTF even was that final boss? Why the **** did we battle the fate itself?... 3/10Oh don't worry I know why. Because NOMURA has complexes from being just a concept artist back at OG FF7\, so nobody cared about his input and now he wants to change the entire game how he sees fit. This dude should have never been promoted. If Kitase would have 100% control over this game\, I bet it would be different.Minigames: Awesome. Drakengard 3 combined with Miku dance... I never knew I wanted that\, but I loved it... 10/10… Expand"
74504,FFVIIR,2020-04-30,4,"If i was to give a one sentence review of this game it would be \""A classic case of a epic story ruined by needless padding\"".I have played the original numerous times over the years including recently so i am not looking back with rose tinted glasses when i say the original was one of the most epic and moving games ever created with overall brilliant gameplay.The story telling was outstanding and well ahead of it's time\, I felt attached to all the main playable characters and even on repeated replays i still feel sad when Aeris (or Aerith) dies. I hated Shinra\, even more so because i felt it was terrible what they did dropping the plate on the slums and overall the world felt epic and well designed with every part having it's place.I had some trepidation starting the game as i was not impressed with FFXV combat in particular and the story was weak but after playing the first mission i was very impressed with what they had done with game including the combat which seemed like they had kept the best bits of the original combat style while modernising it in just the right way.It then slowly started to fall apart...You soon start to realise that 'expanding on the original story to flesh out Midgar' really means just add a load of increasingly repetitive\, boring and incoherent fluff to a great story which only serves to ruin it.The playable area itself is actually quite small with you repeatedly sent back to the same area which is particularly noticeable with the final batch of side quests which entail revisiting every single zone you have already been to\, sometimes for the third or fourth time.Most of the areas you traverse seem artificially stretched to elongate the game and justify releasing this small part of the story as a 'full game'. There were a number of sections in the latter half of the game in particular where i had to take a break as i was frankly bored of snaking around the most elongated route possible and return to the game later once my brain had stopped dribbling out of my ears.For the story it would seem the developers have taken the 'alternate timeline' route that is now standard for milking a franchise.If done properly this can be done well but this has not been done well because the new bits seem little more than pointless\, boring\, badly written filler. Where the remake sticks to the original story and expands on it properly it is generally great but almost every time it diverts from the original story the writing\, the voice acting and even the context seem out of place.Who is Roche? Apart from being some annoying idiot on a motorbike? He is introduced like he is going to be an ongoing rival who will challenge you throughout the game as you become stronger and then is never to be seen again...What the hell is that totally out of character dance thing with Cloud? Cloud is portrayed as the strong\, macho brooding type who has a good heart but gets very defensive and clams up whenever it comes to opening up yet stick him in a gay club and he turns into a queen. (i know cloud went drag in the original but at least true in line with his character he protested).They try to reimagine the shock of Aerith dying but having Barrett killed instead and it manages to be possibly the most lame and unemotional incident of the whole game as you just know he isn't dead.Overall\, even knowing the story i felt nothing throughout the game apart from disappointment. I didn't care about any of the characters\, that the slums had been destroyed or when Jessy or Biggs died.I didn't find myself hating Shinra or find any of the bad guys particularly sinister.Overall the main story points 'just happened'.It is obvious that they want to open the story up so they can do as they please with it and this is why i won't be buying the follow-ups as whenever they drift from the original story it is just poor.Combat started out good but there are major flaws. I found Cloud the most boring character in combat\, made worst by the fact that the right stick is both the camera and the target change so you constantly change target while just trying to see what is going on (that is when you can actually target the thing you want to target) which makes melee particularly annoying but even comparing melee characters Tifa was much more interesting to play.A good chunk of the materia seem situational at best particularly as status elements were used sparsely by enemies.Summons are only available when the devs feel you should have them where this restriction on their use ironically makes them feel less epic as they feel contrived.Classic mode is an insult but honestly i reverted to it in the end as my time was being wasted enough and i just wanted to see it through\, but i still i gave up after the after Barrett 'dying' as i couldn't take it anymore.If you want to know this epic story\, play the updated original game with the 'cheats' that eliminate the 'boring' bits… Expand"

The original FF7 contains a fantastic story\, immersive atmosphere and brought an addictive gameplay to the genre.The remake is a big bowl of crap. Do not believe the fan boy-hype.The good-The battle-gameplay with a mix of turned based action and classic ‘hack and slash’ works quite well and is fairly entertaining yet a bit repetitive.-The lightning effects\, especially in the battles\, looks and feels great.-The music stays true to the original\, meaning one of the best soundtracks out there.The bad (the oh so bad..)-They managed to f-up the original and excellent story with extremely non-logical quests and plot\, even for a J-PRG where you will go from laughs to irritation after a chapter or two.-The voice acting is not bad itself\, but the dialogue/script is just gibberish and mostly made of \""reactionary sounds\"" (ehum! ehm?! ah! huh?!). At least in the original you could visualize the character mentally\, but in this game basically all characters sound and acts mentally challenged.-The story or quest \""puzzles\"" (push the lever\, find the keycard that's right in front of you\, go to the place marked X on the map) is made for kids. Combine this with the 3-year old dialogue (probably written by Uwe Boll) and this game would fit kindergarten-game-night quite well.-Normal difficulty setting (which is the only one available starting the game\, either that or easy) is a breeze. Just use your abilites and that's it.-The animations are ok\, but the characters facial expressions are either dead or hilarious.-Camera movement have not changed really since 1997.-The game studio says that they are releasing additional episodes due to the massive map and world. The actual playable area in each chapter and scene is however very small. Sure\, there is a ton of details and back-drops..that you never get to interact with. This is a linear game no doubt about it.-The movement of characters\, especially when going under or sliding through something is annoying and bulky.If this game would have been released as a stand-alone game without any reference to the old game it would have been shame whipped all the way to the summer PSN Store Sales.Do not endorse this kind of games\, being release 2020 after seeing massive AAA-titles. Go play the original instead and spend your money on something else.On a lost note; Metacritic needs to do something about the \""either 0 or 10\""-grading.(I’m also sorry Uwe\, your movies are bad but not FF7 remake-bad).… Expand"

So let's break that down.Everyone knows that its only the midgaurd section that is included\, and the actions that do follow the path of the original\, I.e. the opening and main plot to destroy the reactors\, is an amazing nostalgia trip of the original\, and a visual treat\, save for some of the most noticable texture streaming pop up in recent times. However it's what happens between these sections that let's the game down so badly.Once you're given the freedom to run around midguard\, the problems become evident quickly: busy work. There are lots of side missions\, but they all involve the same basic mechanics and reuse the same locations over and over. These locations\, thought often stunning\, suffer from poor texture optimisation and steaming outdoors\, and long empty corridor sections inside to hide each hub area loading in the background.The new story additions too are very our of place\, and in particular the motorcycle sections and boss there seems very at odds with the rest of the grotty setting\, complete with controls so bad that it leaves the impression that your playing a 90's arcade game. The graphics too outside of the main story\, especially these sections\, are often poor - one mission to a residential area has you walking around a completely pristine neighbourhood that would look more at home in the sims than FF\, and it utterly spoils the deep of the game. Its painfully evident where the new story elements are being written.For die hard fans of the mechanics of the original\, classic mode is offered but it's really nothing more than an AI controlled version of action mode\, which in itself is too often hidden behind a screen so busy you just mash buttons randomly and hope for the best.Summoning is also hugely disappointing\, with the ability to do it control to only boss level battles where the game decides you should be able to do it\, and choosing which character to use - if you pre-ordered prepare to see the Chocobo Chick\, the least useful of all\, on a VERY regular basis. In fact at one point the game let me summon Ifrit and I had genuinely forgotten I even had him.The realtime combat also means that confrontations are less frequent than before\, and normally feature only one or two creature types per large area\, pressumably due to memory limitations.The games transition to 3D also lends to some amazingly glaring \""linear path\"" moments....one early in during a factory missions sees you running down a path with wooden fences on each side and coming to a section which has fallen over\, but which your character refuses to cross because.....reasons.The game does look amazing\, and the main FF7 story is as compelling as ever\, and I challenge any fan of the original not to get chills during the opening section\, but the forced realtime combat\, frequent confusing and bland level design\, numbingly boring side quests and unskippable dialogue\, and poor summoning mechanics take so much away that I didnt enjoy the experience nearly as mich as the demo. In fact\, after the first 4 hours\, I'd day it's not even worth playing.And that's before we even discuss the guiding \""ghosts\"" which serve as nothing more than a mechanic to allow them to dispense with the open map sections in the next installment\, and diverge away completely from the story we all love.What should have been amazing is in reality a run of the mill action slasher riding the coat tails of legend.… Expand"

Yes\, I've played the original\, and no\, I wasn't 12 at the time\, nor was it my favorite game\, or even favorite installment in the series. I also came into the remake with zero expectations\, but cautiously optimistic and hoping to enjoy it on its own merits.The game certainly looks gorgeous - at least when all the textures actually load in\, which to be fair\, is most of the time. No complaints there. And the remixes of the old soundtrack all sound pretty fantastic (save for the jukebox versions\, which may have given me ear cancer).The entire cast\, including supporting characters have been greatly fleshed out\, and for the most part the characterizations are done pretty well. As far as voice acting goes\, in English\, Cloud really nails it\, but the rest of the cast is extremely hit & miss\, with the majority being voiced by the same bottom-barrel zero-talent troupe that has been making a laughing stock of dubbed anime and JP games for decades. While they certainly do a better job than they do with most games\, putting whipped cream on **** only does so much to make it more appetizing. I'm fairly convinced some of these people have never had a natural conversation in their lives at this point.Some new characters make their appearances as well\, and they really stand out. Not in a good way. You can really tell the difference between the old cast designs and personalities in comparison to the super ridiculous trash characters added in. They add nothing\, and only really serve to make the world less coherent and less... I would say believable\, but that's not quite the world. Best I can do though.Now gameplay\, and hooboy\, where to start. SE has never been able to make a decent action-combat system\, and it's really showing here. All the problems that combat had in XV show up here with bells on. Some actually worse.To start with\, the party A.I. is abominable. All they do is auto-attack (with a very\, very few exceptions if you give them certain materia) and they do so at a snail's pace\, meaning they build ATB for spells and abilities at roughly 1/10 the pace of the character you're controlling\, further meaning that if you actually want to use any spells or abilities on your party characters\, you are absolutely forced to constantly swap between them - and given the lackluster targeting and lock-on system the game uses\, this can quickly become disorienting when you're in a large group battle or boss battle.Also\, the AI does very little to actually avoid incoming damage\, so you constantly need to babysit them as well.Gambits\, Square-Enix. Give them to us if you're going to insist on inflicting your sub-par action combat on us. For God's sake. I'm not one of those people who whined about the game not being turn-based like the original\, but given how this turned out\, and how your past endeavors with action combat have failed so miserably\, I can very well understand their position.Dodging does fundamentally nothing\, except against the most rudimentary of foes\, and their most basic attacks\, as everything from anything more beefy - especially bosses - WILL track you until it lands. Likewise you can guard\, but this is mitigated by the fact that many enemies have grab attacks which go straight through your guard\, and have tells which are nigh indistinguishable from their other attacks\, especially amidst the rain of particle effects showering the screen at all times. Bosses just don't care if you guard or not in most cases.Status-attacks are nearly useless to use\, and when used by enemies naturally track you until they hit\, often leaving huge lingering clouds of effect that WILL give you status ailments 100% of the time unless you expressly put on something to immunize yourself before you encounter them. Usually not too dangerous\, but extremely annoying nonetheless\, especially given the near zero success rate of your own.Like Ice magic? Enjoy the fact that it doesn't damage on contact\, but rather you have to wait for an overblown animation where the ice crystal grows and then finally - seconds later - explodes where it initially impacted\, giving enemies more than ample time to just casually stroll out of the area of effect before they get hurt.Speaking of mobility in combat\, enemies have it in spades\, and you generally don't. As usually SE is grossly in love with their animations\, and you have to sit through the end of every overblown animation before you can do whatever it is you want to do next\, be it move\, cast\, attack or dodge\, meaning by the time you actually can\, generally you're out of position for it. Some enemies are so mobile that nearly every attack will whiff\, no matter how good your stats are\, because in the time between your button-press and the attack going off\, they're far\, far out of range. It's intensely frustrating.Well\, I'm at the character limit\, so there's that. Oh\, and every mini-game is absolute cancer. Enjoy.… Expand"

Finishing it completely changed my opinion of the game.Good standalone game but this isn't a remake\, it's FF7-2. I'm judging this as a remake.Where to start on this game.So I'm a huge fan of the original and with the remake I expected some differences from the original\, which is fine as long as it sticks to the story.This is what made the original so good\, the story itself but even more so the way it was told.This remake covers disc 1 of the original so covers midgar only.For the most part it stays true to the original right up to the last couple of chapters. (i really enjoyed it up until the shinra building)Lets start with the graphics:First couple of chapters\, they look amazing but as the game goes on the graphics get worse\, looks like a PS2 game in places. If I didn't know better I'd say Square put the most effort into the start of the game to hook people. After that it really is poor graphically and badly needs patching.GameplayThey have gotten rid of the turn based system and now realtime. It's isn't bad and I liked it after getting a handle on it\, but would have preferred the original. It turns the game into an action game more than an rpg imo\, which they also did with the story in a way\, but we will get to that.I don't like how Red XIII is now not a playable character\, they have dumbed down the materia system\, less summons\, less use of summons. Overall the combat is good but they have tinkered with it too much imo.StoryThis is where the they game falls on it's face unfortunately. They introduced new ghosts of destiny which I didn't like but not a game breaker. They made some changes in who survives the pillar scene\, no big deal.Where it starts to fall apart is the shinra building. They skip over a lot of tension building in the shinra section\, show way too much of Seiphorath\, introduce some time/alternate dimension nonsense with the ghosts of destiny and pretty much have you fight Seiphorath in a battle similar to the last battle of the game in the original.With part 2 of the original\, you were being built up to who/what Seiphorath was and what has happened with Cloud\, in part one of the remake they have taken elements from the final part of the original game which completely removes any of the mystery.One of the main things I noticed\, near the end in the building it was playing the seiphorath music\, like the original\, to build tension.In the original it worked as there were a lot of unknowns. In this it was out of place\, I was running around hacking and slashing like an action game\, had already seen lots of the main boss so there really was no tension at all\, just another generic boss. Some heavy guitar would have been more appropriate.Overall this is a decent stand alone game but this isn't a remake\, and I'm judging it as a remake.They could probably wrap the whole game up in one more part now as they have chucked so much of the game into the final chapters and just made a load of stuff up which wasn't in the original.I was eagerly awaiting this game for years\, now it's out and the follow up will come in a couple of years\, it's very meh.Fans wanted a remake\, not a rewritten story with ghosts and alternative dimensions\, frankly. If they hadn't screwed up the ending so badly this would have been a solid 8/10.Wouldn't surprise me if you told me Kojima directed this\, convoluted nonsense. Again I was open to changes\, but the changes are childish and nonsensical at the end which don't make me worry about the next chapter\, but make me have written it off already.If you are a fan of the original\, AVOID.… Expand"

Each area (Slums from sector 7\, Wall Market\, etc.) has its own presentation like an introduction of a book\, with an specific NPC to make connections for you to do sidequests. Like I said my only gripe is with the size and by the way the said this was a midgar focused game I thought we would see more of this living city\, I know we got a lot of content but It feels like it’s a bit small and not a lot to explore. “Quick Jobs for your everyday Merc” As i said previously there are some Sidequests in the game that I personally consider fun because they’re not long stretched and the fact that you can completely ignore them without missing important or crucial items makes them very balanced for the game. I honestly wished there was more to it or different ones that you would actually need to go to the upper plates and such.For same these side quest might not be the funniest of any game\, since most of the times are a run through an area with monsters to get an item for an npc but overall i think they could be a lot more improved in an obvious part 2 of the game. “Mini games remakes”The question of some people\, that actually care about these little details\, the mini games are actually pretty fun\, I actually played them with a couple of different people and everyone enjoyed each one. The squats and even a Whack a Mole are amazing\, time flies when you’re playing a game within a game! “Let the battles begin!” The combat system feels really polished\, there are some camera stuff that cannot be perfected by today’s standards but it’s really fun to play. There’s actually settings for how the camera works and you should definitely modify these setting at your desire.The materia and progression system of cores for each weapon had me really invested that I actually played it for a second time just as I finished the game\, and the fact that you can pick you weapon and carry over the special ability once you fulfill the proficiency bar of each one you feel you’ve got a lot of options at your disposal for each character and makes you understand why an specific character introduced almost at the end of the game isn’t playable\, the bar is set and I cannot wait to see what will they do for the next part of the game with the characters.“Embracing the fantasy”This is a review with minimal spoilers so the best way I can talk about the story is by saying\, it shows that they actually cared that this wasn’t just a cash grab game\, the updated story of the original game (Midgard portion) it’s amazing\, how the characters interact with each other\, your every now and then pre rendered scene\, and the comedic moments aren’t cringe my at all. And a quick note here: The way they remade every single song from the original it’s phenomenal\, once again it shows that they actually cared for the fans. An original song that originally lasted a minute and a half\, now lasts 10 minutes! It has variations depending the situation\, Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu did an outstanding job making new songs and actually giving you the feel that the old OST is now complete that this is the way it’s meant to sound.And of course it may be a divisive theme going on specially with the ending\, but I feel confident that this the way the game will be relevant (just like the 97’ game)\, it might be setting up something for the future or the devs are having fun by throwing us for a loop so the game feels like it has an ending. They took the Episodic meaning to another level\, I can only compare it to Avengers Infinity war\, you know there’s a 2nd part coming but you feel satisfied at the end of the ride. For me and for a lot of us was something special back in 1997\, some purists might not like the game at all and they have their right\, even if there is an atb system with a Classic mode (Super easy) but after all you can’t make everyone happy. This was a ride I hope we get to enjoy even more with the next game\, and I can’t even begin to imagine the things they can do with next gen hardware.

74621,FFVIIR,2020-04-20,10,"I have read a ton of these reviews and the negative ones I have noticed are dealing with not following the story exactly.STORY: I have played this game since the introduction in 97 and have always thought that they could have done more with the story\, especially with the antagonist Sephiroth\, you never see him except in flashbacks\, so for the Remake\, I am quite satisfied with them bringing him out early\, to me\, it sets the tone for the rest of the game\, knowing that Sephiroth is more of a threat from the beginning of the game\, praying on Clouds mind and emotions\, agging him on and taking advantage of his hate for him.Everything in FF7R that makes FF7 what it is\, is still there\, nothing has been lost\, all the special moments throughout the game have been flushed out and emphasized\, all the characters you got to know more\, with Berets hard outer shell and soft heart to Tifa's Deap care for others\, these are the things I wanted in the original\, but was only slightly able to get a glimpse of\, I was pleasantly surprised of how a great job the writers did on this\, they really made you care deeply for each and every character\, including Biggs\, Wedge and Jessie\, to the point that you were truly saddened when\, things happened.My point is< the writers only had so much they could work with\, story wise\, the technical limitations of the time made it impossible\, So I'm sure the way they wrote the story in the remake was what they had originally had in mind\, but could only keep the most important bits\, I am amazed that people swear by the original and say this is not a remake and give them a bad score because they diverted\, not realizing that what was in the original was only a fraction of what they wanted\, In my opinion\, this IS the true story\, everything still critical to what makes FF7 what it is\, is still there\, the big difference now\,  is they are able to extrapolate\, add and expand the story to what they originally intended.BATTLE SYSTEM: I think this is as close as you can get to a turn based battle system as you can get without actually going there\, The battle system still has all the components of a turn based system while still integrating an action based system at the same time\, you still cannot take any action unless you have ATB to sped INCLUDING items\, the only thing not affected by the ATB is the action part\, primarily used to build ATB (swinging Clouds sword or Tifa's punches) This is what makes this battle system a hybrid action turn based\, and it's brilliant\, you really have to plan every action\, your ATB 's can also be interrupted and you could lose all your progress\, so your positioning on the battlefield is also critical\, and just as important is to keep yourself healed up\, enemies can take multiple actions at once. it is also important it switch characters frequently\, a lot of the enemies will focus on the controlled characters\, switching  frequently forces the enemy to change targets (not all the time\, but most of the time) I love this combat system.SIDE QUESTS: Not really much to say about this\, they did an excellent job on them\, and the fact that there weren't side quests in every chapter was great\, none of the side quest where boring or tedious\, and they all told a story at the same time flushing out the characters\, I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to do an entire chapter with Biggs Wedge and Jessie\, something to which I thought was a shame we never got to know them in the original\, Just Berrets sidekicks and that's all. The best side quest though was with chadly\, vary challenging boss battles to obtain powerful summons and other matiria as a result of your actions throughout the game\, most of the objectives completed themselves and the game kept track of them even if you never obtained the quest yet\, making this the best side quest in the game\, and all the mini games had great rewards as well\, making it well worth the challenge.In my opinion\, this has been the best game of the year and I cannot wait to see the next game.… Expand"

74665,FFVIIR,2020-04-15,5,"With how often promotional material for Final Fantasy VII Remake advertised a \""faithful\"" remake\, after completing this game\, you'd question how these people would function in a romantic relationship. Perhaps to them\, being faithful is only cheating on their partner once a week. Let that metaphor sink in for the following review: This Is Not Final Fantasy VII Anymore.Here is a list of 'absolute' story changes this \""Remake\"" deploys on its player base:1) Wedge and Biggs survive the fall of the Sector 7 plate\, removing Barret's raison d'être for his fueled hatred against Shinra. So much emotional weight was put into these connections for it to be satisfyingly sad when they perish. Except permanent death is not a thing nowadays. It is now a sin to have an audience experience negative emotions that capture the tapestry of life.2) Sephiroth is not an unknown presence to be feared and learned about. He is immediately recognized as a threat to every single person who witnesses him--and everyone witnesses him because he appears multiple times throughout the game\, including as the final boss. This final encounter copies the cinematography and choreography of Cloud's battle at the end of FF7: Advent Children. Sephiroth envelops Midgar in shadow; Cloud and him face-off 1v1; Sephiroth tells Cloud he'll exist forever after being defeated. Previous ideas are recycled to pad nostalgia further in this climax.3) The overall story now closely resembles Kingdom Hearts. The epicenter of divergence from the original story happens in a place called \""Destiny's Crossroads\"" (like Destiny Island from Kingdom Hearts). Here\, you'll encounter a massive fiend the same shape as a Darkside Heartless. This fiend is attached to three new Time/Space entities that give visions to EXACT FOOTAGE from the END of FF7 and FF7: Advent Children (such as Meteor hitting the planet\, Red XIII and his children\, Aerith dying\, and the final battle against Sephiroth). This story now involves multiple timelines and time travel I guess.4) Speaking of timelines\, Zack appears and he's alive and well\, watching you defeat Sephiroth. It is unknown if every game after the original FF7 will become moot after this Remake is complete.5) After defeating Sephiroth\, Cloud already has a feeling that the Sephiroth wasn't real and needs to find the real one. There is little reference to Jenova in this entire game\, and the concept of \""Reunion\"" seems like common knowledge\, so it is impossible how these characters come to such a comfortable conclusion of hating Sephiroth\, believing he was a fake\, and thinking he'll destroy the planet. Aerith even goes so far as to say to Sephiroth\, \""Everything about you is wrong.\"" Remember\, Aerith has never met Sephiroth before. You'll often find this dichotomy of writing that has the characters fully aware of the game's expanded lore and then sometimes not at all.6) Sephiroth transports Cloud to a distant planet for a short duel. He wins\, but says that Cloud has 7 seconds to make a change. If you count to 7\, nothing happens by the end of it... Afterwards\, Cloud somehow returns to Midgar and his party is ready to track down and destroy Sephiroth. None of this makes sense.7) The earliest change players will encounter are called \""Whispers\"". These mysterious\, hooded ghosts appear during divergences from the original game. It quickly becomes apparent that these ghosts sometimes impede your progress to sustain the original FF7's plot\, and then sometimes intervene to change it. They ensure you can't save Jessie\, because she's supposed to die\, but they are involved in the final battle against Sephiroth that is felt by every citizen of Midgar. Also\, these Whispers are seen by Aerith immediately\, and then eventually everyone else in the gang\, including Rufus Shinra\, but not by any of the Turks for some reason. These things exist solely to be theorized about by Youtubers to prolong the exposure of FF7R.Conclusion:This game's combat and materia system is complex and beautifully designed. The music is astounding and very fitting\, except for a new arrangement of One Winged Angel that sounds flat. These components are the sole reason to play the game. New characters like Roche fit well into Midgar\, but new story scenes create a lack of urgency that get annoying. And the main plot is now the epitome of everything wrong in modern storytelling. Content is obtuse\, actions are convenient\, characters never speak their mind which lead to cliche story problems\, and the more mystery for people to talk about the better. Final Fantasy VII Remake is well-worth renting\, or buying used for ~$30. The story experience and concluding frustration and confusion is not worth full price. I will not support the future games that draw on the same tropes and rehashing of ideas that exist in parallel franchises. Depending on your taste in storytelling\, buyer integrity\, and disposable income\, you will make a choice appropriate to your life.… Expand"
74667,FFVIIR,2020-04-12,6,"I wanted to love this game\, I really did. I'm one of the old guard\, I grew up with games like Final Fantasy VII\, When square-enix announced this remake I was cautiously optimistic\, I knew what square-enix's track record with the series was like after being burned by Final Fantasy XV\, but I also knew that as long as they stuck to the source material and added some modern shine\, everythingI wanted to love this game\, I really did. I'm one of the old guard\, I grew up with games like Final Fantasy VII\, When square-enix announced this remake I was cautiously optimistic\, I knew what square-enix's track record with the series was like after being burned by Final Fantasy XV\, but I also knew that as long as they stuck to the source material and added some modern shine\, everything would be fine.It wasn't fine.The audio ranges from faithful and fantastic orchestral versions of the original audio\, to the barely memorable tracks in place of classics\, someone tell me why oppressed people is no longer the theme in wall market when it was so iconic in the original\, and tell me what they replaced it with because sitting here writing this\, I can't remember it was so forgettable.Area design\, is fantastic and faithful to the source material but marred by low quality textures\, NPC models\, sky boxes and backdrops. This is a crying shame because there are numerous standout moments like your first visit to Aerith's house that absolutely floored me\, then immediately after I walk back into the sector 5 slums and the textures are all over the place once again and the NPC's look like they fell out of a PS2 game. Exploring the world\, as in the physical movement from place to place is also a mixed bag\, animations and movement speed are fine\, but the game way over uses forced walking to the point of it being infuriating. Every dungeon has multiple areas filled with debris to crawl or squeeze through at a snails pace\, multiple zones where you walk and talk\, every time you go indoors you're forced to walk. It feels like the developers added this in just to make the game feel longer\, but it's utterly infuriating regardless. Speaking of dragging the game out\, sidequests are entirely optional\, but entirely pointless. They could have given these some minor story significance\, used them to flesh out characters or plot points\, but instead they're boring fetch or kill quests for people you don't know and care very little about.Combat for me was hugely conflicted. I'm a fan of classic turn based RPG's\, but I was 100% willing to give this game and it's new action hybrid combat the benefit of the doubt\, and I'm mostly glad I did\, with a few caveats. Firstly hit-stun is absolutely horrendous and needs toning down every single love tap from an enemy knocks you on your ass and cancels your abilities. Secondly the camera is awful\, and finally switching from offence to defence is too slow due to animation locking\, which exacerbates the hit-stun problem. Otherwise\, combat is fun\, an awesome mix between tactical and action combat and a standout feature of the game. Animations are fantastic and the boss battles are a stand-out feature you're unlikely to forget should you pick this up.The plot. Ok here's my biggest issue\, everything taken from the original game\, the characters and their portrayals\, the various scenes\, most of the script\, the additional exposition\, the extended dungeons\, all that stuff\, is fantastic and I believe it really is the best portrayal of these characters we've seen so far. However\, all the bits they added on top of this\, \""feel like some kingdom hearts BS\"" as IGN recently stated in their review. There's no good way to explain this without spoilers suffice to say that plot elements have been added\, especially within the ending\, that mean that square-enix can now diverge from the original game's plot. It's poorly written\, puts this game firmly within re-imagining or reboot territory rather than being the remake we were sold\, and feels like a get-out-of-jail-free card for when they inevitably decide they've bitten off more than they can chew remaking this entire game. This is the primary reason for the average score\, you can't sell your game as a remake then sneak in a reboot during the closing scene\, it left a bitter taste in my mouth after an otherwise satisfying journey.… Expand"
74678,FFVIIR,2020-04-29,10,I played it not having played the ps1 original and I loved the hell out of this game. I picked it up (curbside) from BestBuy and raced home to play it. It literally was not turned off until I put 55hrs in and beat it.
74699,FFVIIR,2020-04-21,6,"32-year old FF7 Veteran here\, reporting. *WARNING\, SPOILERS*Just to provide a little context\, I’ve been an all-round gamer (PC\, Console\, multiple genres) for as long as I can hold a controller and I’ve played FF7 extensively. So here goes. Straight out of the gate I’d like to say that I’ve enjoyed parts of this game\, but my overall judgment of it is negative. I’ll try to keep it brief.Gameplay(Battles):By far the best aspect of this game for me. The battles are the best and most enjoyable I’ve come across in any RPG that utilises an ATB-type system. It was fun\, intelligent and engaging. It mattered what I did tactically\, and the fights were not easy\, like in many games nowadays. The moves that Cloud and Tifa perform are awesome. I defeated Shiva on the second try\, by settings Ice and Elemental materias on defense\, I love that the materia system has some depth like that. The original had this already\, but it’s still worth mentioning as it is also part of this game and it adequately ties into the Remake battle system as well. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the battle package. Sometimes battles could take an extreme amount of time\, when by coincidence I wouldn’t have the correct Materia equipped for the correct weakness of enemies.Pacing/Logistics:Quality over Quantity is the catch phrase here. The pacing is a bit too slow for my taste. There is a lot of filler content in the form of side missions that are slightly reminiscent of crisis core missions. The quality battle system soothes the filler content\, but doesn’t completely negate the effect. I regret saying that the filler content also seeps over into more important cutscenes a bit. I do believe having characters go through more ordeals together generates more bonding with and between the characters but only when the ordeals are meaningful and personal to the characters\, such as the shenanigans with Don Corneo\, the Sector 7 pillar\, etc. I like the fact that you can just take the “chocobo-bus” for free and fast travelling later on\, as soon as that form of travel becomes relevant. I’ll say it once more; Quality over quantity folks. Compared to the Witcher\, the side quests are just bland.Graphics:Not bad\, the main character models are nicely done\, although I do wish some characters had a less perfect face to give them a bit more character. Tifa looks like a sex doll to me. Regular NPC’s are complete garbage\, and their generic out-of-place (always happy\, though they live in a slum) voice acting doesn’t help with that. Bad textures for everything except the main characters pretty much. So surfaces\, walls and objects are mostly blurry. When you have something like God of War out in 2018\, there’s just no excuse for this. The magic and ability effects are best-in-class as you can expect form SE. Summon models are also well done. The first time I looked up at the plate from the slums was a breath-taking moment. In summary: Also a mixed bag\, and could’ve been much better.Story/Presentation/Voice acting:Generally\, zooming in on a story arc works well if you’re trying to give it more depth. SE has succeeded somewhat in this regard\, when it comes to memorable characters like for example Jessie and Aerith. Especially such a scene as where you go to Jessie’s house can make the gravity of the events that unfold more relatable and grounded in reality. Really though\, if you have not played FF7 before you play this game\, you will have a question mark above your head throughout the whole game. Hell\, I even had a question mark a good amount of times\, and there’s very little info on the new plot-line untill pretty much the end. Fighting the ultimate bad guy while in the OG you only just found out who he is\, feels wrong. In the context of this game\, which completely changes the story arc it might turn out not to be strange later on. And here is the segway into the most controversial problem with this game. It just destroys and nullifies story arcs like JJ Abrams did in the latest Star Wars film. Although I am curious to see where they go from here. This new direction neither respects nor adds to the original. Not a good choice overall\, and not the choice people were hoping to see either.When it comes to voice acting and animation I strongly believe they should’ve gone with motion capture and corresponding voices\, at least for the important scenes. This would’ve given so much more life to the characters and story. Especially Aertih’s voice is bland\, typecast and generic. The script is also a mixed bag. Barret’s voice acting is good\, but also easy as he’s always over the top and angry. But you can feel that the scenes aren’t acted together like they are with mocap\, and although they did a reasonable job with the animation it just doesn’t hit the mark anno 2020. The animation system in the Witcher 3 is better\, and so is the voice acting. Red XIII’s voice deserves an honorable mention.… Expand"

Bonita historia y gran combate a tiempo real a partes iguales.Aspectos positivos:- El sistema de combate\, desde mi punto de vista\, es intachable. Me parece \""simple\"" pero a la vez con muchas posibilidades\, y cuanto más se avanza en el juego más versátil se vuelve. Digo simple en cuanto a que no necesitas estrujarte la cabeza para sacarle mucho partido.- La banda sonora acompaña en todo instante y lo hace increíblemente bien desde los momentos más pausados a los más frenéticos. Aunque he de decir que conmigo lo tenían fácil porque me gusta mucho la música de orquesta.- La historia es bonita. No es la mayor ida de olla que se puede ver\, pero la trama entretiene a los que no hemos jugado al original lo cual me parece digno de señalar puesto que según he leído esta parte solo ocupa el equivalente al principio del título del que proviene. Quiero decir\, aguanta el ritmo durante las casi 40 horas que dura la historia principal.- Los personajes principales tienen mucho carisma. Según avanza la trama les coges más y más cariño.- Los gráficos son increíbles\, y las animaciones de combate no tienen nada que envidiar a nadie.- Tanto el doblaje en inglés como los subtítulos me han parecido muy buenos. Tengo la ventaja de entender inglés moderadamente bien y he podido ver las diferencias entre lo que decían las voces en inglés y los subtítulos en castellano. Varían algunas frases\, en la forma de hablar\, pero eso es con motivo de la adaptación\, y opino que está muy bien conseguida. Vamos\, que no he percibido ningún error de traducción\, así que las personas que se vean obligadas a entender los diálogos solo a través de los subtítulos en castellano\, pueden estar tranquilos porque es una buena traducción.- Estéticamente me parece muy bonito. Los menús son agradables de ver.Aspectos negativos (no son cosas con las que me hierva la sangre\, pero sí que quiero compartirlo):- En ocasiones el apartado gráfico deja que desear. Solo son dos o tres escenarios del juego\, pero usan un recurso para completar la estampa que no me termina de convencer. Son escenarios en los que todo está perfectamente renderizado salvo por lo que se muestra en segundo plano\, que da la impresión de ser una imagen estática y encima es muy borrosa. Hay un capítulo en el que estás en una posición elevada y si te asomas\, puedes ver la parte de ciudad que es inferior a ti; pues bien\, ese fondo es todo una imagen estática muy borrosa\, y que encima si desplazas la cámara un poco\, la imagen se distorsiona completamente y queda aún más patente que es un fondo sin animar. Entiendo que es difícil hacer un fondo entero en 3D en máquinas de hace 7 años\, pero para hacer eso yo creo que hubiese sido mejor ocultar ese fondo con una niebla o hacerlo parcialmente y hacer un fondo vivo pero más pequeño. Aunque este punto ha sido extenso\, ha sido para aclarar a qué me refería\, pero no quiere decir que me parezca un pecado. Para mí es un detalle sin mucha importancia\, pero muy cutre (he de decir que cuando lo ví\, me reí).- Las misiones secundarias se hacen pesadas. Hay algún capítulo que bajo mi punto de vista tiene demasiadas. Sus incentivos son que consigues objetos interesantes y que puedes ver un poco más de la personalidad de los personajes\, un acercamiento a ellos\, pero algunas son aburridas o te hacen ir de un lado a otro y no siempre compensa.Extra:- Si vas a por el platino\, que sepas que tienes que pasarte la historia dos veces (cosa que no me agrada ni un pelo en un juego que requiere 40 horas de media para pasártelo solo una vez).- Algunas habilidades no te dicen del todo lo que hacen y para sacarles provecho tienes que ir probándolas en diferentes situaciones. Esta es una de las veces en las que tiene su gracia que no te expliquen todo.… Expand"

Be before I simply gonna do a little message to all the haters and people who put this masterpiece a 0/10.We all have different opinions for me this game is worth 10/10 for all the reasons I will explain soon. ButBoy oh boy. There is so much to say about this game I'm gonna try to be as fast and direct as possible and avoid a massive wall of text and without saying any spoilers. Be before I simply gonna do a little message to all the haters and people who put this masterpiece a 0/10.We all have different opinions for me this game is worth 10/10 for all the reasons I will explain soon. But giving this game a 0/10  does not make sense at all. Almost all the negative comment I read was from people who did not complete the game and just hated that the mechanism was replaced. Each time one aspect of the game change and it was not to their liking they put 0/10. So if anyone reading this the negative section is not even worth reading it. It's just a bunch of salty\, angry grey whispering hatred stuff.1. Music: The music is just perfect. The amount of soundtrack in this game cannot be counted FFVII was known for their awesome soundtrack well they just took all the soundtrack perfected them. Some people said that it was trash maybe they are just deaf.2. Combat/Menu/Settings/Map: The combats are great even if people are mad that they did not put the original. I'm a huge fan of this game I liked the old combat system but it's 2020 they are trying to make this Remake for everyone\, not just people who don't want to change in their head. The menu was great I was lost at one point in the game and I find all my answers on the menu very helpful. Settings were simple to use. The map was useful.3. Characters:[Cloud]The character are so well made. Cloud on my preference level seems a bit too much like a whinny and wanna be Sasuke. Cloud was arrogant and did not care he was not whining that much in the OG but I feel they changed him to make him a bit more like. Personally\, I don't like that I would have preferred to see a more arrogant-rebel-sarcastic type. But this is personal the character ain't bad.[Tifa] was the good old Tifa I knew her voice her line her body language that's how I saw her. Again some people are put a 0/10 on this game because she got a sports bra no kidding people are pressing 0/10 easy here.[Jessie]A lot of people complain that the change was badly done some even went to the point of imagining weird twisted stuff with Jessie cuz it was not like in the original I find this a bit absurd Jessie is a good character and was not too much.[Barret]The best character made was Barret this game would be very different if Barret was not there. They keep what makes Barret he's perfect he's so funny but also his facial expression is the best when he doesn't have sunglasses weirdly enough his lines are so good.[Aerith]Perfectly done she's really funny and able to manage any kind of depressed sad grumpy person. She is so well done I'm happy they took their time.[Sephiroth] Perfectly the only thing I did not like as much was the voice acting I feel the voice actor struggle. He could have made a good Sephiroth voice but I just feel it was not made correctly rushed maybe?[The rest of the character] I honestly liked like all the other characters they really put effort into creating a personal touch to everyone.4. The story: A lot of people complain about the game was too much filler. This game is huge. They even told us that it will cover only Midgar. They could have just cover Midgar and give us a 20-25 hours game like a lot of games theses day but no. They decide to takes theirs let us discover more about the character we see and places in Midgar which was awesome the game can take 35-50 to be completed and the filler are interested why play and rate this game if you don't even love the content the rating does not make sense once again. The story was really good and the end of the game let me out of words.5. Last words: Some people are angry\, pissed because they adapted this game for something better. Final Fantasy VII was made in 1997 after the release they made other content related to it liked The Turks Story (don't know the name) which was a plain game and kind of boring only for old cellphones which almost no one knows about. They made Dirge of Cerebus which was a disaster. They made a film which was so bad I just watched it cuz I liked the FFVII universe but man it was bad. They made Crisis Core which was really good. The point is FFVII OG always had been the best think about the FFVII universe. They decide to extend it put more work and effort and passion into this work and offer something we want. I have no problem of paying money since I prefer them working and exploring the possibility of this game instead of just remaking the game exactly at it is with better graphics also the game was worth every penny of it.A lot of people missed the point of the game. Instead of giving us a part of the same game with better graphics\, they adjust it for the modern gamers and added stuff fill with passion. And they want to surprise us by continuing this epic journey.… Expand"

The characters\, the music\, the visuals (except in some parts\, like times in the day were things looked not so great)\, the story\, the jokes\, I felt genuine joy throughout the whole game.

I loved that this game was fun\, and it sounds stupid\, but last year was very boring for me. Played RE and DMC 5\, but after that everything was dull or not so great and fun\, but this was refreshing\, its a very fun and serious game\, with great and goofy moments and the gameplay packs a punch and I haven't played hard mode\, but apparently enemies change a little bit\, so that sounds fun.The story is fun\, feels like you are surrounded by a great movie cast or anime cast and it feels very 90s to me\, loved the the dynamic and the chemistry with everyone. Everyone goes through something in this game Cloud\, Barret\, TIfa\, Aerith\, Biggs\, Jessie\, Wedge\, Marlene\, Reno\, Rude\, Sephiroth\, the teacher from the orphanage\, I can keep going and its because i connected with the characters\, for some reason i was very into it. And the world building and the setups for bigger things in the future. I feel like im rambling\, but this game had me liked that for weeks\, even now\, i just wanted to talk about it.I guess its my type of game. the setting is awesome\, the armors and the swords\, but then there's cars and guns and this cyberpunk feel\, its great. If you like that and anime\, you´ll like this\, i know.Some things that I specifically enjoyed while playing: the bike sequences\, Jessie and Cloud\, just basic interactions between the main cast\, Cloud playing dress-up and dancing in the HoneyBee inn\, that's just a few.This game is not for everyone\, but i love it so much that i can recommended to anyone. it has its flaws its loading sections that irritate everyone\, weird scenes sometimes because of voice acting\, bad aerial combat\, but overall i saw this as the new era for action Final Fantasy games\, this just destroys FF15 in basically every way and as a standalone game without thinking of the original\, its a pretty solid game. Its fun\, the wait was worth it\, wanted this game since they announced it and it blew me away. I could talk forever about this game\, but that enough\, go play it if you can. The future of this franchise its exciting and I cannot wait for the sequel. This review doesn't make a lot of sense\, but I just love this game so much\, so i needed to put that out there.… Expand"

It seems there's no escaping it\, I can count on one hand the amount of \""good\"" endings I've seen come out of media of all types whether it be film\, television\, or video games.I should have known when I saw Square's recent line of work that this game would turn into a mess. Luckily\, for the most part\, it waits until the final act to do so.If you played the original Final Fantasy 7\, there's no doubt you will overlook a lot of rough stuff early on in the game. You'll stick it out because you are excited to spend time with the characters you love and the settings that you enjoyed. Over time though\, the problems will be too much to ignore even for the most loyal of fan.The good: Spending time with these iconic characters was a treat. The voice acting was top-notch. The character models were great. There were several moments where I became emotional.The okay: Combat was more than a little frustrating. While it was pretty to look at\, ultimately it became an exercise in mashing the square button. Team members do not accrue AP fast enough to be useful in battle\, requiring you to constantly switch from team member to team member. Most combat boils down to firing a spell which targets the enemy's weakness then mashing square once they are \""staggered\"". Unfortunately on bosses\, you would often stagger just as the boss entered the next phase\, thus negating your stagger. There were also other annoyances such as getting interrupted when trying to cast a spell which happened much too frequently.The bad: Looking back at the game\, there's no doubt there was filler content or \""padding\"". I can count 6 of the 18 chapters that felt like unneeded\, stretched out padding levels\, that's 1/3 of the game. Even the content that's not \""padding\"" is presented in the same linear style as Final Fantasy 13. Nowhere is the padding more evident than the side-quests which are the lowest-effort side quests I've ever seen in a game. You are tasked with killing rats or finding cats. If you think the quests will get more complex\, you are mistaken.There's been much discussion of the textures in this game. I must admit as a PC gamer who bought a PS4 just to play this game\, I was taken aback at the texture quality throughout the game. I just chalked it up to it being a console game and felt that this is what console gamers had to deal with. However\, some of the textures are downright awful and oddly enough are used as set-pieces in certain chapters. You will often see texture pop-in and just overall\, some low quality textures throughout the game. To me\, this was easiest to ignore as I felt that this could be corrected when the game came to PC.If I was going to nitpick I'd say that the NPCs felt out of place\, certainly they did not have the look of slum dwellers. I've seen this done much better in other games that even came out of Japan (Yakuza for example).The ugly: The ending. The most coherent explanation was that the ending was metaphorically defeating the real life purists who wanted to see FF7 remastered faithfully. It seems that square-enix have given themselves a green light to make broad changes to the game. A bold move when you're selling an episodic game. I can't say that I will pick up part 2 and I was damn excited for part 2\, I thought that would be the meat of the game. Now\, much like Star Wars\, I guess the new Final Fantasy 7 was made for new fans\, not us original fans. I'll take a wait-and-see approach\, pre-ordering part 2 is laughably out of the picture now.This was a wake-up call for me. It caused me to give a hard look to the final fantasy series and made me realize that even though I played 7\, 8\, 9\, and 10\, the only one that actually stuck with me was Final Fantasy 7. it almost looks like it was an accident now\, an anomaly in the JRPG world. Well no longer\, now it gets to join the rest of the JRPGs with it's own nonsensical plot.… Expand"

In many way they came very close\, even improving upon some things\, but varying levels of polish and some stumbling towards the end detracted from the overall experience and creates concerns for the rest of the episodes.Pros:-Overall script and acting are superb\, Tifa\, Cloud\, and Jessie especially.-Cutscenes and direction are fantastic (I'm looking at you\, Wall Market!)-Great expansion of some areas you visit-Some great additional fleshing out of the characters and world-Battle system retains the necessity for strategy and gives a nice nod to the original\, while feeling fresh and more immersive with the added action elementsCons:-Overall uneven quality: Some parts of the game are breathtakingly beautiful\, while other parts look like they are from a Nintendo 64 game. It can be jarring to see beautiful environments laid out in front of a giant\, low resolution JPEG in the back ground or have beautiful main character models interacting with NPCS that look like they are on a PS3. Textures on doors\, railings\, flowers\, fences\, etc.. are especially lo-res. Latter half of the game in general feels like it doesn't quite have the polish of the earlier bits.-Pacing: While many of the additions to stretch this small section of the original to full game size are nice\, others feel like unnecessary padding and are often oddly placed. Several times in the main narrative\, you are told time is of the essence and the story builds up this great tension only to send things to a grinding halt a few minutes later\, hitting you with a series of side quests that involve you finding lost cats or kids.-The last part of the game feels rushed (in terms of development) and pacing becomes worse. What is an intense\, breakneck section with a sense of urgency in the original\, gets bogged down with more unnecessary padding. Dungeons are ill placed and certain sequences go on too long. Dialogue seems not as carefully crafted as the rest of game.-New narrative choices: Some major plot changes occur that come seemingly out of left field and conflict or don't feel in line with the themes of the original. They also have concerning implications for the rest of the project as well as SquareEnix's marketing for it....detailed below WITH LIGHT SPOILERS:*Spoilers*-End seems to imply this is a reboot and future installments may not follow the plot of the original. This could potentially be exciting\, however\, the plot developments that lead up to this are not very assuring. It also seems to be in conflict with Square's marketing of this project as an expanded\, \""faithful retelling\"" and interviews with the co-director who said the basic beats would be there.-Alot of powerful\, emotional scenes have their teeth taken away (Sector 7 Plate)-Changes in Shinra building felt like padding and an iconic scene was changed for one that seems to be more friendly to a Teen rating.-Narrative changes are confusing for veteran players\, who know who certain characters are or become\, but are especially unfriendly to new players. It is never established in this game who a certain character is\, why he is bad\, and why we should want to stop him. As a result\, the story seems to require that players have played through the original (but even then\, it still feels out of place).… Expand"

74909,FFVIIR,2020-07-12,1,"What a shame!I would have scored this game a solid 9/10 if it wasn't for some key changes to the story which transformed an otherwise excellent game into an major screw up.FF7 OG was a masterpiece. One of its strongest points was its dramatic\, coherent and cohesive story. All SE had to do with FF7R was to build on FF7 OG and improve it. And for the most part they did just that: the modern graphics\, character designs\, dialogues\, voice acting (at least in Japanese language)\, music and battle system are all excellent. Even most changes to the story are great *but* ultimately the addition of the arbiters of fate (the \""whispers\"") and alternate timelines are total nonsense that has no place in FF7's story. Ditto for the final boss fight with Sephiroth\, who should not have showed up so early in the story\, let alone be defeated considering how powerful he is supposed to be.I can't find the words to describe the feeling of extreme disappointment I was left with after finishing the game\, hence the bad overall score.Details:Graphics: 9/10Battle system: 9/10Gameplay: 7/10Sound: 9/10Characters and voice acting: 9/10Story: 0/10I will detail about score for the story by focusing on changes vs OG story.Positive changes:- The conversations and relationship building between Cloud and Tifa\, Aerith and Barret show a much deeper connection than in the OG.- The additional story with Jessie helps to be more attached to this character as well.- The argument between Barret and Shinra employees.- The addition of the Trio in Wall Market (specially Madam M and Andrea)\, the presenters of the Corneo Colosseum and Corneo's lackeys.- The scene where Elmyra tells you Aerith's story is even more emotional than in the OG.- Even the way and frequency of Sephiroth's appearances in Cloud's *imagination* are ok to me (some people complained that it \""kills\"" the mystery\, but I do not agree). In fact\, these appearances can be explained by Cloud's treatment with Jenova's cells -- as shown in the story of the OG.Negative changes:- Why make the first Mako reactor bomb fail and the explosion be triggered (amplified) by Shinra? It increases Shinra's responsibility for the pain and destruction and lowers that of the team of eco-terrorists.- Roche is a totally useless and forgettable character. He's just filler content that brings nothing to the story (and his totally unrealistic motorbike acrobatics do not help).Changes that really blew it -- these are the reason for the bad score!:- Basically\, anything related to the whispers and alternate timelines.- The whispers causing Jessie's injury (and her replacement by Cloud) is  unnecessary. Instead\, Cloud should have been made part of the team from the start\, like in the OG.- Why keep Wedge and Biggs alive? Their death was part of the emotional impact of the plate collapse in the original story.- In Shinra building's Cosmos Theater\, why can the team see the future (Meteor hitting Midgar)? It makes no sense... is this a clairvoyant Movie Theater?- Sephiroth should not appear at all in the game other than in Cloud's *imagination*. In FF7 OG\, we could only hear about Sephiroth or see the trail of what he had done\, gradually building the mystery around this character. For instance\, in Shinra building\, we saw Jenova chamber emptied\, followed a trail of blood leading upstairs\, and found president Shinra murdered.Instead\, in FF7R we get to see Sephiroth taking Jenova\, then follow a trail of blue goo (??) to find Shinra president left hanging from a ledge (who put him there?? Sephiroth??) only to be killed later by Sephiroth (why did he not kill him directly??)\, who also kills Barret (and Barret then resurrects like Jesus-Christ!!).- The last scene where suddenly Aerith becomes some sort of prophet\, the team enters a portal\, then defeats fate himself (represented by a giant entity that you fight on a floating cloud of debris above Midgar's skies!!)\, followed by Sephiroth (who you also defeat!!).- The last cutscene showing that Zack survived? Again\, this character's death by saving Cloud is a key part of the story. Why change it?I will not be buying the other parts until I see in the reviews that we are back on track in terms of story.… Expand"
74920,FFVIIR,2020-04-11,10,This game is just gorgeous. 23 years waiting and the wait was rewarded. I remember when I was a kid playing this game. My impression was wooooow look at that. And now with this graphics was the same impression. It's like I'm paying a movie or something. Beautiful game.
74922,FFVIIR,2020-04-18,5,"As I play this game I have two feelings. One of enjoyment and the other akin to a heartache. I'm 35 years old and I fondly remember playing the original Final Fantasy VII on my classic gray PSX. However\, over the years when I've gone back for a playthrough the one thing I always noticed was how bad the graphics really were. At the time they were pretty amazing\, but rose tinted glassesAs I play this game I have two feelings. One of enjoyment and the other akin to a heartache. I'm 35 years old and I fondly remember playing the original Final Fantasy VII on my classic gray PSX. However\, over the years when I've gone back for a playthrough the one thing I always noticed was how bad the graphics really were. At the time they were pretty amazing\, but rose tinted glasses never saved subsequent playthroughs for me because everything outside of cutscenes and pre-rendered backgrounds looked polygonal and bland. For that reason\, I've been a big proponent for a remake and have signed countless petitions asking as much. However\, the first definition for 'remake' is to make again which is what I\, as well as millions of other fans\, wanted.I'm not so spiteful that I'll score the game a 0 so I picked my score to reflect not only how I feel but what I thought of the game in general. For me\, it's a middling experience. I find myself enjoying certain character interactions and watching certain scenes that had a much needed and stunningly gorgeous graphical overhaul. However\, I'm not enjoying the action combat and overall changes to the story. I will not be spoiling anything outright\, but I will say that the ending of this first part sets up an entirely different story than the one we already know.The changes to the story and the fact the entire first part is relegated to Midgar is another reason why I'm scoring this so low. I've followed the development pretty closely and knew that it would only take place in Midgar. However\, I was always disappointed by that fact and will continue to eschew them for their greed in splitting up the game into parts. No one here can tell me when the next part will come out. It could be next year\, it could be two years from now or it could potentially be much longer than that. No one else can tell me how many DLC's we'll potentially be burdened with as well. And all of that scares me. And much like Final Fantasy XIII\, this game is a glorified corridor simulator but worse in the fact that at least by the end of XIII you had a big open area to do stuff in. And I'm honestly surprised more people aren't outraged by that seeing as how it was a big deal when XIII came out.I have other gripes as well. The summoning system was completely ruined. If we end up getting later parts I'm super curious to see how Knights of the Round works out. This action combat was just a horrible choice all around. Sure\, it looks cool and flashy but it's not what we wanted out of the remake. I don't know why SE keeps pushing away from turn based when their financial issues started when they began moving towards a more action based system. Their fans love turn based and would much prefer it over the spammy action system they now have. For example\, I liked Final Fantasy XV but I can tell you with 100% certainty it would have scored higher and been more popular if they had named it something else.The lack of turn based combat\, lack of an open world\, and significant story changes (specifically ending) have soured what could have been the best game of the year\, hell\, decade. Crappy business practices and the continued spitting in the faces of fans have further tarnished the reputation of what used to be a great company. For all of those reasons\, I give the game a 5/10 and hope that they will pull their heads out of their asses for future parts (but I won't hold my breath\, lol).… Expand"

74987,FFVIIR,2020-04-15,5,"The original Final Fantasy 7 is a top three game of all time for me and was my first real introduction into JRPG's on the whole\, and like so many others I have been asking for a remake of my childhood for countless years. What we got\, instead\, was nowhere near what the fans of the original had asked for. Scenes are incredibly out of place (some impactful ones like the shinra massacre just downright removed) and any of the emotional weight of character deaths is exacerbated by the ghosts out of KHDDD2 that work as functioning dragonballs. Another thing\, if you have not read any of the books\, seen advent children and played Crisis core and or before crisis\, most of the ending will not make sense. A lot of people I know were waiting for this to be their first pull into the FF7 universe\, thinking it was just an updated and upgraded original like how it was marketed\, but that is just not the case here. Without delving too much into spoiler territory this game is actually an alternate timeline sequel to the original events\, to which you also find out that the original Final Fantasy 7; the game that you spent countless hours on to explore the whole of Gaia and save the planet from meteor\, the game that taught you the importance of death and life being finite? Yes\, that ending is now considered the bad ending. I wish I was making this up. While that may just be my critiques for the story\, the idea of an expansion of this game was also falsely advertised. Minus just a single \""walk to Jessie's house\"" area\, there are NO new explorable areas from the original. There is no Sector 1 under city\, no Sector 2 and 3 and etc. So how is this 4-6 segment now a 30+ hour game? Because they added time to go from point A to point B. The collapsed highway in the original FF7? That's now a 1.5 hour long use robot arm mini game that adds nothing to the plot\, just tedium. Towards the end of the game as well\, the gameplay becomes a little ridiculous as enemies just start soaking up damage beyond belief to the point where even staggering will not work. Despite that however\, I did have a lot of fun with the combat except in shaky situations with a lot of enemies or certain camera issues.While I have only given critiques so far\, this game does have positives. For the most part\, the textures and graphics are something out of a CG movie. Yes\, there are many textures which are just atrocious and look like they are directly pulled from the original (the characters comment on this late in the game) but they were stunning for the most part. As stated before\, the gameplay was fun for the most part but it had its weird parts as well\, though the majority was positive. The materia system is kept nearly intact from the original\, and being able to use and level up all types of materia was also very rewarding and fun. Besides that\, I would like to talk about the music. The soundtrack in this game is absolutely spectacular and is one of the best I have ever heard in the medium. The music is dynamic\, and certain themes will strike an emotional toll with anyone who played the original (for me it was the remake of Ahead On Our Way). If anything else\, the music is this game is superb.With that said however\, this game assassinates what is Final Fantasy 7 in a fire so bright the Nibelheim incident looks tame. There are character assassinations\, plot changes that will make ones headspin\, and confusion and agony so abundant the final hour will be a torture for any fans of the original. If Final Fantasy 7 is an expensive painting I have in my house\, I have just been tied to a chair and watched as my most cherished piece has been destroyed.This game and \""Remake\,\"" if you could even call it that\, has been riddled with false advertisement and character assassinations like some would not believe; and the most depressing factor is: we will still most likely never see the Remake that so many of us fans have been asking for since that fateful PS3 tech demo. I hope the time jannies/changebad ghosts can come in and save this mess\, it's gonna take some major time travel.… Expand"
75004,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,10,Entertaining and full of fanservice tied to the original. New elements both storywise and mechanicswise makes it fresh and fun to play. Hardnode is very...very hard.
75012,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,5,"This is a review from an honest FF7 fan who played the original back in 1997. I will breakdown this review into sections as this game needs a thorough breakdown.Graphics - Inconsistent at best. As soon as you get to Sector 5 you get a beautiful 240p shot of the slums and it looks so out of place. You might think it is a one off but from this point forward the game gets littered with low resolution textures and NPC's everywhere. Some would rival the PS2. Main character models and particle effects look excellent. Environments look great at times and true to source but often a low res back drop ruins the moment or just flat out bad textures.Soundtrack - Good but not great. Some of the new arrangements of songs fail to hit the mark and are often inconsistently drowned out by sounds or the volume is too low. I never got hit with the same feelings as I did with the original.Combat - Fun for a bit but gets tiresome later on. Friendly AI more often than not does nothing. You need to attack to get ATB up but you can fill yours 3 times over before an AI gets one section done. The game has a lock on target system that does not truly lock on. You will often end up jumping across the stage attacking something you didn't want to. So don't even try moving the camera around for a better view in battle. Camera angle is very inconsistent and jumpy. Battles go from too easy to overly frustrating very quickly.Voice Acting/Dialogue - I see this praised a lot but I found it atrocious for the most part. The delay when speaking to an NPC or interacting with a character has a very unnatural pause as both people do a robotic animation to face each other. Most conversations just sound cheesy and unnatural and that isn't to say the main dialogue doesn't suffer from this too. Gestures often do not match what characters are saying which is immersion ruining IMO. Barrett humming the victory fanfare makes me want to rip my ears off.Gameplay - Horrible pacing. From slow walk conversation\, to crouch walking\, to keeping balance over wide planks\, or to the ever dreaded squeezing/shimmying between things. (These are obviously to hide loading sequences.) Side quests are nothing more than useless fetch quests to stretch the game. Yes they are optional but I always try to do these in FF games. These are the worst in FF history. Every small area is stretched out to repeating corridors and key fetching. These are boring and repetitive. Fighting the same boss twice just shows a lack of awareness and creativity from Square Enix. The bike sections are long and exciting for all but 2 minutes. Yes we all loved the motorcycle escape in the original but I don't think anyone enjoyed the 1 hour you spend on the damn bike over 2 sequences in this one repeating through the same environment over and over and over. I had to restart my game in 2 sections due to crashing from bugs. Once in the ducts in Shinra Tower and once in the final boss fights. Unacceptable for 2 parts you have to go through. Loved starting that fight back from the beginning.Story - Why did you do it Square Enix? You sold and advertised this game as a faithful remake but instead this game went full Nomura and now we are stuck looking forward to this? This is closer to a sequel. The new characters are forgettable at best (Roche\, Marle\, Leslie etc) and I really don't think we needed a trip to visit Jessie's parents. That whole part served 0 purpose like many other filler parts. The secret lab under Sector 7 where you fight hundreds of alien experiment things? Is this a joke? Does anyone even care what Shinra is doing at this point considering we get Sephiroth one hour into this and every hour after? One of the most epic moments in gaming history is believing Shinra is the big bad but waking up in the cell trying to break Aerith out and following the trail of blood to find Shinra with a sword through him stuck to his desk. Instead we fail at hitting Sephiroth and end up doing a boring Hojo lab grind? I won't even get into the ending because it is self explanatory. Dementors that only make sense to people who played the original like what is this crap?Personally I feel betrayed and hate the direction they are taking with this. There is already way too much FF7 content as is. Please bring FF16 before another part of this crap. I will not be buying the remaining parts of this. Count me out.… Expand"

Spoiler free as always.This game is clearly a love project\, a passion of the original creators of this game returning to make the version they always dreamed of making. And wow... did it show at every single detail. Even justA couple days ago\, I finished the first installment of the Final Fantasy VII Remake. Normally I keep my reviews short\, but I won't be able to do that this time. Spoiler free as always.This game is clearly a love project\, a passion of the original creators of this game returning to make the version they always dreamed of making. And wow... did it show at every single detail. Even just playing the first mission of the original game alongside playing the remake\, you see the attention to detail the developers made in recreating as much of the original as possible\, down to the locations\, character placements\, and even conversations the characters had. But this is no \""pure remake\""\, because everything is SO FLESHED OUT! The classic players had always wished Midgar was more explorable\, and boy did they deliver. City streets\, lively slums\, vibrant night lives. Midgar feels so alive now and I'm simply amazed with how much they were able to expand on this city\, all while keeping the same tone of the classic.Our location isn't all though\, the characters are so much more impactful this time around. Aerith & Barret in particular are so much more fleshed out than their classic counterparts it's unreal. Yes the whole cast was already lovable\, but with voice acting and proper cutscenes\, we get so much personality and character development now it's somehow even made them MORE lovable! And this doesn't just apply to the main cast! Biggs\, Wedge\, Jessie\, heck even President Shinra are all characters who leave an impact on the player now in some which way\, almost like there are no small parts left anymore. And the new characters who were lightly sprinkled in were a great deal of fun and fit perfectly into this world.The visuals of this game are nothing short of breathtaking. There's been a particular visual style Final Fantasy has gone for\, especially with VII's spinoffs like Advent Children\, Crisis Core\, etc\, but this game pushed all of those to the next level. Best part is the transitions are seamless\, like there's no points where the gameplay ends and the cutscenes begin. I felt like a nerdy high school boy all over again who wanted a game that felt like I was playing Advent Children\, and I got that and so much more. Even the boss battles were a cinematic experience\, in fact I even rewatched a boss fight on Youtube because it was like watching a movie clip. But that's the thing! You're still in full control! No quick time events\, no nonsense where the game takes over for too long\, it's a perfect balance!With the addition of side quests and the fun characters that come from there\, new areas to explore and people to meet\, and more time to expand on the story into the dreams and envisions of the creators\, it's an absolute treat to classic fans like myself because it feels like we're getting even more out of one of our favorite stories. There a certainly a fair amount of changes to the original story\, which will likely lead to larger plot changes down the line\, but with the way they're handling everything it all fits so perfectly well. This means classic fans and new fans alike can each have a new journey and new experiences playing these games\, while also living a timeless and charming tail of these characters and the journey they go on.Can I also just say that this game is just an absolute JOY?! Meeting Reno\, Wall Market\, and so many other iconic scenes from the first arc of the game with all the added flare and stunning effort put into them just blows me away. Like the imagination I had to use when I played this game over a decade ago came to life. Like somehow VII has always looked like this in my head\, but seeing it came to life gave me this weird feeling of rewatching a movie I've seen and also getting the movie adaption of the book I've always waited for.Both as a gamer and as a VII fan\, I honestly found not a single flaw in this game. The remastered orchestra blew me away\, the visuals and gameplay was flawless. I laughed\, my jaw dropped\, and I was given emotion to characters I never thought I would care about before until this Remake. Maybe there are some purists out there who didn't like this game\, perhaps they wanted everything completely unchanged and just wanted a pure remaster of the original game. But you know who didn't want that? The original creators\, and that's why they made this game again. This is the story they want to tell\, one that they all want to make while they're all still alive and making games\, and one they weren't even sure if they could make happen. Well it's happening\, I and several other VII fans are along for the rid.\, Even being the first part in a series (what will likely be a trilogy) of games\, I got a full game's experience\, and I would be surprised if any other game this year claimed my Game of the Year spot. See you soon gang\, I'm ready to go on one heck of a wild ride all over again.… Expand"
75060,FFVIIR,2020-04-14,10,"One of the best games I have ever plaid\, story graphics and gameplay all are in top square Enix form here!"
75065,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,5,"I found myself frustrated more and more as I continued to play through FF7R. Mainly because the highs are SO high and the lows are just that low. A score of 5 only felt right for the very mixed feelings I had playing it.Aspects that stick to the original game work really well\, I find myself grinning and giggling at points I’m enjoying\, but in the next minutes the new additions jump in and ruin the mood. New characters like Roche\, Kyrie\, Chadley\, and the whispers (see: Dementors) do not feel like they belong\, and even their character design shows this mismatch. Maybe if Roche didn't feel like an ex-Organisation XIII member from Kingdom Hearts\, and Chadley actually fit in with the aesthetic of the game\, they may have been good additions. And even though they spent time designing these characters\, they didn't take any time to get us interested in them at all.Rather than add new characters for the sake of it\, they could have spent that time adding to the stories of those we already know and love (Jessies side quest was great minus the Roche's motorbike skills) or working on some of the NPC's we need to speak to for the new sidequests which feel like filler and could have been more interesting. These sidequests also destroy pacing in this very 'hallway' game (that XIII got ripped apart for) and takes away urgency in areas of the story: \""A guy in black was seen going to your house\"" \""Ah I'm sure it's fine\, I need to find lost kids now or they won't let me finish this side quest\"".And speaking of characters we already know\, why the creative decision to make Wedge an overweight trope\, why not give us some backstory on who Wedge is as a person instead of just \""I'm hungry\"". And then he (and others) don't die where they had in the original\, too many convienient rescues in this game for characters who's deaths used to having meaning.Another point of frustration includes Cloud's multiple headaches and forever ruining any build up of tension leading up to Sephiroth. Are his friends not concerned about these headaches? And then they see Sephiroth is still alive and there is absolutely zero dialogue between Cloud and Tifa about this? There was no suspension\, and I was really hoping I wouldn't have to hear One Winged Angel in this installment of FF7. But I could have accepted it if the game had decided to end there...The ending. Square Enix shouldn’t have called it a remake if they were going to change it up this much\, it should be called Final Fantasy 7 Remix Final Mix 2.7 HD the amount of messing around they’ve done now\, digging Zack back out of the grave and cutting Crisis Core fans to pieces. Who Cloud was and how he got to be the person he is was defined in Crisis Core\, and bringing his friend back from the dead upset me as a fan of the originals.I dont think I'll be buying the next instalment\, I don’t want to feel what I felt after that ending again.All of this along with some plot changes that deviate from the original game really took the wind of the sails for me and had me sitting at an 8/10 for the majority of the game until the end happened.All that being said\, I couldn't put the game down while I was playing. The music\, combat\, original throwbacks\, Avalanche and team members are fantastic. The quality of the game is outstanding with a list of texture bugs here and there. I found myself frustrated purely because it's hard to have something SO good contrasting with what feels like forced new additions and in the very last minutes\, complete obliteration of the original storyline. I would be open to Square taking the game in a different direction but at least hire different writers that don't make it feel like I've just read a bad fanfiction online.… Expand"

75141,FFVIIR,2020-04-12,10,"I've read almost all user reviews. I really wanted to understand the criticism of these negative reviews. Now I get it.These so-called \""die-hard fans\"" just wanted to replay that PS1 title with upgraded graphics. They probably made a golden statue of one character in their own bedroom. To the pissed people\, the PS1 title is still available\, just go play it and deal with your angerI've read almost all user reviews. I really wanted to understand the criticism of these negative reviews. Now I get it.These so-called \""die-hard fans\"" just wanted to replay that PS1 title with upgraded graphics. They probably made a golden statue of one character in their own bedroom. To the pissed people\, the PS1 title is still available\, just go play it and deal with your anger management issues as visibly FF7R will not do the job! Square-Enix made an excellent decision by giving a very refreshing taste and a breathtaking AAA production. This game will make 95% of the fans extremely happy. There was no way they could make 100% of the fans happy. And some other people well\, you know you just need to accept the fact you're not playing this game with your 14 year old high school naive heart. You're seeing this game with grown up adult eyes which are more down-to-earth and reluctant to change.FF7 and FF7R will remain iconic forever. Period.The city of Midgar went from a few top down screens\, a few gimmick quests and a couple of great CGIs to a gigantic metropolis with a very living community. On top of that\, each district you visit really has its own vibe. You feel the impact of the main plot on their lives. You feel how Shinra controls and manipulates everything and every soul. That scene on the train after the bombing mission - that was unexpected great moment. On the PS1\, that scene is just Barret doing some yelling and bashing.Characters are stunning. Voice acting is great in general main and secondary characters. In my view that was the toughest challenge from SE to overcome. Storytelling when you just \""read\"" a text with a low-res polygon you need fill a lot of holes with your imagination (tone\, dramatization\, face reactions\,etc.) With the voice acting and the incredible amount of details nowadays\, there are no more room for imagination. Sometimes there are a few \""anime-like\"" lines normally seen in JPRGs from Jessie or Tifa - btw FF always have been JRPGs - but I can easily ignore this as I have so many reasons to keep me into the game.I just came back from a Distant World concert. The music in FF7R is just as great. Nostalgic melodies upgraded to the 21st century. Of course there are a lot more audio details than before such as ambiant sounds - on the PS1 it was just dead silent with a few midi sounds effect - so yeah it's possible you don't hear the music as crystal clear as before. Then just play with the audio settings if you care more about the music than the details. Problem solved.The battle system is really\, really good. The PS1 turn-based system was good back then\, but in today's world it would just be plain boring. I remember being annoyed by the necessary grind to level up - you run randomly in circles\, then the combat loading was slow\, etc. The new systems gives a sense of life or death tension on important battles that keep you on the edge. Also I was impressed at how characters interact with each other during combat\, it gives a lot more depth to the connections between them. It's not just a bunch of 3 cheezy quotes repeated a million times that you see in most similar games.Ladies & Gents\, this is equivalent of the Games of Thrones series back then when it was live over many years (forget the poor writing of S8). A huge plot\, released by episodes progressing at a turtle pace\, a LOT of captivating yet unnecessary details not related to the main plot to keep you entertained. But when something major happens to in the main plot\, it is grandiose.I wish for the day where i'll be able to do a whole playthrough and I truly hope that the games are connected to each other (inventory\, choices (if any)\, XP\, etc) and that it will be all be released on the same console (PS4). I don't mind if you need to purchase a PS5 to continue for future parts but at the VERY least make sure the PS4 FF7R game is backward compatible on the PS5 and that you don't have to rebuy it.… Expand"

They do not spoil story in any way\, but I felt like this warning was warrantedThis is an amazing game\, but it is not without it's flaws. It probably rates 5 stars but it should get a lower score based on some questionable design choices and development decisions.Pros: -stellar story. They have expanded on the main story and didnt ruin the heart of it with their additions. *-music is great. I didnt like all of the remixes\, but overall\, the music and sound was fantastic.-artwork was beautifully done. This game is stunning visually.-the list of pros is short because the game is great. It's far easier to nitpick at its minor flaws than to espouse everything it did so right. Do not take my longer con list as a bad thing.Cons:-corridore style. The original game was linear and corridory but we're in the future\, it could have been a little more open than it was.-block mechanic. If you're going to have a block mechanic AND make enemies bullet sponges\, block needs to animation cancel. It's already nearly impossible to see enemy attacks coming in the chaos\, allow us to block without forgoing doing all damage to wait for the attacks. I blocked only 4 or 5 attacks in the whole game because block was just entirely unneccessary and cumbersome.-canceled abilities due to attacks/enemies getting too far away after attack initiated. This more of a personal annoyance but limits especially should not suffer from enemy uses a dash during charge up so you miss entirely.-episodic nature. I was on board with the episodic nature until I heard square said each titles development would take as long as the first\, around 5 years. 5 years between titles is a very long time. A lack of info on how the episodes work is annoying as well. *-have to start every battle as cloud. Several aspects of the game only allow you action when if full control of a character. If you have a character switch function and you can play other characters in the world map\, there is no reason to not allow you to use another character as the combat starter.-squeeze through/slow walking. Look I understand the reason for these\, they are the new load screens\, but theres so many of them and they feel arbitrary.This ends the review. The next bit has the spoilery addendums. They arent major\, but they are what I'd consider spoilers.*the whispers was a bad choice of an addition. They serve\, what appears to be\, a macguffin designed to force the story to be like the original instead of simply making the story like the original. Also they are annoying at times.The you cant go here right now\, turn around mechanic is annoying instead of adding blocks to prevent you. It's also buggy\, I got locked into turn around moments 3 times in the game the longest being a 2 minute wait for the game to get me unstuck from moving forward into a you cant go here right now.*with lvl 50 being the cap\, there can be no real way to allow us to keep our gear/lvls/materia between games. A power reset is ridiculous and immersion breaking. There is only one way to fix one of these problems. An equal power but lvl reduction in episode 2\, basically your lvl 50 is episode 2's lvl 20. It still wont work though and it shows bad forethought.***if on the unbelievably likelyhood that someone with any real decision making power at square reads this. The deluxe edition of the game was near perfect in its execution. For a game going after nostalgia expanded\, the disk box should have had a user manual. Something that goes in the tabs on the box the disk comes in. It was the only part of the box I recieved I was mildly bummed about.***… Expand"
75242,FFVIIR,2020-04-18,8,"Spoilers aheadThe game is one of the most iconic\, brilliant and unique games you will ever play - even if you played the original - but there are quite a long list of things that it has got very wrong that stops it being at the same level as the original.1. Some things it should have done differently - it failed at\, like being less linear but instead the 'free roam' segments just send you back down the same linear paths you already travelled for very generic filler sidequests that serve little to no purpose. The linearity wouldn't be bad if not for the very poor attempt at simply extending the available play time\, but its fine where there's actual quality to be had which is true for 90% of the story segments. The cutscenes are fantastic fantasy/action goodness that you'll love if you're familiar with FF/JRPG cutscenes. The Honeybee Inn was just perfection.2. The story isn't faithful to the original. This will be a dealbreaker for many. Unfortunately\, Tetsuya Nomura seems to have turned this much loved story\, at least for the ending of part 1\, into a pretentious extridemensional time-travelling 'struggle against fate'. I hope\, damn near PRAY\, that the word 'fate' is never used in the sequels' stories. Just before the ending credits roll\, you're given the text \""The unknown journey will continue\""\, making it clear that from now everything will likely be different from the original. A real shame\, but there is potential in the FF7 world to create an amazing alternate tale IF they stay away from the 'fate and timeline' nonsense that has no place here.There's Shinra deepground\, the Tsviets\, the Turks\, Genesis\, Wutai\, the Weapons -- so much great content if they just keep it grounded but I have my doubts with the people in charge.3. There's such incredible variation in quality. Some moments you have the absolutely stunning main character models that I never tire looking at (Tifa's grey dress comes to mind)\, and then you have a PS2-era texture thrown at you. I'm genuinely not exaggerating. The door to Cloud's room early in the game is a blurred brownish-grey slab. I thought there was a problem with the game/my PS4 Pro with loading textures\, it was that bad. Bad textures are glaringly obvious and hard to miss that really makes you wonder what kind of budget/effort went into it.4. The combat is probably the best in an FF game since FF10. The ATB system adds a turn-based feel to otherwise realtime action. Though sometimes it suffers from feeling too 'in-the-moment' and not strategic enough for hardcore JRPG fans. Hard mode should have been available from the beginning\, not locked behind New Game Plus.5. Most of the characters have been brought to life perfectly. Barret\, Cloud\, Tifa and Aerith have perfect voice actors and they have so much personality and chemistry that gives me faith that\, no matter what story Nomura and co produce\, the characters will be the saving grace. Meanwhile\, Sephiroth was disappointing. His voice lacked that evilness to it and in terms of his character it was all over the place. Why can he timetravel? Why could he create a 'singularity' and take Cloud to the edge of creation? This isn't our Sephiroth. He isn't even scary powerful and we shouldn't have been able to fight him in part 1 at all.The game is a real mixed bag if you're a fan of the original.… Expand"
75248,FFVIIR,2020-04-20,10,"I went into this remake thinking that I would very much dislike it. How could SE possibly capture the wonder of the original after so many recent fumblings with the FF franchise? Well\, was I ever wrong.It is so clear\, even from the first 20 minutes of the game\, that Square put every effort into making this game a wonderful and heartfelt homage to the original. So much detail\, depth\,I went into this remake thinking that I would very much dislike it. How could SE possibly capture the wonder of the original after so many recent fumblings with the FF franchise? Well\, was I ever wrong.It is so clear\, even from the first 20 minutes of the game\, that Square put every effort into making this game a wonderful and heartfelt homage to the original. So much detail\, depth\, and thought was put into every facet\, from the character designs\, to the level layouts and puzzles\, to the updated combat. They must have spent hours pouring over things from the original game in an effort to remain true in spirit in this Remake.Characters: the characters (even the side characters) are all brought to life in beautiful\, cutting edge\, graphics. I was worried that their personalities would have been dumbed down\, but no\, they remain the wonderful\, nuanced characters we have always known and loved. And the voice acting\, I'm happy to say\, isn't just passable...it's downright good! Added time with the core Avalanche crew and Shinra goons is just icing on the cake.Gameplay: Everything is here: exploration\, combat\, item and materia management\, and they NAILED it. I was a huge opponent of changing the combat system\, but SE has truly given me something I didn't even know I wanted\, and I am SO glad they did. The combat feels fun\, fresh\, and exciting! Each character has their own unique moves\, stats\, and abilities that make them each their own unique assess to a party composition. The combat feels surprisingly real. Even placement matters; you can't just iframe out of an attack. You really need to be aware of your surroundings to make it through some of the more challenging encounters. And the challenges are present\, at least on the mode on which I played (Normal). It was exhilarating bouncing between characters\, attacking and issuing commands\,  syncing their unique abilities\, and taking down huge foes with flashy grace. Most enemies\, and especially the bosses feel almost like mini puzzles that you have to solve in order to take them down. Again\, SE could have dialed it in and made it a cash grab purely on nostalgia value (see: RE3 Remake)\, but decided to really put their heart and soul into it and make engaging and fun gameplay.Environments: wow...just wow. Most of the environments in this game are absolutely stunning. There were many times where I would just stop and circle the camera around my character in order to take it all in. Each major hub feels so unique and full of life. Again\, they somehow managed to get it all right; it's actually incredible to me. Aerith's house\, the church in the slums\, the Shinra building\, the Mako reactors\, Wall Market\, all of these places are so incredibly faithful to the original imaginings of them that I would actually chuckle in glee when I would discover little nods to the original game (e.g. barrels in the church\, sad old man in the diner in Wall Market\, moveable trains in the train graveyard!). I was legitimately moved by some of the set pieces in this game\, and I really can't remember the last time I felt that way about a game.Music: This. This may truly be the standout. Absolutely incredible. My wife would actually walk into the room and say things like \""wow\, this piece is beautiful\"" or \""wow\, that's a real banger\, huh?\"". All of the music from the original game is adapted to full orchestral tracks. Many of the original's more memorable themes have leitmotifs and adaptations that are used throughout the whole experience and really add a sense of cohesion to the game. The battle themes are particularly incredible\, although pretty much every area's track (yes\, even the new ones) will stick in your brain for months to come.Negatives: Many people say the game is bloated and that the side quests are boring and don't add much to the story. I didn't find the sidequests to be any different from the sidequests in most other JRPGs or even western RPGs. Not all games have Witcher III quality sidequests\, and the ones present here are refreshing\, fun\, and offer either a good reward\, a chance to explore\, or a nice nod to series lore that will bring a smile to your face.I do\, however\, agree that some of the areas (in particular\, the dungeons) could have been trimmed a bit. I felt like they went on just a little longer than they needed to\, and would from time to time disrupt the narrative pacing of the game. I aimed for as close to a 100% completion as I could on my first play through and near the end of the game\, I felt a little weary. Weary not of the good parts (of which there are sooo many)\, but of the longer dungeon slogs.All in all this is a triumph. I know some people have avoided it due to not all of the story beats being the same. I can understand the frustration. That said\, I loved the way it all ended\, and I couldn't recommend this game more if you're a FF7 fan. It gave me chills\, it made me shed a tear\, it made me laugh. Cloud is back and better than ever!… Expand"

Arguably one of the most cherished RPG's and video games of all time! It was only a matter of time before we were blessed with a proper remake/reintroduction into this beloved game. In my 52 Hours total gameplay\, I can firmly say that this game is by no means a masterpiece\, but still a fantastic game none the less!It's clearly obvious that Square Enix/ Tetsuya Nomura took some added liberties to change a few key aspects of the game\, some for good\, others not so much. For one\, the game is taking place solely in the city of Midgar\, which in the original game was about the first 5-8 hours that covered sections of the city. While it was a let down seeing that the game was going to be episodic\, this first part does a great job in setting up the City\, Characters\, and the overall arching plot that leads to some breathtaking fights and set pieces.Although the entire story isn't in full display in all of its glory\, it does make up for in its intricate and fast pace combat system that breaks away from its original turn-based roots\, and switches over to a more hands-on action-based style system that improves upon borrowed elements from FFXV and Kingdom Hearts 3\, and has become one of my favorite battle systems of all time. Your ATB gauge builds as you use your normal attacks\, then once filled up\, you can unleash a plethora of varied and flashy special moves\, spells\, and summons. Though the combat system may look simplistic\, don't be fooled by thinking that you can win every battle just by mashing the attack button. You'll want to carefully map out who your strategy depending on the enemy type your up against and mix in a good dose of Offensive attacks\, like a normal attack\, Spells\, Guarding\, and dodging.The later enemies and boss types will test your ability to use all that you have learned from your first few hours of playing. Graphically this game\, in my opinion\, is visually one of the most visually inconsistent games I have seen in quite a long time. In some areas\, the characters\, and environments rival those seen in the FF7 Advent Children movie from 2005\, in other parts\, spacially the textures for the backgrounds and objects like doors\, fences\, rocks\, and other little environmental additions look like low polygon PS1 textures. I'm not sure if that was done on purpose as some type of throwback to the OG PS1 game\, but it would be pretty hilarious none the less\, lol. the Voice and sound direction are also borderline perfect. Cloud's stoic sometimes quite demeanor is perfectly fitting. Berret embraces his Mr. T gruffness to a T\, \""No pun intended\"" Tifa's elegant charm is a delight to hear at any moment she has the spotlight\, and airth's cheerful and upbeat personality and joyfulness bring a fresh breath of joy into not only her character but the party as a whole.With the main cast being livelier as ever\, the true star of the game is the city of Midgar itself. It's a fully realized city that is filled to the brim with life as the other characters around you make you feel like you are apart of their world. Since the entire game focusses on the city\, you will come across various side quests along with your playthrough\, some of them are hit and miss.The majority of them will have you look for children/Animals\, go here hunt down this monster\, come back and receive your reward\, standard stuff. I thoroughly enjoyed my 52 hours playthrough\, immensely. The game will run you about 35-40 hours for a complete normal playthrough\, side quests in all. Then you unlock Hard mode which I am currently on\, which will give you easily another 40-50 hours. Final Fantasy 7 Remake does have its good share of flaws and the ending will definitely leave an everlasting impact on the Fanbase as a whole\, good or bad. This is still a fantastic game\, that every FF7 fan and JRPG fan alike\, old and new should definitely experience! 9/9. I am eagerly waiting on the next installment… Expand"

75316,FFVIIR,2020-05-04,8,"Its really challenging for me to review this game\, ive been anticipating this for so many years. Im a huge ff7 fan all the way back when the original was first released. I preordered the deluxe addition and followed the news on it very closely all the way up to release. Now thats out of the way\, lets get to the actual review.Graphics: This is a mix bag... i played this on a 4k tv\, ps4 pro. half this game is beautiful\, especially the main characters. Cloud is probably the best looking character model in existence right now\, showing detail all the way down to tiny hairs on his arms and neck. Some of the backdrops are gorgeous. Unfortunately the other 50% has hideous low resolution textures and awful pop in everywhere. It seems like the game only loads textures that are being zoomed in on and anything at a distance wont load the resolution fully. idk if this is a graphics glitch or a compromise they had to make. Some backdrops look like puke smeared all over the screen... With games like red dead redemption 2 and god of war looking near perfect on ps4\, im not really sure why the graphics take a quality hit here. Probably a excuse to sell us the \""enhanced mercenary edition\"" on ps5 and PC.Gameplay: it took me awhile to get used to this hybrid combat. I had more than a few frustrating boss fights and encounters where i was stun locked\, knocked down repeatedly or aggravatingly put to sleep\, shocked or froged. When things are going smoothly and you figure out what to do\, the combat is amazing. But its not without its flaws and has a learning curve. Half the side quests in this game are bad padding. Some are good. Some are decent... Its the main story quests where this really shines and has the best gameplay\, though some areas are dragged on a little longer than id prefer.Music and sound: is perfect. They took songs from the original and enhanced all of them in every possible way. Love the sound track for this game\, you can really hear the love and passion the composers had. The character voice actors all do a fantastic job.Story: this is the hardest thing for me to judge and rate in the game and probably the main reason i cant rate it a 10. This has been advertised as a true remake of the original only with story and graphics improvements. But what was delivered is more like a sequel\, which would be fine if it would of been marketed that way... i knew there would be some changes to the game and i was fine with that\, fleshing out story points and areas is great and for the most part they do exactly that. But then they add in these stupid plot ghosts that aggressively get in your way\, break immersion and story flow. Towards the end squareenix starts taking more and more liberties with the story changing things\, keeping characters alive\, etc... At the very end things just go flat out bonkers. throwing the party into a alternate dimension fighting some kind of giant kingdom hearts looking fate destiny demon\, which leads to a epic advent children style final boss battle with sephiroth. Afterwards they show Zack alive\, implying anything gos now in the story and to expect that anything can happen. Basically my understanding is Sephiroth has manages to time travel from advent children into the OG timeline and hes trying to get revenge while also trying to prevent cloud from stopping meteor. I dont hate this idea\, im a huge sephiroth fan. But they could of done this without the annoying whispers of fate ghosts and without prematurely blowing their load early with the Sephiroth boss battle that should of been saved for the very very end of the remake games. Sephiroth is never explained or understood for new players\, so it makes no sense for this giant fight to happen.  Sephiroth is suppose to be a ominous threat that lurks in the shadows\, mysterious and feared. Not in your face and beaten in the first story arc... good luck toping that in the next games\, are they just going to make us fight sephiroth over and over?? Showing Zack so early is also a plot mistake. New players know nothing about Zack\, older fans will be confused hes being introduced early. A big thing that makes the OG game great is learning at THE END who zack is and learning about Clouds personality disorder. Showing Zack early ruins this\, because now new players are just going to google who the black haired guy is and spoil a very important plot mystery. Well done squarenix.TLDR story summary: Ultimately\, adding time travel\, alternate dimensions and different time lines is a story and plot nightmare. its very difficult to pull off and do correctly in a coherent way. Leaving me very worried for the next games. I feel they would of been better off taking the safer route and following the resident evil remake examples\, not changing core aspects of the story and flow.… Expand"
75319,FFVIIR,2020-04-23,6,"Finally did the Platinum\, and ready to give my thoughts on the game.  Played and reviewed on a base PS4.Definitely a ride of peaks and big dips.Music is excellent\, cut scenes epic\, the bosses mainly amazing\, the characters and the combat\, in spite of the inflexibility of managing Materia\, was the most fun I've played in a long time.  Also the story was engaging to me\, and found certain scenes even got some emotional response\, which rarely happens in films or tv for me\, let alone in video games.Materia is key in hard mode.and having to switch it around on the fly is a requirement.  No presets or load out switching here unfortunately\, it's all about swapping around those blobs\, and remembering or knowing what you were in case you want things back again.  But learning about everything the combat had to offer through the Materia acquired was a real pleasure.Side quests?  Terrible\, absolutely a chore to do.  I'm not talking about the VR missions\, those were cool.  In fact anything involving an arena battle type sim is fine by me too and some damn hard battles to grind toward the end of hard.  The terrible stuff are the fetch quests\, repeating same areas multiple times back/forth\, and talking with cringe or cheesy NPC's\, be it a little girl looking for lost cats... or fetching music discs to make other cringe unhappy NPC's get up and be not-unhappy\, just happy cringe NPC's.There's also a hapless side quest strand individual called 'Johnny' who turns up\, and is a super annoying \""Bro\"".  Most of the side stuff felt like would appeal to my 13 year old self\, whereas the mostly engaging main story is for grown-ups. It's just a strange contrast.  I'm not even against side-quests in principle.  I've played games with great side-quests.  These just aren't it\, and totally go against the main story\, and highs elsewhere.The reason the game isn't getting into the high 8's or 9's is because of its flaws\, which are extreme to me.  There's also some issues where textures are not the same quality\, or not loaded correctly.  Contrast the average chapter 15 with its PS1 background with 16 for instance.  It's oddly mixed\, suggesting they couldn't work something out ahead of launch\, and left it as is.  Not that it affected gameplay.The game is linear.  Which is fine for me\, but some people seem to dislike linearity in game design these days.  For me\, coming off the likes of Far Cry 5\, some linearity was welcome this time.  That said\, there are definitely a couple of areas that open out\, with a few alleyways and the like\, but it's not that open and not that interactive\, either.Also\, the ending is confusing\, because the producers have decided to add in some timey wimey space time alt universe nonsense\, which will hopefully make sense in 3 or 4 years when they get around to the next game but the story overall was easy to follow until the end part.Other things I appreciated: the difficulty spikes\, especially in hard with the last few bosses\, the bike race segments\, the amazing visuals in certain areas\, e.g. Shinra.  I also personally liked the voiced acting in general\, although Barret started to become super annoying \""duh duh du du du du duuuur\""\, etcYeah\, a 6 is fair.  Expectations mostly met\, though major lows throughout as well. There's a lot of game here\, even if some of the side content is very questionable.  Part 2 could be special if they take the best of this game\, lose some bad ideas and possibly expand on the world to be a bit more open and interactive.… Expand"

The nonsensical\, new **** (literally quoting IGN here) *additions* is what ruins everything\, just like a spoon of tar ruins a whole barrel of sweet honey.Jessie getting more backstory and actual parents and expanded background? Absolutely great.Biggs or Wedge or both survive? Fine too\, it was done more or less naturally.

This game is Final Fantasy 7-2. I wasn't expecting the game to be an exact remake. Sure I expected certain parts to be flushed out more\, but this game just throws it all away to rewrite everything. This isn't a remake in the sense of remaking the game with better graphics and such. This is remake in the sense that Nomura and his turd Kingdom Hearts crew are remaking the game how they want it.Parts that would take 10-20 minutes in the original take up to an hour. Mostly because you're required to walk slowly or squeeze through tight areas. When you're not doing that\, you are doing side quests that are taken from any run of the mill MMORPG.  You have classics LIKE: find the mcguffin and return it to the owner\, defeat X amount of enemies\, and defeat unique enemy to get mcguffin and return it to the owner. What fun! I sure remember in the original when Cloud and co had to find cats and defeat rats for people. It doesn't even ADD to the lore of the game world. It's just padding and it's boring. I find myself just zoning out or skipping dialogue from scenes that weren't in the original because the dialogue is cringe and bad. Especially the character Jessie. This character went from neutral to cringe in an instant. Hate the character so much.Speaking of characters. What has happened to Tifa and Aerith? The dialogue is written and spoken in such a way to appear as a waifu material. It's so disgusting. I hated getting Aerith finally in my party because of her cringe cutesy dialogue as you're trying to get to Wall Market. Not to mention\, I'm not a fan of this dialogue as you're walking around. It doesn't add anything to the game.I knew things weren't going to go well when in the first hour\, Sephiroth appears. Just. What. ARE. THEY. THINKING!? Apparently the plot has something to do with going against fate/destiny. So\, this game is some kind of alternate universe to the original. It was falsely advertised. That's right. This is a sequel because there is no way a new player could understand just what is going on. Nothing is explained very well at all UNLESS you've play the original game.The staff who made this game have no freaking clue what made the original great. Fans didn't want a story on fan fiction levels. Fans didn't want to see scenes taken directly from Advent Children in Final Fantasy 7. Fans wanted a game with the same major story beats as the original and having it in great graphics with some minor additions.Combat is horrible and can take up to 20-30 minutes just to finish a boss battle. The battles are so padded out. When you do a certain amount of damage\, they'll be a cutscene or something. I'd hate to die just to sit through these cutscenes again. The character AI is so stupid. I wish you could program it to perform certain moves to help out like Final Fantasy 12 but nope. Instead the AI just seems to stand around only to get hit. I constantly have to be switching characters to put in the moves I want. And when you're not controlling a character\, why does their ATB guage take SO long to even get ONE BAR!? With this kind of action RPG combat\, it can get very stressful. It's not particularly fun. Especially on boss battles because they're giant damage sponges.I don't really remember using materia a whole lot at the beginning of the original game. Mostly just healing magic\, but now you're required to equip all different kinds of materia because enemies now have weaknesses. You have to exploit these weaknesses to cause enemies to stagger. Wow\, since when did Final Fantasy 7 become Persona 5? It's such a pain to go into a battle and not have the correct materia on. Be prepared for that because it'll happen often. Trash mobs should not take 10 minutes to defeat because you can't exploit the weakness and stagger them. This is what I hated about the combat in Final Fantasy 13!Because of how tedious combat and plot pacing is I could never see myself playing this game ever again. I've played the original numerous times since I first played it back in 1997. Not only is combat tedious\, but there is no exploration. In the original game\, I get to a new town or area of course I want to walk around and check things out. But this game is so on rails everyone is holding your hand and telling you what you can and cannot do. That's not fun at all. You can't even explore or interact with the towns. It's all just painting on the wall to look lived in. It's so bizarre to see 3 or 4 of the same looking NPC in a row right next to each other. Did they not even think about the placement?You fooled me once Squreenix shame on you. You won't fool me again. I'm not supporting Final Fantasy as a franchise anymore.

I have played and finished the original\, and because of that\, there are numbers of elements that made me disappointed with this remake.First off\, the padding\, and no matter who looks at it\, this is a fact. Some part of the dungeon was really redundant like the ship grave\, sewage and especially both of the Hojo's labs. Was all of these necessary? Did any of the dungeons I've listed developed a major character development like the Jesse's arc? No would be the answer. Sure there were some interactions\, but all of them could've been done on different area\, I could just skip or cut the whole dungeon part and I would see no difference on story progression from before and after entering the dungeon. Hojo's lab was the worst\, because you learn absolutely nothing new as you progress the lab other than Hojo is a mad scientist\, where in other news water is wet. Whether you like it or not\, you get to know a lot more about Hojo after getting out of Midgar\, so showing that this guy is a freak by making you go through useless dungeon is not a smart idea.Second\, the combat system. This is not a problem if you're on easy\, but anywhere higher literally shows all the bad parts of the combat. The reason is the amount of attack from the enemies can be really annoying\, like you getting attacked in middle of healing immediately cancels the animation for whatever reason. Not only that\, the game won't give you back the gauge you have spend on the action to cast the spell and I think that's disgustingly unfair considering all the enemies on late game have super-armor (unless you stagger them but that's not the problem). Another thing is that I hate how some of the attacks can be unfair where it's nearly unavoidable. If there is an dodge mechanic\, wouldn't it make sense to have certain amount of frame that gives you invincibility? Take a look at monster hunter for this one\, it makes you feel fair if the game gives you the chance of not taking any damage\, but the remake doesn't. They make you eat all the damages without giving you a chance of getting up. even guarding won't reduce the damage a lot. In hard mode\, all of these gets worse plus even the weak ones are took too long to beat\, which made me gave up on hard run due to it being a waste of time.Third\, the whispers. Why do these exists? They only made the story more annoying to look at the moment you know what these things are\, especially the beginning. Doesn't matter if they play a major role on the sequel\, this is not the kind of things you want that never existed on the first place. If they really meant for a build up\, then they could've at least made a new character instead of making a swarm of gross looking ghosts.Fourth\, take this as my nitpick\, music. Half of them were good/okay\, the other half was a shame towards Nobuo Uematsu's original musics. Like the Jenova's theme was exactly I expected and I loved it. I also kind of liked the airbuster's version of \""those who fight further\""\, but the rest of the versions of  \"" were terrible\, they don't sound like the original in terms of epicness (like not including the electric guitar). The wall market's theme got changed instead of the very fitting 'oppressed people'. If you like them\, fine\, this is my opinion after all.The positives are the environment being top notch\, really makes you grasp how it feels like to live in Midgar. Looking forward to the remake version of Junon\, Cosmo Canyon\, Forgotten Capital and Wutai. The turks were also what I've expected\, loving those dudes including Rufus so far. I don't know if the devs will ever include the rest of the turks\, but I would really love to see them.… Expand"

75439,FFVIIR,2020-04-11,4,"As a longtime\, devoted fan of Square Enix and the original FF7 and the other spin offs\, this has to be the worst one. Yes. Worst than Dirge of Cerberus\, worst than Crisis Core\, and most certainly\, worst than the original FF7. There are spoilers down below so read at your own risk\, i have marked them accordingly.When playing this game in the beginning\, I was rather excited for the invigorating game play\, the stellar level designs\, and the beautiful character. As the game progressed\, it quickly went downhill.1. I will say\, the gameplay was what kept me on my feet but the boss battle lasted WAY too long and did become repetitive.  My BIGGEST problem was how the first 30 hours of the game was just milling around in Midgar doing meaningless fetch quests just to earn some boring character cut scenes. While I did like exploring Midgar a little more\, it was nothing like they marketed. It isn't really open world nor as expansive as they tried to advertise it as. In reality\, this is the biggest marketing gimmick I've ever seen.2. The voice acting was alright in the beginning\, and then it just hit a brick wall. The voices are jarring and bland\, it pulled me out of the character immersion\, the characters became rigid and in the end\, it was very stale and unbelievable. It was as if I was watching inexperienced actors table read a script for the first time. Not what is to be expected in a Triple A game. Get Troy Baker\, Jennifer Hale\, and Nolan North in there and have them voice everyone\, it would sound a million times better. Heck the original cast would have nailed it better than this cast.3. The storyline (will contain endgame spoilers) . Boy oh boy\, this is where it tanked for me. If you were expecting just a little shuffle with the story\, a little additional content with the backbone of FF7\,  this game isn't for you. It completely re-wrote FF7 within an hour's time. Not only that\, Sephiroth appears WAY too much and does not have that mystery surrounding him. They are shoving this character in your face as much as possible. FF7R is like a sequal to Advent Children in the way that both Cloud and Sephiroth have traveled back to the past to relive the events of the original but both battling to stop it with their Advent Children selves...or something like that. The dead to not stay dead\, they NEED to stay dead. It's like they saw how popular these characters were in the past and then wanted to keep them alive for a cash grab. Not cool man\, part of the reasons we like them is because of their sacrifice. They made this game to be a giant \""what if\"" where you can't take characters deaths seriously. It's ridiculous.4. The music is lackluster at best. It looks like they took Uematsu's compositions and then just butchers them and then stuck his name in the credits to try to appeal to fans. It's not well done. Don't get me started on the Chocobo rap\, hip-hop thing.All--in-all\, this game does not live up to the hype it is receiving. It was a huge letdown. I don't really have faith in them to fix this for part 2\, but I sure hope they will see what dumpster fire they created.… Expand"

75497,FFVIIR,2020-04-13,1,"I must admit\, I registered Metacritic just to review this game. Also\, English is not my native language so please\, bear with me if something is not written correctly.Oh man... I don't even know where to begin.Let's start by saying that I have played the original when I was 15 years old or so\, completed every sub-mission and beaten all optional bosses. I loved that game\, but not to the point to be considered a purist fangamer; in fact\, I was totally opened to some changes and/or insights.That being said\, what I had got is a beautiful empty box.Let's begin with the battle system. As someone else here has already written\, this system is plagued with an incredibily bad AI. The other two party members\, except auto-atttacking enemies\, do absolutely NOTHING during the fight so you have to manually switch on them each time just to fill ATB gauge. This would be rather fine in a turn-based game\, but this is not the case since this game \""should\"" be an action RPG. The result is an extremely boring mode in which the system itself actively plays against you instead of relying on game mechanics. Not only that: the CS is also based on staggering enemies... too bad the staggering gauge resets every time a boss changes phase - and this happens multiple times during a fight!Pacing is also atrociously bad. The game even mocks you when Aerith forces Cloud to pick a route saying that this was a shortcut when\, in reality\, it was the exact opposite! The game is about 50 hours long and it covers about 5 hours of the original game\, but instead of filling those extra 45 hours with more in-depth analysis of the characters and the lore in general\, they force the player to undergo some soporific sub quests which seem to take forever to accomplish as they are basically fetch quests that don't add absolutely anything new to the plot.Dungeons\, while might be visually astonishing\, are just a bunch of hallways very reminiscent of the ones I had already experienced in FF13. They are also long and totally uninspired.In other words\, the game does literally in its power to stretch the playtime as much as possible with gimmicks and useless content.Soundtrack had all the premises to be great and memorable: unfortunately most of the best tracks can be heard just a bunch of times during the whole gameplay\, while the others are inappropriately placed (like the original World Map theme played in the first slum...). This without ever mentioning all the new pieces which are absolutely nothing compared to the greatness of Uematsu's.This \""rape-the-original\"" attitude has its peak in the storyline.I don't want to sound a purist here\, but when you are working on someone else's plot (especially in a remake project as this is supposed to be) you should take into consideration what was the aim of the author and what s/he wanted to convey. Of course\, Nomura didn't do any of this. Instead\, he deliberately lied to the public\, by stating it was a remake\, while\, in reality\, this is not even a reboot.Not only Nomura is bad writer\, in the sense he cannot write anything good on his own\, but he is not even able to copy other people's ideas. For example\, the entire plot twist of this game is based on Anno's concept of treating a reboot as an alternate universe chronologically placed after the events of the original work (see Neon Genesis Evangelion). And remember that\, unlike Nomura\, Anno was basically \""rebooting\"" and handling his own source material which is something that\, unlike Nomura\, had the right to do\, being Neon Genesis Evangelion his own project.Nomura\, on the other hand\, had this arrogant attitude of picking a story that doesn't belong to him\, taking advantage of its fandom and its foundations just to completely overturning its original meaning\, probably believing that he was a much better writer; skilled and superior enough not to waste his time to read and understand the original script.I'm so sad to write this review.I'm so sad to have played a game so poorly executed.I'm also so sad that players nowdays are happy with nothing.Let me say this: you deserve better than a mediocre Final Fantasy 7 fanfic\, although beautifully packed.You deserve better: and certainly not this game.… Expand"

The new additions in between are shallow and vapid\, which is par for the course with modern Square. They love to write based on what they think looks or sounds cool in this weird anime style\, rather than what is actually good for a mature narrative. This is in contrast to the classic games\, meaning often plot points come across awkwardly\, or miss the mark as far as the tone of the original portrayal is concerned. The biggest problem with the remade scenes is that they are turned into a chase and dangled in front of you like a carrot on a stick.In the original game\, one major plot point to another took less than an hour. In the remake\, I measured 5 hours between those same plot points\, with nothing relevant to the story happening at all. Just diversions of filler crap\, and this is while avoiding optional content. The game deliberately delays you to expand your playtime\, makes sure animations take as long as possible\, and everything just generally takes longer than it should. Areas overstay their welcome.The remade music is often faithful. The battle and boss themes\, for example\, are stellar. But they are only heard once or twice throughout the entire game. Enjoy the Airbuster fight while it lasts\, because you won't hear the boss theme in its faithfully remade form again.For a lot of scenes\, Square didn't even bother to remake the classic music\, and instead replaced it with completely new music. And where the classic music was always catchy\, anthemic\, melodic\, and memorable\, the new music is the equivalent of musical rambling. Strings that go nowhere and say nothing. Sound that exists purely to fill the space. I was amazed in several areas by how boring\, even annoying the music was to listen to. It was very reminiscent of FF13 in style\, and sometimes it completely defied the tone of the scene it was accompanying. This is tone deaf treatment of a game that is famous for having one of the greatest soundtracks of all time.The battle system is mostly okay. It's an evolution of FF15\, which wasn't good to begin with\, but there are several boss battles that are genuinely challenging and fun to play\, and those are the times when it shines. Airbuster and Abzu are notable. Unfortunately\, the rest of the time\, it amounts to spamming square to cut through the trash so you can move on. Dodge roll feels awful and rarely seems to do what it's supposed to do. A monster will wind up for an attack\, you'll roll to the side thinking you can evade it\, and then it will snap towards you and strike you anyway\, making the roll useless.Sometimes it feels like Sweeper is the only monster in the game. You're watching a long cutscene\, things are getting a bit intense\, you can tell there's going to be a battle. I wonder what it will be? It's another Sweeper! Yay! It's almost comical how many times this happens. Square apparently are really proud of this monster and want you to never stop fighting it. You will get sick of it.But the worst thing about the battle system is the camera. It truly is terrible\, and you will find yourself inputting commands while looking at nothing as the battle rages on somewhere behind you. You'll get frustrated as you fight the game just to get the camera looking at what it should be looking at\, and then when you finally do\, the characters will roll around each other\, causing the camera to do weird things. Strangely\, the camera in FF15 was equally as terrible\, and Square has evidently learned nothing from it.If you appreciate narrative in games\, you will hate the closing scenes. Period. Convoluted and very reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts\, Square has arrogantly retconned the original story in favor of a load of nonsense\, because they are desperate to do better than the greatest game they've ever made\, without an understanding for why the original was so beloved my many. I feel that Square were only concerned with pumping out another dose of Cloud and Sephy with flashy Advent Children style battles\, thinking the story around them is irrelevant. They are right\, unfortunately\, that this is all some people want. But to me\, the story is inseparable from the characters. And certainly\, if this version of FF7 is what was released back in the 90s\, it would never have become the cultural phenomenon that it did.As a standalone game\, it's just not good. Where old players will be upset at the story changes\, new players will not have a clue what's going on at any time\, because despite the playtime of Midgar being padded out to ~30 hours\, nothing is actually given time to be explained. Who is this guy with long white hair who keeps appearing\, why should we care\, and now why all of a sudden are we fighting him? In a nutshell\, the game is all style with very little substance.I'm left feeling that this game only exists as a set up for the next\, where Square now has a free pass to go REALLY off the rails.… Expand"
75522,FFVIIR,2020-04-10,2,"I fell like i should have seen this coming. For the first hour or so\, i was sold. If i put it down after two hours in\, i'd have rated it a 10.The story just derails so quickly. I don't know exactly when it happened or at what point\, but i just realized i was bored to death. After the first mako reactor blows up\, its like a completely different game. A little added content is always appreciated\, always helps flesh the story out\, but this game quickly hits the point where it loses sight of the original story completely and ends up going down mindlessly boring tangents.Then\, at one point\, it hit me and i remembered having read something a while back about how Square Enix planned on putting this out in episodes. Suddenly\, it all made sense; all the mindless padding\, the drawn out cutscenes\, needless dialogue and slow animations. They have done literally everything they can to draw this installment out while adding nothing of real substance to the experience. It's all just to pad the little bit of plot they chopped out so they can extend it into a long\, grueling cash in.The worst part is\, i could have probably stomached it\, maybe\, if they intended to make it a two part deal\, but now I'm hearing three episodes? four? FIVE? At $60 a whack! Not only is this practice a horrific trend in the industry\, costly for the average gamer\, but it also completely drains the overall experience of enjoyment. Nothing like playing through a fifth of the story and waiting four months to a year for the next chapter to come out to help you lose interest entirely.If you're going to prey on my nostalgia\, at least do it right.I have a feeling this one will be on sale quick\, so maybe just wait until then. Better yet\, wait a year or so until the 'Complete Edition' comes out\, and at least then you'll get the whole game and only get stung for full price once\, not to mention pick up all the overpriced dlc they no doubt have planned for this title.… Expand"

As other reviewers have said; it seems kinda padded rather than expansive.Midgar is not very \""open\"". The environments do well to represent scale in most places and are also often relatively reminiscent of the original PSX BG art. However at the same time they feel quite claustral\, meandering\, cardboard-like and bland. The familiar XIII corridor syndrome is alive and kicking\, just not as horrifically.The end-result was a sort of \""guided tour\"" of Midgar\, environments that didn't cohesively fit together to make up the city in a physical sense. It seems at odds with the larger Midgar that Square were going for.From the get-go the opening cinematics show the hustle and bustle of Midgar's streets. That's just not there; instead it's a hollow shell with limited exploration; it feels like a movie studio back-lot to me at least.It does do a fair amount right and there's some fantastic portions of the game; mainly chapter nine - however it's wildly inconsistent. It feels like every other chapter drops the ball. A fair amount of the dialogue sounded like it was written to fill gaps and\, to me at least\, drama lacked impact more often than not.It also seemed to bounce from realising the original game perfectly at some points; other times it felt like a generic RPG with a VII skin - then there was an odd touch of Kingdom Hearts. A few tropes such as ghosts (akin to heartless)\, melodramatic side-characters and KH-like level design in places made it seem like it was having an identity crisis. Some might enjoy this aspect of KHness but for me\, it felt out of place and unwelcome.I have enjoyed it insofar it's been satisfying to play most of the time. Though I grew frustrated the more I played and by the end I was angry with the cheap changes they made - it was a bit like the Game of Thrones finale; yet worse in that it screwed up beyond forgiveness in its final moments. Chances are many fans will enjoy this game more than I did and I am a little jelly of that. If you played it and liked it then I'm happy for you.I still think Square could have done better though; I'm hoping successive parts are stronger and more consistent. I'd like to see meaningful side-quests that don't feel like an after-thought\, story execution that doesn't seem oddly paced or padded with 'much ado about nothing' moments and consistent environments that don't feel like I'm on a movie-studio back-lot tour with \""this way\"" signs. However the main thing is the extent to which the story has been sodomized - it's too late now and all I can do is my best to ignore Nomura's terrible edits.One big concern - which I think many are wondering - is that this is a very small portion of the original game and that makes me wonder just how many parts it will be divided in to. As each part will likely be a full-priced game I'm hoping they don't repeat these same mistakes in the next parts and don't give us a good-yet-inconsistent expanded chunk of the original each time\, five times over. I'm really hoping part two is twice as big for that reason.On a side note\, I've seen many comments about the soundtrack... I actually quite liked it myself. It didn't do some tracks justice but for the most part it was fun to listen to.… Expand"

Their character arcs unfold way betterThe lower user scores on here are ridiculous. This game doesn't receive the hate/low score it's getting\, at all! I'll give my reasons why I rated it a 9/10 down under.First of all: The story. I thought it was good! You get to know Cloud\, Tifa\, Barret and Aerith better than the original game (of course\, modern technology and cutscenes help a lot). Their character arcs unfold way better than before. Even the side characters like Jessie\, Biggs\, Wedge get more fleshed out and I'm really liking it. They're giving you reasons for caring for them. Now\, the rest of the story: I don't mind the new addition called the Whispers (or Watchers of Fate)\, they're making sure everything in this part of the remake is faithfully recreated (for about 90% at least). I think it's also good that they show Shinra is a bad guy\, less subtle than before\, but it works. The ending is controversial\, but I for one am very curious where they will be going from here! A 1:1 remake would be less interesting.Second\, the graphics. They're really pretty for the most of the time\, but at times you suddenly get superlow textures (like the doors in Cloud's appartment block). Character models look amazing\, they're really detailled. NPCs not so much\, but that's doesn't disturb me. Another point is far-away backgrounds that don't look all too good\, you can definitely see that it's a 2D \""photo\"".Third\, the gameplay. At first I thought it would be a FFXV/Kingdom Hearts like action RPG\, but I was glad to feel that it's not the same at all. In my opinion\, this battle system requires a lot more strategy than in the old game (where you could mostly bash X to win). It's a mix between attacking manually and inputting commands (Spells\, Items\, ...). While attacking with Square\, you generate ATB. Once you fill out an ATB bar\, you can use a spell\, item or ability (some abilities need 2 ATB's). Materia are about the same\, and you've got some interesting ones to choose from in this remake. Summons are handled like FFXII and cannot always be used. As in FFXII\, you can summon them in (mostly boss fights) and they will fight alongside you while you can give them commands with your ATB gauges. You can see a bar slowly chipping away and at the end they will unleash their wellknown attacks (hellfire\, diamond dust\, ...). Most of the summons\, you'll have to fight to win their materia and I really liked those fights!Lastly I'm just going to say: DO NOT listen to the 0 scores\, they're just people who are review bombing this game\, hoping that it gets a bad user score. I don't know  why people like them would not want other people to enjoy the game\, it's incredibely egocentric\, egoistic and sad.… Expand"

And the fact that professional critics have given it a 60\, you know\, 15 worse than the motocross and Yu-Gi-Oh games is absurd.TL:DR - This game is a masterpiece. If you played the first one\, this is how you imagined it in your head as a child\, but real and in front of you. If you've never played it\, this is a great start point for the series. Either way a must-buy for any gamer.Ok\, so now with that said\, they've taken a game from an era which would be difficult to translate into a modern gaming experience and done so beautifully. The combat is action-RPG\, but if you don't like that you can switch it off. There are a ton of side quests which I was genuinely worried about up front\, but 1) they are optional and 2) serve to get you more deeply invested with the people and teammates you have. You know\, so you feel for them on a deeper level than a collection of sprites\, in case anything bad were to happen to them. Even here\, each quest ties into the next\, what would seem to be a fetch quest advances 3 quests at once. At one point 5 quests hinged on each other. There is real care\, thought and attention that has gone into each decision.The characters look gorgeous\, subtle decisions in their models\, scars\, gear\, all has been a painstaking labour of love. The combat is challenging but beautifully balanced. Never fought a trash mob during my first playthrough. Always hard\, but rewarding. And the enemies look great. They managed to make the house look good. Nuff said.The music is incredible\, blending and remixing original scores to hit you right in the feels if you played the first one. It is possibly my favourite thing about the game\, the score and Nubuo Uematsu sent me back to being a child immediately\, sometimes on the first bar\, and rekindled the feelings that I had all over again. The depth to the customisation\, both of weapons and materia give no weapon junk status. It's a decision that allows you to balance your loadout before each encounter if need be\, or pick a favourite and stick with it. The game's battle intel system actually helps you get better as you go.Finally\, the added bits to the story. I was a fan. I know others may not be. But in my eyes\, it helped to give me a deeper level of relationship with the characters in whom I am supposed to care. It made some more human\, more vulnerable\, while others gained more depth than just their character model's curves. I can see some feeling that it's \""not THEIR (insert character here)\"" but I tell you what\, it worked for me\, and I suspect far more people. Yes\, it is a part one of more to come\, but I'd rather have them commit to something now\, which forces the continued development\, than to wait 5-10 more years for something which is continuously pushed back. I'm grateful for what I have\, because it's brilliant. I can't wait for the next instalment.This game is a triumph. 23 years of waiting had me constantly smiling and my overriding feeling was \""I can't believe I'm actually playing this\"". This has easily taken to top spot on my greatest games of all time\, just for the ambition of pulling off this project at the tail end of a console's life and giving a high note for the machine before moving on to the next one.… Expand"

I can't believe how much people gobble giving this game 10 and 9 but you can see that the negative review are actually more prevalent in the 'useful' view of the silent majority.First thing first\, an argument that have been made that need to be debunked right now. This game cannot be judge as a standalone game. If it could\, it would be named FFXVI\, episode 1\, and would have received a solid 7 or even 8 from me. But it's not\, his name is FF7 remake\, and was marketed as a remake of FF7\, a game existing for more than 20 years\, that millions of people played and still have a massive community of players and modders. Giving a review while ignoring the original game and without comparison is absolutely disingenuous.  Now\, let's go over the reviewGraphics 9/10This is\, without a doubt\, the greatest strength of FF7RE. From the modern look of characters to the modernization of the 240p backgrounds of original FF7\, the game is gorgeous. The engine and photo-realism are stunning\, to the point that my only way sometime to separate actual cinematics from pre-scripted in game events was when Cloud sword and other characters weapon goes back to default. Without this detail\, I wouldn't have been able to see the differences.More over\, the facial expression of the characters give life to the emotions the original FF7 was lacking into transmitting to us. Where the original polygon had only one facial expression and the polygons of Barret had to do a pirouette with the polygons of Marlene to try to transmit the familial love between the two\, a 10 seconds scene of Barret and Marlene give way more information about how soft Barret actually is. Of course the voice acting play as much but will be mentioned later in musics and ambiance.I can also now see how Hojo can be the actual father of Sephiroth and the kind of guy that attract beautiful women when he take a day off at Costa del Sol instead of the creepy crawly scientist that should give his father card to Vincent.My only negative about this is that the engine generic asset taken directly from FF15 give me  once in a while a sore eye when I see them.Gameplay 4/10This is\, with the story\, the most divisive point concerning the remake. If this game was a standalone\, I would give a 6 or 7. It's a direct follow up in the evolution of rpg combat system square have in his FF  since the beginning. From turn-based\, to ATB based\, to going more and more toward action rpg akin to a beat them all.But it's not a standalone\, it's a remake\, was marketed as a remake\, and must be judged as such. What me and most of the fans of FF7 i was talking with on the FF7.fr forum were expected was a return to the source\, a modernized version of the original atb system\, a tactical turn-based rpg where you heavily prepare your party to face opposition in a turned base system. Instead we got FF15 combat system moderately modified with a skin applied over. One of my friend sentence resumed very well the situation : I like FF7\, FF12 13 15 and kingdom heart too. But if I want to play an action rpg\, I play FF15 and KH\, not FF7. I am not launching a play of FF7 for that.Some people will say there is a turn-based mode but it's only workable with grunts and basics enemies\, not bosses\, because of what I am going to describe.The game work on a mix between a beat them all with apparent numbers and an action rpg. You control one character at a time that are the main target of enemies. While you are doing basic actions like attacking\, moving and dodging\, an atb bar load letting you use actions like objects\, special attacks and magic in exchange for one or two atb bars. The system seems effective and simple\, enjoyable to play. But here begin the problems:Most ATB actions have a long build up that is constantly cut by enemies attacks\, making you miss that action\, from specials attacks to basics magics and items. Some of you seems to think this is a good thing\, forcing you to learn enemy pattern to know when you can and cannot use these actions... I am sorry\, when did I begin to play Dark soul in my FF ?More over\, You must switch between characters in battle to make them do any other actions than the basics given above. The IA don't do these by default and there isn't any way to set that... Are you kidding me? This kind of feature exist in FF since FF12 with the gambit system\, since 2006\, almost 15 years\, or even 2002 if you take other Square games like the original KH.Even worse\, the concept of player character being main target id done as a way to balance the game but the IA is absolute dumb in the move and dodge part. It constantly put the characters in the way of the most harmful attacks and begin a game of trying to make them survive said attacks instead of a fight.Outside of fight gameplay\, the outside of it is padded with useless side quests that can all be resumed by 'go found the slightly more stronger monster.'… Expand"

Playing this will NOT guarantee a similar experience as playing the original because the tone and main themes are completely different from the original.Pros:-What's actually faithfully recreated from the original game\, in a vacuum\, is pretty good. Any FF7 fan will get a goofy smile from the small detals like Barret engaging a shinra worker on the train back home\, or the cutscene with Cloud's mom.-When they decide to play the arranges of the original themes\, they are amazing. The soundtrack feels incredible when it hits the spot.-The character designs mostly (with the exception of Rufus\, Heidegger\, and few else) translate well to modern 3D\, these characters look the same.-The battle system\, while flawed and unbalanced\, is fun and engaging.-The visual fidelity of the character models and particle effects is really good.-Some of the actual content they expanded with\, is great\, and I could see it as a part of the original title\, albeit with a little bit of rework on the dialogue and tone (Jessie's sidequest to meet her parents\, the renewed Wall Market\, the section to nerf the Airbuster...)Cons:-The tone\, pacing\, and content of this game are all over the place\, and it's not like story changes are unwelcomed\, but they're not appreciated when they're so out of place like these. The whispers of whatever and this much Sephiroth jerking do not belong in this game. Sephiroth has lost all his menace and threatening presence since he appears stalking Cloud every half and hour and this poorly executed \""fate\"" theme completely undermines the emphasis the original title did on the gritty setting and the inmediacy\, inevitability and impact of somoene close to you dying. Every time the whispers appear on screen\, I swear I get brain damage. The last chapter really cranks things up to  eleven and then some to an uncomfortable and unbelonging degree. A mess.-This game is padded beyond belief\, every small plot nuance takes an hour to progress because every mindless and meaningless story beat has been made into 1h corridors or 2h dungeons. Most of the new content is meaningless fetchquests about killing rats\, rescuing kids and cats. These do not belong in FF7. You can not fully explore midgar\, and the side content is not meaningfull. Literally lied to the players.-Unfortunately the original soundtrack makes for less than half the screen time\, and the new pieces are all but memorable. If some of these tunes were supposed to be arrangements of the original ones\, I'm sorry but they're so strangely recreated I couldn't even recognize them. This lack of cohesiveness truly hurts Nobuo's signature motif style of soundtrack design\, and by not playing the songs over and over the beats fly over your head. I honestly cannot believe they did such a good rendition of the boss battle theme from the original game to NOT use it except for one fight.-These characters look the same\, but they sure do not feel the same. When the scenes are reenacted\, sure\, but the dialogue is inconsistent because they don't feel like themselves in most of the new dialogue. It's like watching a hollywood adaptation of a movie you like\, you know what's from the book and what's not.-The battle system after Don Corneo's mansion takes a nose dive\, 80% of the regular encounters have super armor and makes every encounter incredibly tedious\, while suddenly bosses are easy in comparison because you're starting to get too jacked up. It doesn't feel like casting an spell and getting interrupted should deplete your MP and ATB bar either\, makes the combat drag even longer since you rely more heavily on using spells on the second half of the game and getting interrupted and losing your initiative and having to spend more ethers just to kill the sewer turtles is a pain in the ass.-There are texture streaming glitches and the texture quality is REALLY low. Dialogues and cutscenes take entire seconds to trigger\, and the game softlocked to me twice during my playthrough. Rough\, technically speaking… Expand"

I enjoyed every single minute of my playthrough and every time I reached a new high\, the game tops itself once again!The gameplay is surprisingly innovative and extremely fun. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed gameplay as much this. There's enough here for veterans of the series who can ignore the fact this is no longer turn base and new players who are after something fancy & new. In my opinion this was the best way to compliment the epic set piece of the overall experience. I won't go too much into the story due to spoilers but there is definitely enough to satisfy old timers of FF7 and enough new elements to get you excited for the future of the series. For me it was an absolute rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish.There are three things that make the game for me. The boss fights\, the music and the world building. The boss fights are now amazing setpieces but very combat focused and involving. There are jaw dropping spectacles that do the original proud and then some. There wasn't one I didn't enjoy and it leaves much hope for future bosses of FF7. The world building is second to none and for me this gave games such as even the Witcher 3 a run for their money with how much is here to investigate. The music is incredibly placed\, introduces new soundtracks which are epic. Each piece compliments the scene perfectly\, battles feel epic\, running around towns has never sounded as good and the nostalgia will bring tears to your eyes. I clocked in at 35-40 hours on my first playthrough and I am now on my second playthrough. There is definitely replayability here and more than enough for your moneys worth. Texture quality has issues which sometime take you back a few years\, there could have been a harder difficulty from the start to ensure you enjoy the combat for a lengthier period of time and the side quests at times can be lacking in quality although the world building mixed in with these make up for it every time. These are minor gripes and things which hopefully Square will fix in time and in no way detract from my overall score but I can see this being a criticism from reviewers. Overall please buy this game\, you will not be disappointed if you go into this with fresh eyes but if you are also ready to go on a nostalgic ride of a lifetime. It is a FULL GAME and if you are unhappy about the episodic release then I ask you this question. Would you be happier with a watered down\, disappointing and empty 50 hour full FF7 original experience or do you want to be patient and wait to play a potential 100-200 hour masterpiece of a story start to finish. Personally I back Square 100% in the decision they made here\, here's to the next one guys and thank you again\, 23 years later in making me fall back in love with this game all over again.… Expand"

Although the combat is a nice change\, I can't help but feel like they didn't really know what they were trying to go for. On the one hand\, they set up the combat to be fast-paced\, where you instinctively button mash to try and pull off the combos\, while at the same time\, they punish you for doing so because you can't block or dodge in the middle of a combat animation. Games with combat systems like these\, usually make it possible for you to interrupt your attack animation to block or dodge. There were so many instances where I could see an attack coming and held down the block button. But because the attack animation was still resetting\, my character took the full brunt of the blow.Critiques & Suggestions:BlockingAn easy fix for the blocking issue\, as mentioned earlier\, is to simply allow an interrupt for the combat animation. Other games with similar combat systems such as Batman\, Spiderman\, Witcher 3\, and Shadow of Mordor have shown how this system can be put in place to make the combat more seamless.DodgingAnother is that they need to either add I-frames to dodge or make enemy attacks physics-based. It was almost comical seeing enemies who were the size of tanks or small buildings making 90-degree turns while charging at you because you dodged a millisecond too early. If you dodge and don't fully get out of their path\, I get it you get hit. But if you clearly are no longer in their way\, and this behemoth going about 80 mph suddenly makes a 90-degree turn to still hit you. Then that just raises an eyebrow.InterruptsPlayer interrupts need to be massively toned down as well. It's annoyingly easy to disrupt the player and cancel your spell. This is especially made worse by the aggro system the game currently has in place. As it stands\, the enemy simply goes pop goes the player\, making playing ranged characters a chore more than anything else. It boils down to you\, kiting the enemy as they relentlessly hound you and ignore the rest of your party.Limit BreaksLimit Breaks should have priority over everything so that enemies can't just walk out of it while being hit. The way some enemies can sonic the hedgehog to and fro is also super annoying. Oddly enough\, your attacks are physics-based. If you swing and miss\, you swing and miss. The enemy\, on the other hand\, as I mentioned earlier\, does not have this limitation.ATB metersThe ATB meters should have been for Abilities\, and that's it. You already have MP and the cast time to balance Spells\, and you've got money and limited quantity to balance Items.All the system really made me do was run in circles through the last fourth of the game\, so I could charge my meter at all.ItemsThis is tied in with the ATB system critique. Towards the middle and end of the game\, some items simply become obsolete. There is very little reason to waste an ATB charge and use a Potion that only heals you for 350 hp when you can simply cast a healing spell. A traditional item menu would have made things more seamless\, as well allowed you more utility in being able to use the items to heal up party members in between fights.… Expand"
75846,FFVIIR,2020-04-13,4,"This game is the epitome of style over substance.For everything this game does well\, it gets overshadowed by staggering things that it does wrong. The way SE expanded some characters and gave them more development is then immediately followed by meaningless kill X amount of monsters side quests. Or a sequence involving a reactor that turns a short sequence from the original into a sprawling set piece chased with a new character and a fast paced boss fight that is then followed by a 30 minute sequence of walking to the next city with maybe 2 encounters (see combat for later problems with that) and \""character development that could have been established just as well without slamming the brakes on the pacing.Visually\, the game looks wonderful\, I'm not going to argue that. In fact\, the game looks so well made\, that I believe that a movie called Final Fantasy VII Reimagined would have been a more pleasant experience than this game. I will defend this by also pointing out that every meaningful fight and experience is pushed so hard to be a cinematic experience that they should have just crafted a cinematic experience.The sound is not my thing at all\, but for the most part is well composed. I don't enjoy jazz or modern takes on old video game music. The music from the original was the first game that spoke to me that music in a video game could be a well made thing. But I get that everything must be made modern lest there be money left on the table. The new compositions by Uematsu are also some of his worst compositions to date\, in my opinion\, and don't add anything of substance to the game.The combat system. Oh boy\, here we go. So\, the combat system is SE once again trying to redefine a concept that doesn't need redefinition in Square's titles\, but not taking the same missteps in formerly Enix made titles. For an example of this\, look to every Final Fantasy title since 10\, then compare that to every Dragon Quest title since....I suppose\, 1. On one side\, you have redefining every iteration\, sometimes successfully\, other times\, less so. Then on the other side a series who knows what it is\, stays true to that and continues to receive praise and enjoyment from it's fan base. So\, true to form\, SE decided once again to redefine combat for a Final Fantasy title. And...it works...except when it doesn't. This aspect is the one I had the most concern for up to release. I do not usually enjoy action rpg's so I went into FF7R expecting the story to carry me through a combat system I wasn't a fan of. The combat system is actually fun and enjoyable\, but there are caveats. The first caveat is that a battle is either over in milliseconds or is a sweeping epic encounter to last the ages. There is no just middle difficulty battles. The easier battles only draw out the already padded sequences which halt the pacing and the harder battles end up serving as a signpost that there will be much less content of interest past that point.The story is where the game completely bottoms out its score for me. I wasn't looking for a 1:1 story of the original\, but I didn't want something like this mess either. The original is still highly regarded to this day because it did so much right: character development\, sound\, gameplay\, story-telling (which includes pacing)\, it even subverted expectations before that was the cool thing to do. So\, what could be done with something so perfectly crafted? You can look at the result objectively\, see the tiny cracks and flaws that time has shown\, subtly repair those imperfections and improve the entire project through minor changes. Instead\, we got Nomura. And Nomura does things the Nomura way. This means we get ridiculous over the top villains (but not really\, cause friendship will save the day)\, we got convoluted plot lines designed to span over years and years of content with the pay-off usually amount to too little\, too late\, and we get his story that he wanted to make. What we got was NOT Final Fantasy 7 Remake\, what we got was Final Fantasy 7 Reimagined. Nomura's direction allowed the fundamentals of the game to exist\, but not when they would get in the way of the story he felt he needed to change the original in to.Final thoughts: Final Fantasy 7 Remake is an overproduced game that will appeal to fan boys in a similar vein that a jingling pair of keys will appeal to an infant. It's shiny and sparkly and new. It lacks any substance or reverence for the original story (not world\, there's a difference). This game will sell very well and will pave the road for canon spin-offs spanning multiple consoles and hand-helds and maybe in 15 more years\, the final part will come out where Sephiroth and Cloud join forces to prevent Aerith's death at the hands of the watchers because the black materia and the white materia can bring paradise to the planet if they're linked.… Expand"

Though some of the new elements might feel a bit confusing to a start\, they do add some quality to the story and freshens it up. The pacing of the story is great as well\, with some truly dramatic climaxes and more relaxed episodes. Square knows how to build the tension and when to release it to continously make the game interesting. However\, for the hardcore fan\, there might be some disappointments in the changes to the story.The characters are absolutely amazing and are spot on as modern interpretations.Barret\, Tifa and Aerith are well built with great voice acting and character models\, making every move feel authentic and real. Side characters are also fleshed out\, giving more purpose to their parts of the story and the villains are well introduced and have great acts within the game. Cloud as the main protagonist is great and their remake of him in a modern body is excellent.The gameplay is what we've always wanted.Since Final Fantasy X\, the FF series has changed gameplay and combat systems each iteration. Some for the better and some for the worse. However\, FF7R nails the gameplay perfectly. The combat is crisp\, elegant and hectic and is a perfect remake of the old turn-based combat. It truly feels like a Final Fantasy game and the abillity to take command of each character and their unique abillity is absolutely amazing. It's a new type of combat that I believe will be built upon\, and stolen.However\, other parts of the gameplay can be a bit lackluster. The side quests has for a long time been a weaker part of the FF-series and things like puzzles are more or less non-existent. More variety and challenges could have been added to spice up some of the longer pathways. Certain parts of the gameplay however are true fanservice acts from the old game and even though they might not be the best parts of the game\, it's lovely that Square are brave enough to keep the goofy parts in for the fans.A Final Fantasy game is always beautiful - isn't it?Final Fantasy has always had cutting edge graphics and FF7R is not an outlier. The character models are incredibly detailed\, Midgar is beautiful and the effects are mesmerizing during combat. However\, there are some sloppy detailed textures and in certain scenarios the character models lack proper lip-syncing and are rendered quite badly. This is mostly during non-essential gameplay such as sidequesting\, but I would still notice it each time. But during the most crucial cutscenes\, as my girlfriend stated it; \""this could be a badly made Disney-movie\"".Nobuo Uematsu is a genius - who knew? The music is\, to no surprise\, incredible. Remaking such classical tunes into orchestral masterpieces blended into the gameplay is fantastic. One of my biggest expectations for this game was the soundtrack\, and that definetly lives up to the expectations.Overall it's an amazing game and Square is truly onto something huge here. FF7R might not be what the truest FF7 fans want with the changes to the story\, but as an immense Final Fantasy fan that does not rate FF7 as the best\, it's exactly what I wanted. It's a great mix of fan service and new thinking\, and in my eyes a revolutionizing combat system. With the latest FF-games not being on-par with what Square previously have provided\, Final Fantasy VII Remake truly shines and gives hope for amazing future games from Square.… Expand"

Infiltrating Don Corneo's abode had me laughing at just how good it was.But the further the story progressed\, the harder did Nojima and Toriyama deviate from the original's story and developments. From introducing core villains\, whose presence was supposed to be felt as a looming dread\, without fully unveiling them yet\, far too early over additions of fate ghosts to a completely absurd\, rewritten ending that pulls everything into question while making it clear that no\, this is not a Remake\, but a reimagining\, a reboot\, with the publisher opening the next part up to being whatever they wish it to be (or is easier to produce than a faithful sequel)\, the so-called Remake is a massive letdown.I was ready to adore this game. Cautiously optimistic ever since they announced it\, being of the old guard that had been wishing for a faithful remake for a decade before the announcement dropped\, I wanted to love it. For a good amount of hours\, I actually did. It is a great shame that they decided to abandon the script in favor of Nojima's prime storytelling device (not to spoil things directly\, but if you look at a list of games he's written for on Wikipedia\, you'll be able to tell what most of them have in common...).The real tragedy of this first part of the \""remake\"" really is that they did nearly everything right for so much of the game. From adding sidequests to flesh out the Sector 7 slums and their inhabitants\, adding dialogue\, making a real show out of the Honey Bee manor\, speeding up some tedious parts while allowing further exploration in others. Graphically\, the game looks absolutely stunning and I am ready to consider the main cast here to be the definitive versions\, the best overall designed and authentic renditions. The music is for the most part incredibly well arranged from the original Uematsu tracks\, although the new tracks fall short on a stylistic level. Added characters and comedic relief work in the game's favor at the point they occur\, before everything comes tumbling down to crash and burn.It left me asking myself whether these changes were intended from the start\, or were taken as a get out of jail free option when Square Enix's executives realized just how expensive the full game would turn out being\, if they kept the same level of detail and interaction throughout all we remember from the original. It's almost like they put so much of their budget into the first half\, they couldn't possibly maintain this scope for future zones\, cities\, dungeons and the like. Abandoning the original makes sense on some level\, considering that\, especially when it comes with a sort of justification to do things differently with part 2. The problem is\, that none of these full rewrites are good. They're fanfic-level absurdities that fail to grasp what made the original beloved in the first place. It's as if they didn't truly understand why fans wanted a remake\, or what they expected of it. Maybe they figured that sales of Kingdom Hearts 3 indicated that people wanted more of that absurd type of modern Square Enix storytelling? I'm grasping at straws here\, trying to somehow understand what made this company throw one of their most highly valued and cherished title into the river to drown any future expectations.If I had Nojima's timey wimey powers vested within me\, I would like to turn back time to the moment that the relevant staff at Square Enix decided to make these fatal decisions\, and force them to defy fate. I wished this game nothing but success\, but this company has once again managed to disappoint and\, in a sense\, infuriate. My biggest fear is that the rewrites will tarnish the original's legacy\, especially for the newcomer audience that expected to hop into it with no prior experience. To them\, it'll feel very disjointed\, but probably cool due to the way it looks and plays. They won't be able to grasp what made the original a classic for the ages\, however.That's a shame.… Expand"

Each character feels unique and there is a lot of potential for different builds based on your materia choices.Fourth there are a lot of fun mini games\, a few extra bosses. Some of these extra bosses are unique to hard mode but I really enjoyed playing the game on a higher difficulty. The final boss in particular felt much more climactic as I was barely hanging on most of the time and won while being about one hit away from dying.Fifth the character models... you spend a lot of time looking at character models in any game and these are the best I've ever seen. The detail on the armor is insane. When you focus on a character's face you can see their eyes moving every so often too. Very impressive.Sixth the reverence shown for the original source material. You'll find so many references to the original game or spinoffs as well as every moment\, boss and enemy recreated in stunning detail. Some things were changed but not to any significant degree in my opinion. It's just so clear after picking apart as many details as I could... that the devs love the original ff7. There's just so much passion in this project.Seventh chapter select and hard mode. After you finish the game you unlock chapter select and this is so great for people who want to complete the game fully. If there's an optional boss you didn't assess or you want to go back and get an alternate cutscene then you don't need to replay the full game. Also hard mode offers a really nice challenge once you're max level :).There are a few flaws as well but nothing that hampered my enjoyment.1st some chapters feel padded. Without going into specifics there are areas in which you have to pull levers to open pathways to go open more levers to open up more pathways while you constantly get interrupted by enemies. Some sections of the game feel like they're wasting your time. This is probably the biggest issue the game has.2nd some boss fights can be frustrating. Even at max level with maxed out materia on normal difficulty there were times when I felt like a ragdoll getting thrown around\, constantly healing. It's not that I couldn't win. I rarely died. It's just that my attacks felt ineffective. This is largely down to not being able to change equipment or materia during a fight. I understand that this might make things easier but it can be frustrating to find yourself unable to exploit a boss' weakness because you don't have the right materia.3rd this game is not beginner friendly. For the first 90% of the game everything is going fine but with the last chapter in particular things go kind of insane. At first I wasn't a fan of the ending but after taking some time to digest it I'm way more positive on it. The last chapter starts throwing out references to the original ff7\, advent children\, crisis core and all kinds of stuff. The game really expects you to be familiar with this stuff. That kind of sucks for newcomers but actually picking apart the insane number of references was a lot of fun. I imagine if you're new to ff7 you'll be completely lost. I'd highly recommend the easy allies ff7 remake spoiler mode video for a very indepth breakdown of what the ending really means.As for what comes next I'm pretty excited. It looks like it'll be different from the original and I think i'm ok with that. However... I desperately need some of the original story beats to remain untouched. Corel town\, rocket town\, the golden saucer\, cosmo canyon.... I'm ok with changing the overall story but I need a lot of these amazing character moments to stay the same or mostly the same. The main reason I'm optimistic is the unbelievable reverence shown to the original source material. Every enemy\, boss and moment from the midgar section is here. The benches have the save symbol from the original game. Small details like rude having a clear shot on a character and missing on purpose... a reference to one line in the original game... It's just so clear that this game was made by people who adored the original ff7… Expand"

И отвратительный искусственный интеллект\, не ну серьезно порой они просто стоят и получают по морде. Чем хороша боевая система. Ну тем\, что она  предусмотрела ошибки 15 части и теперь магия не кладет весь ваш отряд. У вас есть от одного до 3 атб. В большинстве у вас будет 2 атб. Это очки действия. Они набираются во время боя и потом вы можете их использовать на предметы или магию\, или призыв эйдолонов.  Кроме этого у вас есть оружие и обычные комбинации ударов. У каждого персонажа свое оружие. Меч\, миниган\, жезл\, перчатки. По ходу игры вы найдете их вариации. С уклоном в какую-то сторону\, атака\, защита\, магия\, что-то среднее.  Комбинируя оружие и материю вы сможете атаковать стихиями\, лечить\, поднимать павших бойцов и все в таком духе.Почему я считаю что игра растянута? Ну это видно по локациям.

73700,FFVIIR,2020-05-12,5,"Speravo di poter scrivere una recensione positiva\, ma sarei falso con me stesso e con chi mi legge.Terminato il gioco\, il senso di soddisfazione era elevato. Ma\, esaurito l'effetto nostalgia\, ho ragionato su ciò a cui avevo giocato: un disastro.Detto questo\, provo ad analizzare il gioco in se:- Musica: salvo la colonna sonora. Su questo argomento\, nulla quaestio.- Grafica: protagonisti bellissimi\, ok\, ma tutto il resto? Esclusi i capitoli 1 e 16\, il resto è scarno. Texture slavate; texture che caricano in ritardissimo\, o neppure hanno la forza di caricare; ambientazioni prive della minima interattività; elementi degni di una PS2; sfondi panoramici dalla resa pessima (l'apice dell'orrido nel capitolo 15). Quindi\, tutti questi anni di attesa e di promesse\, per avere una grafica degna della PS3 (per essere gentili)?- Sistema di combattimento: lo salvo\, per gusto personale. La deriva action è interessante\, ma cozza con la mancanza di realismo tanto nella grafica\, quanto nella fisica di gioco. Una mancanza\, per esempio\, è l'ignoranza dei due membri non comandati direttamente: è impossibile impostare delle strategie. Si è sempre obbligati ad impartire ordini diretti. O svecchi bene\, o tanto vale conservare il metodo del 1997\, molto più ordinato.- Gameplay: Cloud NON SALTA. Siamo nel 2020 e una limitazione simile è inconcepibile. Nel capitolo 2\, anzichè saltare oltre l'auto che gli blocca la via\, il gioco ti forza a fare il giro di un palazzo\, per ritrovarti esattamente oltre l'auto che non hai potuto scavalcare. Ridicolo. E questo genere di situazioni si ripete costantemente. Ma voglio anche ricordare le innumerevoli scale\, scalette\, strettoie\, passaggi in cui ci si abbassa\, passaggi su paletti\, tutti rigorosamente indicati con freccette luminose (giusto per calarci nell'atmosfera...). Non basta il marcato backtracking tra missioni in cui hai nel gruppo prima un personaggio e poi altri\, NO\, devono pure farcire il gioco con questi piccoli elementi che nel minutaggio hanno fatto gola agli sviluppatori. E aggiungo anche le svariate \""passeggiate obbligatorie\""\, lentissime\, dietro al personaggio di turno che deve farti strada verso un determinato punto.- E qui ricollego subito il gameplay alla longevità: il gioco si compone di 15 ore di video e circa 25 ore di gameplay (Modalità Normale). Solo che in 25 ore sono comprese tutte le missioni secondarie\, tutte le azioni indicate nel punto precedente (come l'assenza del salto)\, e il tempo che si perderà dentro ai menù di gioco\, tra gestione delle materie e sviluppo delle armi. Ho finito la prima run raggiungendo il livello 40 con tutti i personaggi (su un massimo di 50 livelli di esperienza).S'era tanto parlato di una Midgar \""viva\"" ed estesa\, ma a conti fatti dell'affascinante città che vediamo nell'introduzione di gioco\, in game visiteremo quattro zone in croce\, lineari e basate su un pesante backtracking.Vorrei fare un parallelo col gioco originale\, visto che in sostanza sono le stesse zone (se escludiamo l'uscita per andare a trovare la madre di Jessie e il capitolo 15): se vuoi fare un remake esteso\, di un prologo che dura 4 ore\, devi aggiungere nuove zone visitabili...inventare qualcosa per farmi visitare quella bella cittadina viva vista nell'intro\, altrimenti è tutta aria fritta e mi gioco le 4 ore originali.- Infine\, la trama: hanno preso un gioco del 1997 e\, anzichè svecchiarlo e ripulirlo nei punti poco coerenti o poco chiari\, hanno demolito tutto in virtù di uno pseudo seguito di Advent Children.Nel prologo originale\, Sephiroth era un uomo leggendario\, circondato da un affascinante alone di mistero e lo avremmo visto solo in seguito. Nel remake\, te lo sbattono in faccia dal capitolo 2 fino al 18\, senza ritegno\, spiegando già tutto.I Numen (Whispers) devono vigilare sul corretto prosieguo delle vicende originali\, che portano alla salvezza del pianeta\, ma lo fanno solo quando fa comodo agli sviluppatori\, generando anche situazioni paradossali (e non mi riferisco a Zack).Il trio Biggs\, Wedge e Jessie era inutile nel 1997 ed è solo stata amplificata la loro inutilità\, per non parlare della macchietta Roche che\, probabilmente\, sfrutteranno nel prossimi episodi per continuare ad allungare il brodo inutilmente.Conclusioni: se non avessero speso tempo e denaro dietro ad una grafica pompatissima (che a conti fatti non abbiamo ricevuto)\, scendendo a compromessi avrebbero potuto benissimo realizzare tutto in un unico gioco. La prova palese della pigrizia di questo team\, mista all'incapacità di gestire un progetto\, è un gioco realizzato nel 2017 da un altro team della stessa azienda: Dragon Quest XI.Se cercate un gioco completo e realmente appassionante\, puntate su DQ\, perchè FF7R è un'operazione nostalgicamente spillasoldi.Hanno preso una briciola dell'originale e l'hanno espansa bagnandola nell'acqua...ma sempre una briciola resta.… Expand"

It was enjoyable but I wish they would adjust how aggro works. Enemies will almost immediately switch to target whoever you're controlling. However animations work and look great\, and the combat is easy to coordinate and follow.- 8/10 parts of the story are amazing. Barret crying after the collapse was incredible - he felt like a real person.Cons:- Graphics: Super low resolution textures can be seen everywhere. To make matters worse Nomura tried to make light of it while acknowledging it by stating \""Sorry everyone. The slums are so poor they couldn't afford better textures. Maybe next time.\"" That's a pretty lousy excuse for a AAA game.- In Game Healing: You have to heal out of combat in the most tedious way. Even holding L1 you have to go through each individual animation to heal. You spend quite a bit of time healing in this game. It should've been made somewhat faster outside of combat.- The second time you mount your motorcycle while leaving Shinra Tower\, the \""boss\"" mechanics are cumbersome. Nomura likes vehicle battles (Kingdom Hearts Gummi Ship)- Chadley is incredibly awkward and forced into the game. A child is forging materia while appearing everywhere throughout the game? Ok - it's a FF game. But he doesn't feel fleshed out or like he belongs. It was a character built to support a game mechanic and I wasn't really a fan.- The game was incredibly linear. Too Linear. I would be exploring paths and suddenly be unable to turn around or blocked off with immersion breaking cancel signs.- 9/10 if you see a bench you're about to have a boss battle. I thought this was too on the nose considering you can save the game - at any time. This con in particular is a nitpick of mine\, so it doesn't factor into my score.The biggest con:I understand the love and hate for this game. It was mostly well executed and well made. However fans had been pushing for 2 decades for essentially a remaster\, rather than a retelling by Nomura which is why this happened at all. They feel betrayed because this was marketed it as a remake. Had it been more forthright that this was a retelling with major plot alterations to come I think more people would have been much more accepting and likely waited to purchase. Or just a different title so that people knew they were getting 100% Nomura.I am ok with Nomura changing the story to add world building and to flesh out and realize characters more. Making slice of life scenes all of which weren't originally there. What I am not a fan of is taking an established property and claiming that this game that stands on the original story success is good because of the Nomura brand changes in the final 2 chapters. People are applauding those 8/10s of the game. The fans that are upset likely feel upset because every single story Nomura has ever touched coincidentally has the lowest overall metacritic scores in the entire franchise and for good reason. He is a notoriously convoluted story teller made glaringly apparent by the objectively poor story telling over the course of KH1 through KH3 - that isn't even debatable. Newcomers and some old fans are fine with the changes he made at the end because it's so minor in the grand scheme only in the first installment that it seems fresh. It is likely not going to be minor come future installments now that Nomura and the team can point to this ending as rationale for whatever they may have in mind. This is the setup for potentially massive changes so Nomura can tell \""his\"" story. Fans didn't want Nomura's story\, they wanted the FF7 story expanded and brought to life on modern consoles.I am still excited to see where these installments go. But I will be waiting much longer after release of the future installments to see if this all holds true. Fate ghosts/seeing the future/negating on screen deaths - those are typically hallmarks of poor writing. So I guess we'll see.… Expand"

74169,FFVIIR,2020-05-16,8,"My first playthrough on normal difficulty was fun\, touching and challenging for most of the time\, but there was always certain things that I was hoping to overlook when making a 2nd playthrough on hard mode\, for better or worst I do believe hard mode is the \""better\"" way of playing FF7R although those certain things that I was hoping to overlook were stronger also.As a general overviewMy first playthrough on normal difficulty was fun\, touching and challenging for most of the time\, but there was always certain things that I was hoping to overlook when making a 2nd playthrough on hard mode\, for better or worst I do believe hard mode is the \""better\"" way of playing FF7R although those certain things that I was hoping to overlook were stronger also.As a general overview I think FF7R is a good game\, great also but it certainly has its flaws\, my favorite aspect by far was the combat system\, similar to the one in XV but polished to the point that it truly feels challenging and fair\, at first I was trying to main a character and the game also gives you options to play like that but when the combat truly shines is when you play your party as if they were a unit\, is really mesmerizing to end a boss battle when everything clicked. Although the problem with the combat is that it feels that you don't fight as much as you like and this is where things get a little too rocky.My main problem with this remake is that its rhythm almost never manage to get a good balance between gameplay and cutscenes or even liberty to explore or things to do\, a typical hour in this game goes almost like this: watch a cutscene of several minutes\, advance some steps\, watch a little clip of your party discussing something\, advance some steps\, have 3 or 4 fights\, cutscene\, advancing\, etc. except for a few action driven chapters\, you're gameplay is always interrupted by a cutscene or a clumsy mini-game\, its difficult to grasp all the fighting mechanics when the game keeps you from fighting. Side-questing can be a good option when doing well... extra things\, however\, the catch is that there are just few side-quests for just a few chapters\, and when you finish them don't expect to do a lot more\, even the enemies doesn't seem to spawn after you clear them.The story is great\, if you know the original you know more or less how this goes\, the difference is that this time they added a lot of things and backstories to fill the runtime of 40 hours or so and at times it feels a little like they were padding and stretching things a little too much\, don't get me wrong tho'\, the characters are charming than ever and for the most part feel well scripted (aside from some notable localization choices but may is just me)\, but maybe cutting some content or making some scenes shorter certainly would do it better\, I didn't mind the padding that much on my first play-through but when kicking in the 2nd round\, I was skipping a lot of chunks of the game that certainly didn't add that much.Graphically\, the game is beautiful and it certainly does look like a final cycle PS4 game\, Midgar looks massive and full of life\, I love how things are quite different when is day or night\, even when is the same place\, more often than not I was fooled of what things were real time and what things don't\, in reality a lot of the things were real time\, no wonder how my PS4 sounded like a rocket.The music was a little mixed for me\, overall is good\, I'm not sure how difficult is to screw over the amazing original tunes to begin with\, but my problem with a lot of the songs is that they sound too \""Hollywood blockbuster\"" generic\, I do like some of the rearranged versions better than the original\, but when they pick the more active or battle theme ones they tend to sound a little tamed\, they're still good but not as much as the original source. Speaking of original source\, I highly recommend that you play this with the original Japanese audio\, every actor manages to capture the charm of all the cast\, they sound like they should be\, the dub cast\, I definitely stay away from that one\, it sounds too \""saturday cartoon show\"" for its own good.As my lasting impression\, even with its pretty noticeable flaws I do like where this is going\, I didn't like some of the narrative choices and there's a lot of room of improvement for the next chapter\, I know that this section on the original game was not exactly \""open world\"" but it hurts that you can only play like in FFXIII in a just one way corridor\, hope the next one gave us the freedom to explore and do whatever thing we feel to do. If you played the original and don't mind the gameplay shift\, most probably you'll like this game\, if you haven't played it\, I do recommend that you play the original first\, since this game expect that you know some of the story (similar to Rebuild of Evangelion). Overall I enjoyed my time with this game\, so I surely but not strongly recommend it\, I'm aware that maybe a lot of people prefer a cinematic experience over a gameplay experience so maybe this can be your cup of tea if you're more in the former group\, so give it a go.… Expand"

Too much *bad* padding immediately ensures that the main events lose strength.Some characters – both primary and secondary – are used so badly that plot and characterisations are diminished by them. Some characters exceeding screen time\, in particular\, extinguishes their charisma and ruins plot suspense. Others are simply annoying.With rare exceptions\, most of the (new) plot content is so cheap - both in writing and often in execution too - that becomes frankly embarrassing to witness. In many cases\, dialogues are cut short in an unnatural manner\, clearly only to artificially leave questions open. But the worst is when the plot embarrassingly tries so to trick the player in mistaking cheap content for deep.Gameplay. Combat aside\, the gameplay is so clunky it feels less advanced than 1997 - something I particularly felt in the motorcycle sections\, but exploration comes first. Walking around feels somehow even more linear than in the 1997 original. All areas are minimally modelled\, and the general perception is that the whole game is set in a series of long corridors.It is during the exploration phases that the padding assumes its worst form. Jumping over fences\, activating switches\, squeezing across passages... All environmental actions trigger an animation that can last from 2 to 10 seconds\, and you will see *a lot* of these.Finally\, puzzles are always bad\, for similar reasons. The whole experience is frustrating at best\, and depressing at worst.However\, I personally enjoyed the combat system\, although it poses questions on \""sustainability\"" of the power scaling. By the end of the game here you will be quite powerful by the original game's standards\, and it feels like they will need to \""downgrade\"" your skills in the next instalments in order to enable a proper growth.Music suffers from wildly alternating quality too\, the bad of which comes from some horrifying J-Pop/Techno-Dubstep new additions that simply ruin the atmosphere – to the point I've actually muted the speakers in some occasions. There are some excellent orchestral pieces\, often used wisely\, sometimes wasted on scenes that scream to be forgotten for their cheap content.So what saves this game from total oblivion?There is some stellar acting and good plot points in the middle of the cringey J-pop stuff - which sadly is not comparable to the greatness of the original.While it has been sometimes criticised\, I really enjoyed the fighting system\, and I think there is some objectively great work there. Alternating characters is fun\, and while when they are left alone their AI does just the bare minimum\, this actually drives you to keep alternating between them\, rather than lazily stick with one. The fighters are well differentiated.Despite little variety on mini-bosses\, enemies are well varied\, and bosses – with only few very bad exceptions – are simply stunning and fun to play against.… Expand"

74323,FFVIIR,2020-04-28,10,"I'm a hardcore Final Fantasy fan\, going back to the early 90's getting into the series back on the SNES. I've loved the original Final Fantasy VII\, through out the years\, it always remained as my top favorite game.And I can say\, as a hardcore fan... This game. Was. Amazing! I loved the entire experience with this game!\nI'm going to get into all of the good and the bads about the game:I'm a hardcore Final Fantasy fan\, going back to the early 90's getting into the series back on the SNES. I've loved the original Final Fantasy VII\, through out the years\, it always remained as my top favorite game.And I can say\, as a hardcore fan... This game. Was. Amazing! I loved the entire experience with this game!I'm going to get into all of the good and the bads about the game:Good:First\, and most important. The story. The story was an amazing retelling. It stayed pretty true to the original with the major events\, while adding a huge extra portion of Midgar. I loved getting to further explore and see Midgar. This was a good touch.Probably the best part of the story\, was playing again a second time\, and understanding the reasoning behind the ghost figures. Every time the story slightly derailed from the original game\, they showed up pushing events in order to put it back on proper course. I'm surprised so many players from the original FFVII didn't catch this\, and were confused by the ghost.For Example. Cloud was let go from helping Barrett at the next reactor\, and instead Jessie was to take his spot. But the ghost show up and injure Jessie\, forcing Cloud back into the group\, like the original.Later in Chapter 17: Hojo begins to tell Cloud he is not soldier\, which was to early for him to find out. Then the ghost appear separating Hojo from Cloud.Every time events changed\, they were there to set it back on proper course. It was a really good touch.Materia Set up: I loved how they kept the Materia the same. It wouldn't be FFVII without the integrated materia into the weapons. However\, now they added something else even better! The Weapon level sphere grid tree! This was incredible! I love being given free range to build a character the way I like. Being able to gain more power ups. And this was an amazing addition to the game! Lets keep the weapon level trees!Dialog: The voice acting was on point. And the dialog itself was really good. I was laughing with a few of the lines in the game. They really nailed the personalities of the characters.Cutscenes: The cut scenes looked amazing. This game was beautiful. It was a real treat on the eyes. I only with it had more cutscenes to sit back and watch. There was a lot of times they had a small 5 second dialog cut-scene and I wish they were longer. I wanted more interaction between the characters!And of course the music. I've always went back to the old school FFVII sound track to listen to the music. It helps me relax. The music in the remake is just as good and relaxing!The bad: (Even though I love this game! There are some things I wish were different.)Not enough early grinding spots: It's not an old school RPG unless you do tons of grinding! Well until you beat the game and get chapter select to return to spots. There isn't a whole lot of early game grinding for AP. There are a select few spots early on. But until you get to the arena\, there isn't too much.Possibly to keep you from getting too over powers before a certain spot. After you finish the game and get chapter select it's much easier to return to certain spots to grind out that extra AP.Too Linear: This is only a minor problem. But a lot of chapters is the game are very linear and lack the open world free roam that FFVII had. I loved in chapter 14 it opened up a semi-free roam potion to go between sectors 5 and 6. And as this game only takes part in Midgar\, that is good enough. But I am hoping that Part 2\, once you enter the real world\, brings on the true free roam. Giving us the entire world as our playground\, much like the old school game!*Also\, you need to keep in the Fort Condor mini game battle for part 1! I loved that mini game! *This was a long review. But strongly expresses all my viewpoints and love for this game!… Expand"

The world looks amazing running round / midgar/ sector 5/ wall market is stunning and so much fun as a fan\, how they have brought what used to b a few hand drawn screens to life in 3d is epic\, and omg this game looks amazing\, on ps4 pro it runs beautifully i havent noticed any slowdown/ frame drops\, very nice use of hdr as well\, i dont know if it all runs in native 4k you would need to check digital foundry's review for that\, the game does follow a story path but is no where near as linear as ff13\, there are multiple opportunities to run around doing typical jrpg side quests etc\, and the game will warn you multiple times are you sure you want to go on\, i have heard people say they ran through the story in 25-30 hours\, me doing majority side quest things etc my first play time was 45-50 hours\, and there is alot left i want to go back and do\, you level up like in all jrpgs\, you also level materia up like in the original with AP and u can learn abilities from weapons and level up the weapons as well with a crystarium style grid\, it all works fine. Ok and i left the best to last the music/ soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece\, it is literally one of the best game soundtracks ever from new stuff to 'remakes' multiple times i just sat there with the menu open just to sit and listen its unbelievably good! If you are a fan of the original and worried about the battle system I would say check out the demo\, if you know you will be fine with combat and are a fan just get it you will love it\, ignore the trolls let them go back to the 10th or whatever cod with no changes they pay 60 for.........Graphics/ Visuals 10/10Music 100/10 ...:P 10/10Storyline 10/10Playability 10/1010!… Expand"

However there are deviations\, and without delving into spoilers\, I will say I found them to be good for the most part.

However there are deviations\, and without delving into spoilers\, I will say I found them to be good for the most part. What they did is actually genius\, but I can’t say why without ruining the point of playing the game and experiencing it yourself. Suffice it to say Square Enix is aware of what they’re doing by changing things\, and they’re aware of what their audience thinks. Despite what angery fan boyes online are saying\, they didn’t kingdom hearts this game. But\, what they did do is extremely clever\, and I am very much looking forward to the next game\, which is coming\, it says so in the credits.Navigation: Like FF13\, this game can be rather linear\, but unlike FF13\, the combat isn’t “which autopilot will win this fight”\, and there are multiple times during the story where it opens up and you can do side quests / grind on monsters to level up material\, etc. FF13 didn’t give you this option until the last third of the game which imo was a huge mistake. The paths are less linear\, and you are rewarded for taking your time to explore paths to find treasure. Occasionally\, areas are clearly structured to pad out the time you play the game\, but this only bothered me a handful of times (forcing you to walk for a period of time during a more interactive scene for example) and at it’s worst\, wasn’t that bad. I appreciated SE being responsive to the fact that this game being just midgar needed to be expanded on to be worth people’s money.Combat: This might be the best part of this game. It’s a mix of action and strategy. You have enough options as each character that each battle feels good and distinct. You have to block\, dodge\, attack\, and monitor your ATB gauge which is what allows you to use items\, magic\, summons\, and your better abilities. Combat gets better as you get better. You can mostly **** your way through the first bombing run\, but pretty soon\, you need to actually learn how to do it to not get rocked\, and it’s impressively fleshed out.On normal difficulty\, this game isn’t easy\, and requires you to use all of the tools it gives you. Beating the game unlocks chapter select and hard mode\, allowing you to replay previous sections with your current weapons material and gear.Weapons: Each weapon has it’s own special Triangle attack\, and if you use it enough you can learn it permanently (think ff9) and then use it with other weapons\, expanding your abilities as time goes on. Even cooler\, each weapon has it’s own skill tree. You get SP as you level up\, and can upgrade the number of material slots\, damage you do with physical or magic attacks\, defense\, as well as other cool effects. You can reset the weapon skill trees to change how you play as you get more SP as much as you want. This gives combat and character development a lot of extra wiggle room. You can test out a build\, and if it sucks\, go reset it for a trivial amount of gil\, and try again.Materia: The material options are pretty robust\, most of what you expect to be there is there\, and there are tons of new material\, which you earn by doing intel missions. e.g. use the sense material on X number of enemies\, perform Action Y\, Z number of times. It rewards you for exploring the battle system to the fullest\, which is just good game design.Music: The music is incredible\, a lot of expansion on the original tracks but most of them are so good. The music is dynamic as **** boss battles will have music amp up or slow down based on the action and as you get closer to killing the boss it gets increasingly amped up. I got goose bumps so much I lost count of how often it happened.Final thoughts: I think Square Enix intends for this to be supplemental to\, but not replacing the original. It’s clear they plan to make significant changes to the arcs of many characters moving forward\, and they reference things that happened in the original to an extent that makes me think we’re in for a similar but different story for this series. TBH\, I’m ok with that. Sephiroth is still trying to destroy humanity\, Shinra is still Shinra\, all the characters are still themselves\, it’s still FF7. But it’s not a shot for shot remake\, and the next games in this series will likely deviate from the original story and plot in ways that some will take issue with. I’ve beaten FF7 original probably over a dozen times now. It’s my favorite game\, I’m as a big a fanboy as they come\, and I am onboard the remake train. It’s so good. My final playtime before doing Hard mode / chapter select stuff was 40 hours\, I did most of the optional stuff before finishing it\, but I think there is more than enough content to warrant getting this game. It really is very good.… Expand"

This release surely isn't perfect\, but sets the stage for something truly memorable down the line.Disclaimer: I have played a bit of FF7 in the past but I'm not a FF7 purist\, so you won't find here any criticisms like \""oh they changed that story bit and it's awful\"" etc. It's just the opinion of a first-timer (kind of).This remake focuses on the Midgar portion of the original game\, which originally lasted a few hours\, thus Square Enix have largely expanded the content\, the story\, the character arcs\, introduced tons of boss fights\, etc. in order to make it last 40 hours.I warn fans that some story bits of the original have been changed a bit (ignoring the new content\, the overall plot is 95% the same as the original up until the end of the Midgar portion) and Square Enix hint that the story will change even more in the sequels\, for better or worse. Treat it like a parallel universe relative to the original 1997 game. This remake is not just the same game with modern graphics\, and that's what I appreciate most in remakes of this kind. At least Square Enix take creative chances and don't play it safe. Had it been a straight retelling of the original's story\, it'd have been boring for everyone who's read about FF7's story\, and even hardcore FF7 fans would have yawned at it.The story is pretty straight-forward but also heavily cryptic (thanks to it having to be continued in the sequels)\, so there is no clear resolution\, just a cliff-hanger. With the expanded scope\, nearly every character is fleshed out and has the chance to shine a bit. Cloud is a seemingly emotionless man of few words with a mysterious past\, Tifa is a childhood friend of Cloud's\, Aerith is a carefree florist with plenty of mystery surrounding her\, the trio of Jessie/Wedge/Biggs make for some nice chat\, and Barret is a father genuinely concerned about the planet and his daughter Marlene. Of course there couldn't be a FF7 game without Sephiroth\, but he's more of a guest star and isn't fleshed out at all. Red XIII is introduced very late into the game and has no real time to shine\, but he should be fleshed out in the sequels.Gameplay is the most important feature of any game and I can say Final Fantasy VII Remake has one of the best battle systems I have played on any JRPG. Gone are the battle screen transitions\, you simply engage any foe encountered on the environment. Battles flow like a mix of real-time action and turn-based specials. You can move\, dodge\, execute basic attacks and guard in real time\, while items/spells/special moves can be used only after the ATB bar has been filled. Same for limit breaks or summons\, whose respective bars are slowly filled during prolongued battles. I just wish the combat was more challenging\, Normal Difficulty is just too easy for me. I never had to use de-buffs or status ailment curatives\, and I only lost and continued 3 times.Graphics are great overall. The use of Unreal Engine 4 brings about weird artefacts in some places later in the game (particularly inside the Shinra building with all their reflective surfaces)\, but main characters are rendered and animated beautifully. While there are a few CGI videos every now and then\, at least 90% of the cinematics are rendered in real-time and are the most impressive of the generation so far. Performance is rock-solid 30 fps both during battle and real-time cinematics\, even when the screen is filled with plenty of special effects.The soundtrack is mostly the same as the original score (obviously re-recorded) with a few new tracks or songs. The sound effects are great\, as is most of the voice acting. Unfortunately Barret's growling voice tone is annoying\, while voice actor James Horan (Skull Face in MGSV) is not the right choice for voicing President Shinra.But not everything is perfect with Final Fantasy VII Remake. There are some technical issues which detract from the game's overall high quality. As of posting\, there is no patch for the game fixing any of the following issues (which are minor complaints\, nothing major). 1st\, quite often textures either pop-in right in front of the camera\, or fail to load the high-res version and remain in a low-res\, jagged mess. 2nd\, the overabundance of narrow corridors and \""hold Triangle button\"" sections\, which are invisible loading screens actually. 3rd\, the level design is linear and almost on-rails\, reminding me of the dreadful FF13.All in all\, Final Fantasy VII Remake is a virtually flawless game in what it attempts to do. It's not easy for Square Enix to develop this remake while also meeting and exceeding fans' expectations. I definitely had a good time playing through the game and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone.… Expand"
74780,FFVIIR,2020-04-12,10,An absolutely perfect Remake!This is more than I hoped for. This is one of the few games in my life I’ve played that deserves a 10/10. It has kept me the whole way through.
74792,FFVIIR,2020-04-13,10,"So\, so so much better than I anticipated\, even if there is some padding and with the surprise ending\, I expected a tremendous disaster like another FFXV but they managed to go another direction with it."
74808,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,9,"There are so many things about this game that not only met my high expectations but went even beyond what I thought they could achieve. I am a big fan of Final Fantasy but for  15 years the series has disappointed me. In so many ways this game is a return to form\, a return to the core of what I consider the elements that make the Final Fantasy series so special. The world building\, the story telling\, the characters and the spectacle. I would say that at least 90% of this game was exactly what I wanted it to be. It provides a truly current gen recreation of an amazing experience that could never fully be expressed when it was created over 20 years ago. For the 10% that wasn't exactly what I was hoping for\, it isn't bad necessarily but it is a departure that left me somewhat disappointed and fearful of what may or may not come next.Despite any disappointment I had though\, this is without question one of my favorite  games of this generation and in many ways\, one of the most impressive games ever made. I haven't been this immersed in a game since Breath of the Wild. Like Breath of the Wild\, the ending was what I consider the low point of the experience\, but in a very different way. The ending is not bad\, it is just a departure from the original game whether or not that departure will turn out to be better or worse in the long run\, I won't be able to say until the story has reached its conclusion.Gameplay is definitely a vast improvement over the original. Traversal is still pretty limited\, compared to other action games\, but there is a lot more interesting traversal than there was in the original\, though it is all still scripted. The combat system is one of the best action RPG systems I have ever experienced. Each character has a very distinct move set\, with wide array of unique abilities that are unlocked by obtaining new weapons. Materia returns and is pretty similar to the original game but the way it is used is well balanced and interesting. Customizing your abilities and character builds is very simple and intuitive\, I never felt like I had to spend too much time in menus and when I did it was interesting enough. The only thing about combat that I really disliked compared to the original was how summoning works. I really didn't like that summoning is only available in specific battles and you have limited control of when it can be used. You can also only use 1 summoning per battle. I really liked summon rushing in some of the other games. Being able to use multiple summons in a battle was super fun for over killing enemies and creating massive spectacles.The Story is\, for the most part\, is a big step up over the original Midgar section. Each aspect of the plot is explained in greater detail with greater context. It shows so much more of what is going on it the world and plants the seeds of many things that are yet to come in a way that is more believable. For example\, Shinra seems like a far bigger organization with far more complex plans. We get to see their propaganda machine in full swing and see how each department is operating. AVALANCHE is also fleshed out as a group as being far more than simply Barret's team. Each boss is also presented with far greater context and new ones are added which enrich the story more. For example\, Air Buster is shown being assembled before you ever get to fight it. The story is full of moments that show the scale of Midgar the how it functions. Wutai is fleshed out more etc. There are only a couple complaints I have with the story. One big complaint I have with the story\, is Sephiroth\, the way he was handled was with far less subtly and far less dramatic payoff. In the original\, you don't get to see Sephiroth until after leaving Midgar\, and that is how I believe it should have been left. Sephiroth's reveal was so gradual\, he was such a presence of terror. The first experience you get of Sephiroth is seeing his sword sticking out of a dead President Shinra on his desk. Up until that moment\, President Shinra seemed like the biggest threat. That moment was far less interesting in the Remake. The other big problem I had was the overall ending\, the breaking of the timeline and the resurrection of certain characters. The fact that so many characters live really weakened the sense of loss that the characters should all have experienced upon leaving Midgar.With the exception of the ending. The Characters are handled perfectly\, they are iconic\, but more than just iconic they have substance\, and appeal. The Remake captures exactly what I loved about these characters in the original but also expands upon it in leaps and bounds. I felt like I got to know every single character in a far more meaningful way than I did in the original. I also felt that the characters got to know each other in more meaningful ways. All of the characters get moments to connect\, grow and work together in combinations that I never expected.… Expand"

Graphical bugs relating to texture pops; photorealistic characters walking into rooms with blurry rectangles as doors...it was jarring. The more I played\, the less I noticed though.I beat the game and reached the New Game Plus screen just under 40 hours\, at 39 hours 52 minutes and 43 seconds.I have played the original game. I was 10 when it released\, so the majority of my memories are from watching my brother. But\, on my own\, I did get as far as Disc 3. I never bothered to finish it over all of these years\, but I know the story from years of reading up on it and watching the spin-off media\, be it the movie\, anime or games (Crisis Core\, Dirge of Cerberus.)With all of that out of the way...WOW!I loved this game so much.Gameplay: 10/10The hybrid system that they created for combat is one of the best I've ever played with. Merging real-time combat with the ATB system for Abilities\, Spells and Items plays so well. You don't have to worry about button-mapping and remembering to press L1/R1 or L2/R2 to get access to certain abilities. There's a simple menu to pull up in a fantastic Tactical slowdown/pause. Brilliant!Wandering around was great too. Sure\, Cloud is bound to the ground unlike his namesake\, but the situational bounding/ducking/slipping areas were all you need to traverse the areas presented.I encountered a few annoyances of interacting with the environment\, like maybe I was too close to a lever to pull it and had to re-position\, or too far away to trigger a conversation\, but nothing to ruin my enjoyment.Overall\, the feel of running around as Cloud\, traveling the parts of Midgar that were available through different chapters\, encountering monsters and Shinra goons to fight – it was all exhilarating. I had a ton of fun with this game.Graphics: 10/10I said it above: photorealistic characters walking into rooms with blurry rectangles as doors is jarring. It's a texture-loading issue\, though\, and it can be fixed with a patch. Surprisingly\, SE has been silent on that. But maybe that's just the Japanese dev way?Aside from the texture-loading making some environments look wonky\, everything else looks amazing! The updates to the characters is fantastic. Jessie is dreamy! Biggs looks and sounds like Charlie Sheen. Wedge looks a bit anime-fat-guyish\, but that's fine. Tifa looks strong and capable\, and it seems like they might have reduced her bust to what it could have been\, making her look more believable (in the age of breast and butt implants.) Barrett looks great with his burly barrel chest taking up the screen as he barked insults. Aerith is beautiful - we never really saw much\, if any\, of her in Advent Children\, so there wasn't really an updated graphics model for her like there was for some of the others.The game is gorgeous! I found myself stopping to admire what scenery there was under the plate. We know the engine can support amazing graphics\, so there's no doubting how beautiful the world will look in part 2.Writing: 9.5/10The characters were amazingly done. They fleshed out every character. Cloud is no longer the mumbling\, nearly-silent protagonist. Tifa steals your heart (I did have her with the Steal materia also.) Jessie\, Biggs and Wedge come close to being liked more than the core party members.The story is expanded\, reworked and revisited. There’s a lot of the same\, what one would expect from something labeled “remake” – but there’s also a lot new and some different. The new stuff benefited the game without question – most of it is introducing new characters\, but also just world building and fleshing out some gaps between the original’s big moments.The different stuff is where a lot of people are complaining. But I’m not. I like remixes\, especially of things that I like the originals of. Nothing significant has changed in the story – all of the same basic beats are there. There’s just some tweaks that make you question where they’re going with it. Some of the tweaks wander into the new category\, and that’s an interesting path they’re taking. I’m intrigued to follow!Music: 10/10Wow! Wow! Wow! There’s not a single track I wouldn’t jam to outside of the game.Hitting the credits and hearing “Hollow” with the lyrics\, after having heard the music/melody in different parts of the game\, was such an experience! It hit me in the feels for sure.Replayability: 7/10Not much incentive to replay unless you’re a collector or completionist. But it’s an RPG\, that’s not surprising. Collectibles\, side quests/odd jobs\, maxing out the characters and making different choices to influence what dresses characters wear at certain times are all what are left for me to do. Hard mode might be fun too. Maybe.… Expand"

No there is no time-traveling in this remake\, just a lot of foreshadowing\, lemme explain. Also spoilers for the OG and the remake.\nFF7 has two major revelations in the later half of the main game\, one is usuallyThere seems to be a lot of confusion about the story.For everyone claiming this game to be a sequel/reboot/whatever\, i guess you never actually understood the original FF7. No there is no time-traveling in this remake\, just a lot of foreshadowing\, lemme explain. Also spoilers for the OG and the remake.FF7 has two major revelations in the later half of the main game\, one is usually overlooked because the other one is so much more obvious. So lets talk about the lesser known one.When the party finally reaches the northern crater for the first time\, it is revealed that up until this point of the story\, Sephiroth has not really been involved. The real Sephiroth has been trapped anside the lifestream\, and it was really JENOVA\, that has done everything prior.That is the reason why everytime Sephiroth showed up\, you fought a part of JENOVA. Seph didn't kill Shinra\, he didn't kill the Midgard Zolom (Midgardsormr) and he did not kill Aerith\, that was all JENOVA.So no\, you do not fight Sephiroth in the finale of the remake\, not really. It is revealed that it was just JENOVA using another one of the clones to do her biding\, something that she has done many times prior\, and also in the original.Also the spectres are revealed to be the will of the planet. And who is sitting in the lifestream\, Sephiroth and JENOVA. Even in the original it was brought up that both Seph and JENOVA have been using the lifestream for their shenanigans. So it actually made sense that the spectres where doing conflicting things\, both protecting and attacking. Barret was not supposed to die in the Shinra HQ so the planet fixed it. So in a metaphorical way. we fought JENOVAs control over the lifestream in the end.A little theory of mine\, is that the specres are the souls of the deceased Cetra. They have been said to be really in touch with Gaia\, and it would make sense that they have such an interest in Aerith\, one of their own\, and also how Sephiroth\, who is an artificial Cetra\, is able to manipulate them.But until we get further confirmation in later parts of the remake. it is only speculation.Anyway. some more things about the remake.The pacing has been upgraded wonderfully\, after every major dungeon-ish\, and action heavy piece\, there is a chapter that slows down\, and let's you embrace the city of Midgar and her people. You were never able to dive this deep into Midgar and her daily life.The soundtrack has been remade wonderfully by both Uematsu himself\, and the composer he himself chose to do the rest of it.The combat system is absolutely fantastic\, Battles are usually quick\, but require you to get more tactical still. If you just buttonmash your way through the fights you will get koed very quickly\, at least on the Standard difficulty. It's only Barret that can get a little bit repetetive\, if you main him a lot.Visual presentation is top notch\, everything has been upgraded in such a high matter\, this might just be the best looking game on the PS4. Facial expressions do vary a little bit\, and some random NPCs mouth movements do look a bit off sometimes\, showing they clearly put more focus on the main and side cast. Speaking of which.They actually managed to turn Jesse\, Biggs and Wedge into ACTUAL characters. In the og they were the 3 guys from the first mission that got squished later. In the remake\, they got so much personality\, backstory\, and screentime\, it made me actually sad to see them still getting killed\, and i was genuinly happy that Wedge\, and in the ending scene even Biggs made it out alive. It made Jesse still dying even more bitter\, as she would've been a wonderful dating choice for the Gold Saucer date in Part 2.It doesn't seem like the dating mechanics of the OG returned\, but that has to be seen in later parts.The plot has been expanded majorly\, and aside from a few little (and one not so little) things\, it isa big enhancement. I feel the story is a bit frontloaded\, showing a lot of scenes that happen muchfurther in the story\, through Clouds JENOVA induced hallucinations.These have been made much more severe\, and happen far more frequently in this remakecompared to the originals one time\, when Tifa met Cloud in Midgar prior to the OGs start\,IMO there's a little bit too much Sephiroth in this Part 1\, it kinda took away from the mystery of the original only really seeing the results of his actions but never him actually doing it\, but fornewcomers there is plenty of things happening that leave you in head-scratching confusion\,waiting to be explained later in the story of future parts.The big issues to be had are the side quests\, which are just generic RPG things to do\, which just aren't up to snuff anymore with games like Witcher 3 showing how to do proper sidequests right.The other things is how much the story setpieces are limited in exploration. If the game doesn't want you to explore\, then it just won't let you. There is also nothing to be found then.… Expand"

75013,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,5,"This is a review from an honest FF7 fan who played the original back in 1997. I will breakdown this review into sections as this game needs a thorough breakdown.Graphics - Inconsistent at best. As soon as you get to Sector 5 you get a beautiful 240p shot of the slums and it looks so out of place. You might think it is a one off but from this point forward the game gets littered with low resolution textures and NPC's everywhere. Some would rival the PS2. Main character models and particle effects look excellent. Environments look great at times and true to source but often a low res back drop ruins the moment or just flat out bad textures.Soundtrack - Good but not great. Some of the new arrangements of songs fail to hit the mark and are often inconsistently drowned out by sounds or the volume is too low. I never got hit with the same feelings as I did with the original.Combat - Fun for a bit but gets tiresome later on. Friendly AI more often than not does nothing. You need to attack to get ATB up but you can fill yours 3 times over before an AI gets one section done. The game has a lock on target system that does not truly lock on. You will often end up jumping across the stage attacking something you didn't want to. So don't even try moving the camera around for a better view in battle. Camera angle is very inconsistent and jumpy. Battles go from too easy to overly frustrating very quickly.Voice Acting/Dialogue - I see this praised a lot but I found it atrocious for the most part. The delay when speaking to an NPC or interacting with a character has a very unnatural pause as both people do a robotic animation to face each other. Most conversations just sound cheesy and unnatural and that isn't to say the main dialogue doesn't suffer from this too. Gestures often do not match what characters are saying which is immersion ruining IMO. Barrett humming the victory fanfare makes me want to rip my ears off.Gameplay - Horrible pacing. From slow walk conversation\, to crouch walking\, to keeping balance over wide planks\, or to the ever dreaded squeezing/shimmying between things. (These are obviously to hide loading sequences.) Side quests are nothing more than useless fetch quests to stretch the game. Yes they are optional but I always try to do these in FF games. These are the worst in FF history. Every small area is stretched out to repeating corridors and key fetching. These are boring and repetitive. Fighting the same boss twice just shows a lack of awareness and creativity from Square Enix. The bike sections are long and exciting for all but 2 minutes. Yes we all loved the motorcycle escape in the original but I don't think anyone enjoyed the 1 hour you spend on the damn bike over 2 sequences in this one repeating through the same environment over and over and over. I had to restart my game in 2 sections due to crashing from bugs. Once in the ducts in Shinra Tower and once in the final boss fights. Unacceptable for 2 parts you have to go through. Loved starting that fight back from the beginning.Story - Why did you do it Square Enix? You sold and advertised this game as a faithful remake but instead this game went full Nomura and now we are stuck looking forward to this? This is closer to a sequel. The new characters are forgettable at best (Roche\, Marle\, Leslie etc) and I really don't think we needed a trip to visit Jessie's parents. That whole part served 0 purpose like many other filler parts. The secret lab under Sector 7 where you fight hundreds of alien experiment things? Is this a joke? Does anyone even care what Shinra is doing at this point considering we get Sephiroth one hour into this and every hour after? One of the most epic moments in gaming history is believing Shinra is the big bad but waking up in the cell trying to break Aerith out and following the trail of blood to find Shinra with a sword through him stuck to his desk. Instead we fail at hitting Sephiroth and end up doing a boring Hojo lab grind? I won't even get into the ending because it is self explanatory. Dementors that only make sense to people who played the original like what is this crap?Personally I feel betrayed and hate the direction they are taking with this. There is already way too much FF7 content as is. Please bring FF16 before another part of this crap. I will not be buying the remaining parts of this. Count me out.… Expand"

75084,FFVIIR,2020-05-07,7,"I regularly check Metacritic for 'user' reviews of movies and games but I never made an account before\, did it just to review this game. To put it up front I am a big FF7 fan but did not mind the episodic release\, the real-time gameplay\, or even moderate changes to the plot. In some ways it is two games put into one\, a fantastic 10/10 and a 5/10 which makes you wonder why anyone wouldI regularly check Metacritic for 'user' reviews of movies and games but I never made an account before\, did it just to review this game. To put it up front I am a big FF7 fan but did not mind the episodic release\, the real-time gameplay\, or even moderate changes to the plot. In some ways it is two games put into one\, a fantastic 10/10 and a 5/10 which makes you wonder why anyone would spend the money and time developing it.Originally I was going to give this game a 8. Most of the game was fantastic\, the story\, the gameplay\, the world building\, how old characters and places were fleshed out. It went down from a 10 to a 8 because there were several directorial decisions and new additions that just seemed odd and the pacing slowed down way too much at a few parts\, at least 20% of the game\, when it should have picked to match the drama of the moment (I actually didn't mind the sidequests much though they were relatively uninteresting). Likewise\, the excessive inclusion of a character from the original that had very little presence at all in Midgar only weakened them with respect to the plot and compromised the Midgar/Shinra drama without bringing much to the table. While most everyone knows how the story plays out\, a truly great story like that of FF7 keeps its magic with every replay/retelling and so I think it was a mistake to retcon them back into the story so early. It also went down to an 8 because of some of the graphical texturing and 2D pre-rendered background drops looked pretty bad\, the Midgar plates in the distance looked pixelated to me (on PS4 Pro)\, which was only made more jarring when compared to the amazingly crafted character models in the center of the screen.  Why is there no blood\, at least in cut-scenes? Games can get Teen rating and still have some blood in them\, they had talks of transexuality and basically a not so subtle allusion to climaxing during fellatio\, but no blood?  Also\, the music was sometimes great\, but some of the remixes felt off\, and I was disappointed that the Wall Market music was reserved only for the Highway Ruin but instead got something lame in its place.From a nostalgia/story perspective\, as the 1997 FF7 is one of my favorite games and I played it maybe 5 times\, I thought most of the game respected and innovated with respect to the original in great ways. However\, the last 10% of the game starts to differ in significant and significantly weaker ways and it climaxes in an utter garbage finale that makes no sense not only in the context of the FF7 universe but\, even nostalgia aside\, would make no sense in an FF7 Reboot that would have consisted of the plot up to that point. Even a particularly striking difference in FF7R from the original that occurs throughout could have had compelling meaning if tied into some of original's motifs like J----_ or the Lifesteam... but no\, it culminates into a garbage finale that on its own would be given a 3/10\, just garnering some points for moderate visual spectacle and some fun gameplay. Many have pointed to Nomura and Kingdom Hearts nonsense for that\, and I really liked KH1 and think it's much better than the FF7R ending. Some people says it justifies the creators taking the game in a new direction\, but that's not what most people wanted (is it even legal to brand it as a remake then?) and the Remake already differed in noticeable ways before the Finale without the ridiculous deus-ex-machina moment as a justification. Much of the game just awed me\, and some of the additions and embellishments made future events\, that I already knew were coming\, all the more compelling. A great example are some of the Avalanche characters\, their fleshing-out moved me all the more since I knew what was coming... or at least thought I did... In fact I did not mind saving (or not saving after being ghosted...) one of them\, but then they shouldn't have  had an earlier cutscene for them... Likewise\, the expiration of the other members is done in a really hokey and drawn out way (example of bad pacing)\, should have followed the original where they are still talking and breathing till the very moment\, well\, where it would be impossible for them to. Well\, the ending completely upends all of that\, so\, I actually don't know if they're dead or alive at the moment. The ending left me feeling utterly drained and disappointed... it's been days since then and I am still not over it....Kitase claimed in an interview that the rest of FF7R will still follow the original FF7 story... I hope so\, and quite frankly it would be AOK with me if the rest of the episodes just completely ignored the final ending of FF7R-1 and ret-retconned the Big Bad to a more mysterious\, distant position.  I am tempted to give it a 6 because the ending is so bad\, poor pacing and childish directorial decisions\, significant graphics drops and poor music remixes\, but I think an 7 is more fair given that 3/4 of the game was amazing.… Expand"

This adds a unique challenge and you don't want to be caught with low HP and no ATB. You can block and dodge\, but both of those actions are sketchy in their execution. The dodge has no invulnerability frames\, and the block only works against some moves... And some moves just seem to eat through either one.One issue I haven't seen any review mention so far is how the enemies don't play fair. They seem to have infinite MP (thus the ability to cast spells as many times as they want) and don't even seem to have an ATB bar either\, as I've seen them spam moves over and over. I noticed it early on\, but later in the game it becomes a blatant crutch that the AI relies on to be challenging.  Considering that the original game had fair fights\, I can't say I'm too thrilled about it. Barret originally had a move to specifically eat MP\, which was a legit strategy against certain bosses and harder enemies\, now totally gone as enemies don't even have that stat to worry about.The story sometimes follows the original perfectly\, word for word even\, so it was clear they did their research\, and at its best I was happily reliving my childhood seeing these characters interact. Most of the new content and dialogue is good as well\, and apart from the ridiculous usage of autistic anime sighs/groans\, is fairly natural too.The original Midgar section\, which acted as the games defacto tutorial\, took about 3 hours to beat\, and this game extends that to beyond 30\, so you'd imagine they added a ton of new content. They did and didn't. You'll find some totally new quests and of course a litany of generic fetch quests as side missions\, but the new story beats are usually good. That said though\, the developers took several areas from the original and extended them\, sometimes to upwards of an hour.This isn't always bad\, I enjoyed seeing the extended train graveyard\, but for the most part the 'extended areas' are a slew of similar encounters\, mundane puzzles\, and copy-paste level design. While it didn't ruin my experience\, some of these areas grew very tiresome.The game is excessively linear as well\, you never get to travel off the beaten path\, and while you do get to see some beautiful sights\, most of the game takes place in the least polished area of the game\, the slums.The slums have issues\, from low resolution textures\, to NPC's repeating their spoken lines over and over\, to meaningless side quests\, and so-on. I had no interest in exploring the side content because it felt like they chose the worst area of the game to open up. Meanwhile the upper plate areas are lovingly crafted with insane attention to detail\, but are 1-off areas you never visit again.My joy for this remake was a rollercoaster ride of positive experiences hampered only a few times by frustrating encounters or padded areas\, but the ending was probably my absolute least favorite moment and has me worried about the rest of the series.I don't want to spoil major story beats\, but I can't really avoid it... You fight literal destiny or literal meta commentary\, depending on how you want to look at it. This entire final segment just bombshells the game out of nowhere\, makes absolutely no sense\, adds nothing of value to the story or lore\, and I'm sure stirred up the exact controversy Square Enix wanted. It's important to consider that this is literally the beginning of our heroes journey here\, and we've already killed destiny?  It's so random and offputting to me. The game was throwing out our antagonist left and right too\, ignoring the originals subtlety and slow build of mystery\, instead opting for a \""HEY THIS IS THE BAD GUY\, OKAY?! THIS DUDE YOU KEEP SEEING IS THE BAD GUY\, RIGHT HERE\, YEAH. HIM. THAT GUY\""The ending is a slap in the face in contrast to the original subtlety\, which if you didn't know\, Sephiroth\, our antagonist\, had only been hinted at and barely seen in passing by the point the remake decides to end at.I'm conflicted. It's a good game\, no doubt\, with a few flaws that did hamper my experience\, and an ending that straight triggered me\, but if the future of this series is to revive the original\, with a few changes\, I'm still game. I enjoyed my ride through Midgar\, and if they can remake most of the towns and areas to the same level of detail\, I'll have a good time.… Expand"

There is no going around that but giving it 10 out of 10 should not be what either old or new fans do because it is not perfect as a remake nor stand-alone game\, yet the ones giving 10s are complaining about review bombing while they do the reverse. People are being hyperbolic on both sides and the claim of \""a true fan\"" is given far to much attention as it is never about being \""true fan\"" so I will give my fair assessment. Throwing Purist or newbie around is not creative but I understand the need to vent emotion.What I am seeing here is a very passionate fanbase because the game does a lot of things right. This game means a lot to a lot of people and almost always because of either selective nostalgia (both sides suffer from this whether it is seeing old characters again or not staying true to combat mechanics or something else) or the simple fact that this is a Square (Enix) title. Those that praise it too much should realize this because blaming bad reviews on nostalgia is just as bad as praising because of wanting more content regardless of form. It is also unfair to blame the marketing because many people from both sides avoided trailers and discussion to try and not spoil their experience. Hopes were shattered for some (as is always the case) and people that want to drown out critical voices\, hostile or not\, need to check their own level of investment and reactions. I will keep this spoiler-free but there will be mentions in a non-specific way.Great things:++ Main character realization is amazing\, banter is mostly good\, the dialogue feels like real characters\, so much more body language\, great use of small scenes being longer+ Characters looking very much alive\, even if some mouth movement was very strange+ Expanded maps and areas\, feels like a real place most of the time\, it has nice views but sometimes horrible textures but these are seldom a problem+ New combat that feels fluid and works great\, it is a pleasure working with the combat even though it has many flaws.Moderate* The music is good but not so special people think. Personally I find gripes with the music being too bombastic and orchestral at times and adding new weird music seems unnecessary (hip the Chocobo\, no more needed to be said). It is wrong to expect the music to be in tune with the old game but that game had simple gentle music and such exists in this game but blends out because sometimes it feels like I am sitting in a theater. It fitted Advent Children better because that was a movie. The music also reminds me of FF XIII sometimes.* The padding is sometimes just a get through. Many mention certain areas and it is easy to understand why they doBad- Camera\, the camera was very annoying at times and while it never destroyed the game it was frustrating how it worked when it seems it should be something simple. A simple \""restore\"" button would be nice.--- The new story elements that are tied to specific spoilers. Now before a tantrum is cast this is actually something that even those that give 10 or nines actually states in their reviews so don't freak out at this mention. There is also no truth in that selective parts of media can't be judged on their own or give an impact on the review score. Many praise the game for being something new but this is like Terminator dark fate all over again with the difference that this calls itself a remake while Terminator dark fate was Terminator dark fate. There is much to be said and it cannot be explained away by positive reviews as \""it is a remake so expect X\"" nor discarded as \""didn't like it\"" by negative ones. People are entitled to their opinions but people are too eager to engage and thus we have another media war (like with so many titles these days). The truth is that this is not faithful to the originals story and will not be in future titles\, regardless of how much people praise it or try to twist the obvious lore breaking stuff. This does not mean it is bad but from a story perspective\, it is baffling. It would be the equivalent of rewriting the new testament so that Jesus survives. This both as the lore alteration and that there is a cult following. It is a remake alright but people should understand what this means for different people and respect each other.People of all ages and old or new fans can and many will like this game a great deal but this game seems to have started a fan war where people just blame each other rather than thinking. The game is very similar to Kingdom hearts on many levels and that is off-putting for many people because FF VII never had that kind of stuff in it regardless of what people want. It also feels as even the game knows when they deviate with voice acting shifting in tone and characters themselves being indifferent or overreacting.… Expand"

Luckily\, the things they do right\, are phenomenal.PROs:Incredible battle system. Hands down\, one of the best RPG battle systems I have ever played. Intelligent combination of tactics based old school command based rpg mechanics\, mixed with well designed fluid action combat. Very few flaws\, very well designed\, and very well implemented with the rpg mechanis.Rpg mechanics are phenomenal. They translated the excellent materia design of the original and just improved and iterated. Weapons upgrading and providing the character with unique abilities is an excellent and polished addition.Music. This game has one of the best soundtracks of all time and it's a love letter to another one of the best soundtracks of all time (the original FF7).Characters: probably some of the best realized characters I have seen in an rpg. From the phenomenal acting\, to visual design\, to writing\, to perfect animations and subtle facial animations\, to story beats\, to everything related to characters. Just truly masterclass. Even if everything else was horrible\, this game is MADE on the strengths of these characters.Setting/Story: The setting is an excellent presentation of the iconic and wonderful setting of FF7 and the parts they do right with the story\, they do REALLY right. The places they expand on with characters is phenomenally done and the moments they preserve from the original are masterclass. It serves as testament of how good the original story was in the first place. And the way it was expanded was just wonderful.... except...CONS:Level design. As per usual with final fantasy games\, some of the worst level design I could possibly conceive of in otherwise competently designed game. Serviceable at best\, but not really the point of the game (-1 point).Quality. Whether it's texture issues\, random low points in quest design\, lip syncing\, or random imbalanced audio design\, this game can get kind a rocky (-0.5 points).Story: For everything they do so so so RIGHT with this game\, they have beats in this story that are so amateurish and bad\, that it is shocking that this game is made by the same people. I am not a purist by any means. I celebrate the changes in this game in comparison to the original. But there are additions and changes to the original story that absolutely gut and rob the game of it's initial impact and meaning on a criminal level. Without getting into spoilers\, there are specific moments throughout the game that are just inexplicably done in a way that is decidedly worse\, especially in the latter act. From the way they handle the villain\, to the removal of subtlety of the original\, to the complete gutting of iconic moments\, it's just cringe at times what they do with the story. I can't separate this game from the fact that i have played the original. Perhaps these moments can still work for new fans\, but with the original as context\, they just completely miss the tone and theme and soul of the original in a way that seems it's purposefully hack. Leaning towards things that are bad cliches and moving away from moments that were truly inspired in the original. It's difficult to describe\, without spoiling and going into detail\, and it is a point that could be argued for and against. Specific decisions\, made with this game\, could be debated for hours. I think a major way to sum up my feelings on things they have done\, is that they have somewhat diminished and in some cases outright robbed the story of consequence\, horror\, and subtlety.Nowhere more can the above criticism be explored\, than the underlying B-plot that serves as the core of this game throughout the entirety of it. I won't get into details\, but this B-plot is the most controversial thing about this game. It's why you see so many zeros\, and to put it simply\, it represents a major departure from the spirit and identity of the original\, for something a bit more akin to a marvel movie. Some people make a comparison to kingdom hearts\, but I feel that this is a surface level comparison. I WILL say\, that once you mull over the story and play through a second time\, it's obvious that they thought this story through and it all pieces together properly. But does that make it good writing? No. It's hack\, over the top\, tonally inconsistent\, it's silly\, it's not a good direction for the game/franchise\, and it willfully misses the point of the original for an arbitrary reason. It makes the story convoluted for new fans and it subverts not just the audience\, but its own themes. It's clear they have no interest in producing a remake\, but it's also clear they don't have a good idea for a future story (-0.5 points)… Expand"

I thought\, what could possibly go wrong? Considering the impeccable source material\, crisp graphics and action packed battle system.It would turn out to be the greatest disappointment in video game history.FF7R is lazy game design at its finest. It may appear as grandeur and ambitious\, but i assure you its not. Almost every map of the game is a thin corridor with only two directions: backward and forward. Actually\, strike that. Most of the time you are not allowed to go back to visit previous areas in FF7R. Not that you wanted to anyways because all the environments are unappealing and there is little incentive to explore\, unless you want to commit to stereotypical JRPG quests (rescue kittens\, kill some rats yay!) but more on that later.You may think I'm nit picking\, but really the core of an RPG is exploration and to be able to walk around freely. Unfortunately\, FF7R holds your hand so tight its not much different than playing a FPS like say Modern Warfare. You may also say\, \""well the original game's Midgar section was fairly linear.\"" Yes\, but at least you could walk in more than 2 directions! Often times\, the game forces you to walk in slow motion\, or slowly crouch under an object or along a tight space\, which is to mask the loading times. This completely ruins the games pace\, something that Square Enix started doing since Tomb Raider 2012. Thus\, traversing the corridors of ugly rubble is not only boring but extremely tedious.Keep in mind that FF7R is about 100gb\, the same size as Red Dead Redemption 2. However\, the latter is a sprawling open world with endless opportunities and freedom. My question is\, where did all the FF7R data go?The best parts of the game\, is when they stick to source material. The Sector 1 bombing mission\, the church meeting with Aerith or the Sector 7 plate collapse are all well done pieces. As soon as the game deviates from the original's path it gets bad quickly. One of the worst sections is the chapter with Roche. He is a repulsive annoying prick that served no purpose. Classic ridiculously directed action from Nomura side. There is a lot of needless filler that was obviously put in to make the longer and less enjoyable\, such as Hojo's lab or the Leslie mission. The NPCs are stereotypical\, out of place and you can only overhear their conversations. Many times through the game\, the party says \""you wont be able to go back\, are you sure you want to continue?\"" Seriously\, when did this happen in the original? Why does the game decide what you can do and where you can go? Furthermore\, the great majority of the sidequests are petty and outright stupid. It was fully possible for the developers to go further in the story than Midgar and have a more well balanced and focused experience. Regretfully\, Nomura and his team chose to make this project a cash grab and have it in installments.The music and the battle system are the brightest part of the remake\, but it can also be a hit and miss. Wall market replaced the funky tune of \""The Oppressed\"" with some generic jazz music. Fighting is fun\, but the environments were so dull that it took out all the enjoyment.The nail in the coffin was the ending. Just wow\, talk about going off the rails. Without going into detail\, I can just say that it was utterly abysmal and didnt feel like Final Fantasy\, it felt more Kingdom Hearts-esque. I cringed through the whole part and lamented the fact that Square Enix had defiled one of the most beloved RPGs of all time. The implications of the ending quickly eradicated all the excitement about the potential of any sequels. Certainly\, the argument could be made that a remake must be different\, but this is out of proportion. A good remake (i.e RE2) sticks to the original and builds upon what made it so great. Playing FF7R is like watching a bad filler arc in an anime waiting for it to get back to the main storyline.This game could have been a masterpiece but in my opinion it was developed by a mediocre team marred by mediocre results (FF13 + spinoffs\, FF15\, KH3). The failure is a testament of the downward spiral of the company. There hasnt really been a good Final Fantasy since XII and I sadly dont see it getting any better. Playing FF7R felt like playing the second half of FF15 with FF7 characters. Critics are mesmerized by the surface without looking underneath and they are too obscured by the love of the original. Also\, theres the fact for many that bad game design is not an issue as long as it is wrapped in a neat package with impressive graphics and a cinematic story\, as we have seen with Uncharted and the Last of Us. But I decided to be honest and see it for what it is.The greatest disappointment in video game history.… Expand"

It wasn'tThis is my first\, and most likely\, my last review.  I have never felt the need to ever review any game (largely because I think most reviews are either paid\, ridiculously biased\, or bare-bone garbage pushed out for money).  Yet due to the circumstance of this game\, I felt like I needed to.  Please ignore my lack of articulation.I remember playing FF7 for the first time.  It wasn't actually my first Final Fantasy. That honor (or dishonor\, depending on who you are) goes to FFX.  Seeing how much I enjoyed that game\, I decided to backtrack through the catalog.  Thus\, a couple of games later\, I stumbled on the majesty that is FF7.  The moment I booted up that game\, I knew I was in for something special.Despite the limitations of technology\, the somewhat unreliable translation\, and missteps here and there\, FF7 has stood the test of time as one of\, if not\, the greatest JRPG of all time.  The atmosphere\, plot\, characters\, and battle mechanics are truly a wonderful experience and something every JRPG fan should enjoy.  Whether or not you believe FF7 is overrated\, most will agree that it's place in gaming history is an important and significant one.That's why\, despite the recent SE track record\, I\, along with many others\, were very excited when they announced the FF7 remake.  For decades we discussed\, with childish gleefulness\, what a FF7 remake would look like. The idea of the world of FF7 being expanded upon with modern technology and a vast amount of resources made most of us extremely excited with high hopes of seeing our beloved game in a new light.  And then\, reality hit with the release of FF7R.It's not good.  I knew there was going to be many changes to the game.  How could there not be?  Most remakes of any medium suffer through such changes.  What I didn't expect was a complete butchering of the original plot and characters.  The amount of nonsense added into the plot and character changes basically makes this game not a FF7 remake\, but more of a Kingdom Hearts reboot\, masquerading in a FF7 suit.Before I complain\, let's start off with the good.  The combat\, atmosphere\, and certain expansions of side characters are all great; especially the character development of the rest of the cast of AVALANCHE and I personally think they did a good job with the design of Midgar.  They truly bring the mechanical city to life.  I also found the combat to be enjoyable; Nomura seems to have managed to take the best parts of FFXV and KH\, and combine it into something that is highly enjoyable and very intuitive to play.  The boss characters aren't just \""mash A to win\""; despite being an ARPG\, there is still a bit of strategy and thinking involved.  This is all good.Here's the bad: They have completely massacred FF7.  The plot has been convoluted with what I can only describe as \""Kingdom Hearts BS\"" (That's a quote from IGN\, not me).  I don't want to spoil anything but if you are going into this game expecting a \""faithful remake\"" or maybe even just \""a complete overhaul that hits all the major beats of the original\""\, you will be disappointed.  So many things have been changed that this feels like a deluded fans weird interpretation of what they think it SHOULD have been instead of what it was.  Decisions made completely change character's motivations\, flaws\, and the weight of their choices.  No longer are you hit with wonderful story telling\, character development\, and themes of loss\, accepting who you are\, and guilt like in the original.  No\, this \""remake\"" feels like a cash grab that found all the superficial aspects of the original and jacked it up to 11.  It honestly is a travesty and a complete betrayal to any of the OG fans and/or purists.If you can ignore all that (which how could you?  It's an JRPG; like most\, it's entire spirit revolves around it's plot)  There are still major issues.  The side quests are nothing but glorified fetch quests\, characters both new and old\, feel like flat\, hollow characters.  While Midgar does have amazing atmosphere\, the actual textures themselves are horrible.  The pacing of the game is also off; menial tasks seem to take unnecessarily forever\, most likely in an attempt to pad out the game.  This game either should have been 30% shorter with a smaller price tag or they shouldn't have padded out so much of Midgar and ended the journey farther along in the plot.  It honestly is a mess.This is why I'm giving the game a 5.  I just can not forgive what they did to the plot of this game.  It's borderline treason to those who have waited and begged for decades. We did not want some form of re-imagination or \""pseudo-sequel\""; what we wanted was a faithful remake with QoL changes and expansion of what was there (like how it was advertised).   While ridiculous\, all the people who are giving 0s are just fans who feel betrayed like I do.  There is a lot of good here\, specifically the combat.  But the bread and butter of what makes a good JRPG has been tainted.… Expand"
75366,FFVIIR,2020-04-13,0,"This review contains Spoilers.I wouldn't call myself a hardcore fan of the original FF7 however I had played trough the game as a kid and I really enjoyed the Advent Children film. I also think that FF7 has one of the strongest soundtracks of any game\, and the certainly did it justice here. However Final fantasy 7 and the remake is primarily a story game\, and that is why I have to give it a 0. The first 18 hours of this game were pretty decent to good. I enjoyed the combat and and the story\, and I especially liked the expanded Jessie backstory. However Once I got do the pillar section that's when things fell apart in a major way. Firstly with the gameplay. After 20 hours and having mastered the combat it started to feel a bit shallow but I could put up with that. What really grinded my gears were the helitroopers in the pillar section where you are forced to play as Cloud and later cloud and Tifa. Those bastards would hover outside the bounds of the arena thus giving you no chance to attack them\, and once they do come inside the arena and you jump in the air to get a few hits in they do an attack that takes away 500hp so the atb gauge I had build has to be used on healing and not ranged magic. They were a little annoying but i looked passed it and the Biggs and Jessie deaths were a strong point for sure where I got a little misty eyed. However when you got do the top of the pillar everything changed.At the top of the pillar you have to fight 2 of the Turks: Reno and Rude. We've met them before where Aerith tells us that they are \""good people\"". Well those \""Good people\"" are trying to commit a genocide by making a midgar plate fall on the slums\, the game tells us that 50000 people live in the slums but doesn't tell us how many live on the plate.Then income the changes from the original. In the original FF7 Reno sets of a timebomb\, you fight him and he runs away. In the Remake Reno is about to set off a time bomb\, you stop him beat Reno and Rude and then\, somehow Rude gets up dodges every bullet from Barrets arm gun which he is supposed to be a master with\, Deus Ex Machina ghosts show up\, a wonded Rude beats up Tifa who I mainly used to beat him with\, and then comes the most inexcusable thing of all. Rude walks to Reno\, picks him up\, and a Helicopter comes to pick them up and Barret Cloud and Tifa just let them fly away. That drove me over the edge. The main characters who Just lost their home\, friends and hundreds of thousands of people died\, just let the people who caused it walk away\, AND take the most logical transport to get themselves off the plate away. This is not how rational people act. Imagine this. I kill your best friend\, launch a nuke that will kill millions of people\, you have me at gunpoint\, would you let me just take the only transport to get to safety away? I know I would be seeking major revenge. Put they turned these characters into **** retards who just stand there and do nothing while Jessies murderers fly away. After that I had to quit the game.I tried to play the game again later but then the content padding started to really get to me. After coming back from Aeriths house the second time Tifa sais that Don Corleone would know how to get to shinra headquarters. And that is when I finally quit the game for real. Why do we have to do this extra thing again. Tifa has been living in Midgar for 5 years and Barret presumably even more\, why would the not know how to get to Shinra?We also find out that Wedge survived which is another kick in the balls since he was the least fleshed out character and the most boring out of the 3 avalance memberstl;dr: They handled the plate falling so bad that after that I just couldn't take the characters seriously. And after 20 hours the padding of content for the game wore me down. And most importantly these stupid inconsistent storywriters self insertion ghost do not belong in a Final fantasy game. They are just a Deus Ex Machina and that is not competent storywriting.… Expand"
75377,FFVIIR,2020-04-11,4,"Okay.  This review is coming from someone who bought and played the original Final Fantasy VII back in 1997 at the age of 14.  Played it religiously for years.  Still play it at least every other year for a full playthrough.Be Warned First:  THIS IS NOT A REMAKE as the title implies.  It's more of Final Fantasy VII: Alternate Universe Part 1.Now first I will say what I liked about it because I'll give credit where credit is due.  The combat system is fun and engaging.  The music at many points is gorgeous and spot on.  The music is bad too but I'll get to that later.  The voice acting is great and believable.The pacing seems fine for the most part.Now the bad.  And by bad I mean REALLY **** bad.They strayed so completely from the source material that this game can no longer be considered a remake.  Its designed more of an alternate universe prequel to Advent Children and a sequel to Crisis Core.  Some of the music is such a poor rendition of the original track that its distracting.  You find yourself listening closely to see if its the music that should be playing at that point/area in the game or not.The game is overall a marketing scam.  We were sold with the deliberate pitch that veteran FFVII players would get some moments of surprise.That is putting it mildly.  We didnt get moments of surprise. (SPOILERS BELOW)They rewrote the whole **** plot.  In the original game Sephiroth isn't even mentioned until he kills president Shinra near the end of disc 1.  In the game he bounces all over the place.  Constantly appearing and disappearing.  He kills president Shinra\, but he also kills Barrett.  Then guess what?  Barrett didnt die because a magical fate ghost saved him.  These stupid ass fate ghosts BTW will be appearing over and over again throughout the game.  Making sure that the current time line stays in accordance to FF7 I guess?  But then instead of walking into the sunset on your great adventure because president Shinra is dead and Cloud wants to pursue Sephiroth (who at this point in the original) is still a mysterious character that Cloud thought was dead) you fight the god of fate itself and then the Advent children version of Sephiroth thus changing the timelines and making Biggs back alive\, ZACH appears never died and set the timeline on the course to what it seems is going to lead Aerith (Aeris) to never die too.What the actual ****  I thought I was playing FF7 with better graphics\, sound/music and a more up to date combat system.  Not a bad remake of Back to the **** Future with Final Fantasy VII characters replacing DOC Brown and Marty Mcfly.Honestly the moments in the game that followed the original plot had me smiling ear to ear\, but the huge and story destroying alterations made me feel like I was reading a terrible fan fiction made by a virgin weeb whilst he stole ideas from a rejected script of Dr Who.TLDR:  IF you loved the original FFVII\, go play that. Don't buy this **** game.  If you never played the original\, go get the original and still don't buy this.  Its just so sad and depressing that this **** is what we got.… Expand"

Like many here I first played the original FF7 when I was around age 12\, leaving a significant mark on my childhood. In the 21 years that have passed I've finished the original at least 50 times\, done a few runs of Crisis Core\, and watched Advent children.Positive;- Graphics- Music- Battle systemEven though textures are surprisingly bad in some maps I'm generally positive about the graphics. Especially the main characters are exceptionally well done\, and the majority is pure eye-candy.Some tracks are a bit 'overdone' or lower quality than Uematsu's classic tracks but I still loved most of it. It was beautiful hearing the classic themes I remember in a new coating.I've seen many criticising the battle system\, but I believe with it being a hybrid this is as good as it gets. The battles are fast paced\, interactive\, and even though the AI seems lacking at times\, with some fast swaps and command inputs with L2 and R2 this is no deal-breaker.Mixed;- Voice acting- PacingThough some are especially well done (mainly Barret)\, I have mixed feelings. Some voices don't seem to 'match' and miss the emotional depth I expect them to have in certain scenarios and contexts.When it comes to movement the game tends to feel very 'sluggish' at times. Narrow alleyways\, frustratingly slow movements in some spaces\, and the inability to simply walk/run faster in specific places seem just there to extend the game.Further the game is loaded with needless 'boring' detours (every path is always blocked\, and bridges always break) that increase the gap between main events to the extent it completely takes away their value and meaning. Endless corridors\, ladders\, switches and enemies for pretty much every dungeon does not equal good content for me.Negative things;- Lineair/Railroading- Sidequests/Padding- Story..Now one of my main issues - especially compared to the original game - you have next to no freedom. It is literally spelled out for you through the entire game where you absolutely must move. In case you want to look around a bit you get told off\, followed by a slow turn around. It feels like you're constantly in a narrow box without freedom of movement to forcefully follow the script.The padding and sidequests are nothing short of obnoxious. The sidequests would've been fine would they have any relevance to the story line (think about Fort Condor in FF7 for example\, optional bosses like weapons etc.)\, however\, the sidequests feel like they've been taken straight from a random generic MMORPG\, with zero relevance. They are but simple fetch quests\, kill x enemy quests for random characters that nobody really cares about. Had this been in the original game it would've felt equally out of place\, as it would demean the story.Last\, the story. I expected some adaptations\, perhaps in the sense of fleshing out characters\, and going more in depth on all the facts around the events. However\, the story as presented in the remake for me was the difference between an 8 and a 4. Now I think we can safely assume that the audience the remake was intended for are people that have played at least the original game\, and preferably crisis core. I find it hard to believe people that have no affinity whatsoever with the original game would understand what is going on. Think about flashbacks\, the identity and relevance of some characters\, and the significance of the final ending sequence - because let's face it\, you don't get a lot of background information at all.So if the audience was intended to be mainly oldschool FF7 players\, why change the story so drastically towards the ending? I understand very well where they were going with the ending\, and in what perspective it has to be seen. To go against fate\, and against the 'known facts'. But this is at least not what I wanted for this game.The game severely lacks the original slow-burn feel of impending doom and build up towards significant events that take place. Instead we get an installment with a lot of sensory-overload and zero build-up to actually make certain events seem relevant. Different timelines\, alternate realities\, and the ending in general does not add anything to a story that was already great\, and - from my perspective - they feel absolutely nonsensical. After I finished the game I couldn't help but feel a pretty big 'what the actual ****' boiling up.With this said\, this game - even if awesome in many aspects - does not feel like a REMAKE\, but more like a modernised spin-off that seems to miss the point in regards to what actually made this game great in the first place. The freedom\, the mystery\, and the story. I honestly feel like SE missed an opportunity here to make something great by choosing this route\, and I really hope they manage to surprise me in some unforeseen way in the upcoming releases. It's painful for me to give this game a negative rating. It just could've been so much more.… Expand"

Instead of crafting a whole new system to fit what they were working on\, something that highlights the way battles take place that accentuates the frenetic pace they've set here; they instead shoved a 20+ years combat philosophy and style where it doesn't belong. Not only that\, but the damage balance is broken at every level.Normal mode damage is way over-tooled\, forcing you further into the janky combat system. Let's not kid ourselves; you're going to tunnel one character for an entire fight until the game forces you to switch\, and when it does\, you'll tunnel combat over items or even spells (unless they force you into it). That is the horrible design\, and they could have avoided all of it had they\, just\, made\, something new. Instead\, the caved to fanboy fear and shoveled this convoluted mess out.Easy\, is UNDER-Tooled and saps any and all fun out of combat. It's not like there's a lesser risk from combat--there's NO risk in combat. The most straightforward answer here would have been to come to market with a wholly new system for combat and not one tugging at nostalgia.Classic\, shouldn't exist. At that point\, Square Enix should have gone full out and made this a movie and not pretend it was a game.FF7 Remake sums up Square Enix perfectly. Grandious design\, meticulous attention to detail in presentation and style\, but Dear Lord\, Do I have to make a Video Game? I really don't want to make a video game anymore! I want to make movies!! Please let us make a movie?!? The ironic thing is when they are allowed to make a movie; they're horrible.I really hope after this release they take stock of their priorities and hunker down and focus back on Game mechanics and gameplay because right now\, Square Enix is lost.Grade per points as mentioned earlier:Music: A+Voice Acting: A+Graphics: A+Art direction: A+Presentation of Total Package: A+Game Mechanics: F-Side note: The awful camera is awful\, just awful. So\, very\, very bad. There's no fixing it\, it's just bad.Update:4/27/2020:After spending a lot more time with the game\, I took a point off for the awful linear corridor design. The damn hand-holding this game does it has all the frustration of FF13. You can't explore those side paths\, you can't go check this building\, YOU HAVE TO GO HERE NOW WHERE WE TELL YOU!I can take a bit of this in a game\, but it's the entire thing folks. There's no grinding\, there's no exploring. You go where they tell you to do and screw you for thinking otherwise! (until Chapter 14\, basically the end of the game). It's another point against Square Enix for really\, really\, REALLY wanting to make interactive movies and not games.Combat is still awful. I don't think I've ever played a game where the game part is the part I want to get through as fast as possible. I've hated every single fight I've had in the game\, without fail. And I mean\, trash fights\, awful. Boss fights\, awful. All of it is just so\, god damn bad.If you're shouting about great the battle system is\, you're a masochist that hates good things. There is no middle ground here. No shades of grey. Normally I'd wouldn't be the type to be so black and white about something. With this game\, it's all bad. If all the other elements weren't top-notch\, I would have shelved this and never looked back. But\, the rest of the package is just stellar.… Expand"

The dull and repetetive corridor **** broke me. And I know there's much more of the same in the chapters to come. So I'll watch the rest on youtube.While the main scenario cutscenes are great and frankly speaking all a fan could dream of and more\, the gameplay is just horendous pile of garbage. But this is a GAME for **** sake. It is supposed to be played. Not watched. So what do we have beside the amazingness that is FF7R the movie?Repetetive gameplay\, boring bloated mazes with ve-e-e-ry informative chit chat from your companions. Locked doors to open\, keycards to find\, switches to push\, and levers to pull. All that is sprinkled with Cloud constantly shimmying in narrow spaces to allow for the game to load more of the same **** and the WARNING icon for when you try to have fun. Who's idea of entertainment is this? Even the characters themselves comment on that from time to time. They're like...\""Cloud we know this is fecal\, but we have to press on\"". How could you **** it up so badly. Man. This game is a drag. And the quests? Lol. Find some **** find some kids\, bring this here\, take that there. Mob hunts. Done. Yeah right\, it's the FF7 glory as we remember it. And while're doing these meaningful quests you learn about the characters you love. You'll learn that Tifa is a waifu. Aerith is very nice. Jessie wants to **** but maybe not\, because syke. God.The combat is all over the place. You've used the assess materia - you know the combination. You're good. You don't. Well tough luck. Reload. Sit through the loading screen. Try again. FUN! Hope you like hearing the same lines from your team over and over again. Activating combat mode combat resolved ptsd to the max.And the story....Oh lord have mercy. Nomura san\, you just had to do it\, didn't you. You just needed to inject some of your destiny ass keyhole aids into a perfectly fine story. But wait. If the story was left as it was this game would be BORING. Right? Sure. Yeah. Thanks squeenix. And thanks Nomura\, for ****ting all over what could have been something really amazing. **** you too by the way.Don't believe those nostalgia induced 10 outta 10s. I've watched lots of reviews for this game. They ususally go as follows: Well um the quests are lame\, but the game is amazing. Well the corridor stuff kinda sucks\, but I'm so thrilled for what's to come. Well I was sitting there pressing X screaming OH MY GOD I DON'T **** CARE!!!! But i like what they did with the characters. Graphics looks really really bad\, but the game is an eye-candy. What?!I don't really get where this is coming from\, and i don't really care. Crazy people be crazy i suppose. Again. Cutscenes are great. Rest is cancer.On a more positive note...I like that I've lost any faith in SE capability to produce anything fun. I mean they did prepare me for this for quite some time now. It started with FFXIII. And after FFXV\, i'd say this game is a tremendous success. So honestly i'm not dissapointed in the slightest. Too late for a refund though\, so that's a shame. But oh well.P.S. Check out the four identical copies of and old man in an apron in the area by the orphanage. It is sublime.… Expand"

Well\, it's not what I expected. A lot of the dialog feels weird or off. Characters will say things that seem incredibly awkward or misplaced. Barrett seems like they changed him in to a full blown psychopath Greenpeace terrorist. And I get it\, Avalanche were basically terrorists at the time\, but Barret just seems so over the top it isn't funny. Then I remember that this first installment of the game only goes up until the point you actually leave Midgar. The developers said they wanted to tell a bigger\, wider story. I don't know if I feel inclined to believe that. The slums in Midgar are just terrible mazes of hallways with little pockets of open spaces\, all of the environments in this area all look the same and it gets to the point traveling without the mini map is actually almost impossible.Adding to that is the fact there are areas you just can't go to. They are either literally locked off\, or the game will simply force you to turn around and tell you to get bent. There's a ton of optional quests that are either fetch quests or combat quests. And they are placed so far apart they have you running to opposite fringes of the slums to complete them. The developers must have realized that their design of the slums were awful\, because they added options to automatically go back to a quest giver after you complete your tasks.So far none of these quests feel meaningful in any capacity. Go kill some rats\, go find my cats\, go talk to this NPC. These quests and the characters that are involved with them are almost instantly forgotten by me. This doesn't feel like it's expanding the story or the world in a thoughtful way. This feels like padding tacked on as an excuse not to present the whole story in a single installment.I sometimes wonder if it's because Final Fantasy 7 came on so many disks that the developers felt inclined to drag the entire story out or if it was sheer greed motivating them\, stretching the series out as far as they could to milk it as long as possible. I feel inclined to believe it's the later. People need to remember Final Fantasy 7 wasn't actually all that long\, the extra disks that came with the original game were there mostly to gold all the CGI elements\, not the major contents of the game itself. The combat system is what it is. It feels clunky and oddly paced to me. They included a optional mode called classic mode that makes an attempt at emulating the classic combat feeling of the original game while still using their own combat system\, almost as if the developers realized people weren't going to like their new combat system.Bottom line is this\, the game feels badly paced\, a lot of the additional story telling feels forgettable\, the dialog is weird and the combat is clunky. After waiting so long for a remake of Final Fantasy\, this isn't what I was expecting and it's not really what I wanted.… Expand"

The remake helps build upon the original game and also some changes in the remake would be weird and stupid if you haven't played the original. However you can play without it the original\, as the game is still amazing.As for the gameBefore starting the review I would like to add that if you have never played the original Final Fantasy VII then I would highly recommend you doing so. The remake helps build upon the original game and also some changes in the remake would be weird and stupid if you haven't played the original. However you can play without it the original\, as the game is still amazing.As for the game itself\, it is one of my favorite games to date. Next to Nier Automata\, God of War\, Bloodborne and Metal Gear solid 3: Snake Eater. This game made me feel like I was a kid again\, playing a game for a whole day without noticing the time. Going to sleep\, to just wake up again to start playing once more.Game play itself is very fun and can require quite a bit of strategy to play. You can't just brute force the fight with just one button\, the game requires attention to your characters setup and your ability to make use of every character in battle. Mini games are very fun and can be very challenging if you want to 100 percent it. However there are some negatives \, air combat could use some work\, you would fly up to the enemy to do some hits but if they move\, you would stay stationary and just smack thin air. Bike fights is bare minimum good and can be a chore at longer fights\, could use some extra skills or abilities to help break the monotone note of the fight.Graphics is what I would have hoped for a modern remake of FFVII. Great backdrops\, amazing character details and the effects are eye catching. With some positives there are some negatives\, some textures can be very poor if you stare at them long enough\, some other backdrops later in the game are very poor and the game is running mostly at 30 (as a pc player I would have prefer 60 minimum)Sound design is probably near perfect in my opinion. The town background chatter makes the game feel alive and lived in. All the original song are remixed well and have made each boss fight that much more epic when they took time to remix the battle song for every one of them. Honestly for the English voice acting I thought I would dislike them\, but all the casts voice eventually grew on me and I love every one of them. The few negative points I can think of is that I am not convince of Tifa's combat voice acting\, when she does her grunts and the anime grunts they used often at the beginning\, which is barely there afterwards....which is a very minor nitpicking gripe.The story for me is great. I would emphasize for \""me\"" because this is where most polarizing grades is changed because of the story\, but I personally loved it. They took what is about 4-5 hours of the original game into a 35 - 40 hours in this. They expand the world of Midgar with new areas\, give side characters amazing development that I barely remember back in the original\, and makes the main characters feel more unique and deep. Now for the negatives\, the shadows are a pain and seem to ruin the flow of the game\, the story starts to unfold more or less at the end of the game which feels like a bad exposition dump but since this is like....part 1 of whatever I can somewhat forgive it.Now I would give this a 10/10 despite the flaws. I really loved the original FVII and this does color my review quite a bit. However there are some other amazing game that colors it differently (TLOU2) so I feel like game reviews can and will always be subjective depending on how well the writer and developer can deliver their message in the game. Critically I would say this game is a 8.5/10 with the flaws\, and a 9.0/10 when some graphics can be fixed (pc port....hopefully). But for me who grew up with FFVII\, this remake is what I imagine what the original game was in my mind\, this game made me feel like I was a kid again. For a game that makes me feel this happy again\, I have to give it a 10/10.… Expand"

75735,FFVIIR,2020-04-10,10,"To keep it brief\, this is an absolutely fantastic game. I'll break down all of the key sections I want to cover. As a disclaimer: minor spoilers ahead.Story:The pacing is great\, and while it takes a little bit to fully \""buy in\"" to this game's story (especially if you're a huge FF7 fan)\, it does land. I'm not the biggest fan of the 'time ghost' nonsense either\, but it's not as pervasive as the reviews might suggest. What is important to note is that there are other story adjustments beyond the time ghost stuff\, and some of them are actually pretty fantastic. Biggs\, Wedge\, and Jessie all play more involved roles\, which ends up being a very welcome addition.Sound Design/Music:It's\, again\, fantastic. The soundtrack knocks it out of the park. If there is any gripe I have\, it's that there are key moments where you're looking for the EXACT same piece that Nobuo wrote\, but you end up getting some sort of remixed version of the tune. Despite that\, the amount of different 'takes' on the classic songs is tremendous\, and along the way\, this decision becomes more and more acceptable. Great stuff.Characterization:As others have mentioned\, they've done a great job of staying true to all of the characters\, while adding additional material and story beats that doesn't take away too much from the iconic team you remember.Combat/Gameplay:Your mileage may vary\, but I really enjoy this as well. It's not as 'press X to win' as other games of similar genres that I've encountered. The materia system is incorporated in a pretty clever way\, as is the 'ATB' system. While it's not ultra-complex\, it does take a bit to wrap your head around everything: utilizing abilities frequently\, leveraging the strengths of your party members\, issuing commands\, and the different modes your characters can take on. I have to say they did a great job on this all in all\, but as a deviation from the original turn-based combat system that FF7 had\, I'm anticipating a mixed response to it. I ultimately think the choice to overhaul the combat was a very\, very wise one.In conclusion:It's a fantastic game. I really think it's worth the time of day if you enjoyed the original and\, in particular\, enjoyed the early game Midgar stuff in Disc 1. While it won't hit you immediately\, Midgar's character really\, really shines through. The setpieces and characterization are phenomenal\, and I honestly had a LOT of fun. Gripes include: took me a bit to enjoy the world and combat system\, this section of the story only covers the Midgar part of the game\, and some time-ghost shenanigans add an awkward addition to parts of the story. That said\, it's a fully-fleshed out game in its own right\, and there is a LOT of awkward\, lovable Cloud to go around. I love this game.… Expand"

For this game too\, you might notice that scores are extremes (0-2 or 9-10) mostly\, rather than being a healthy curve. For users\, it would be best to judge a game compared to games in the same price tier and generation. Bias should not be present on either side\, building on nostalgia or personal agenda is wrong. Focus on the game and don't \""counter\"" other ratings. An account and 75 characters should not be the minimum for a review.)In terms of visuals\, the game is definitely up to date in most areas. The use of lighting and the character models are the apparent highlights. There is a particular color palette that gives it all a certain feel\, which is rarely changed up\, but it makes sense for the most part as long as it fits thematically. There is some \""jank\""\, hair for example can look weird at times\, and sometimes the bleak colors are more noticeable. The animations might not flow into one another naturally always\, but they look quite good. The particles can be a little overwhelming\, but overall the visual effects mostly have impact and pop out nicely. Smaller enemies can often blend into the background though\, and in some indoor (or rather outdoor but functionally still a small closed space) \""rooms\"" it feels like your scope of vision is getting strangled by the surroundings\, not sure how to describe it better.The characters get time to shine and feel distinct enough for the most part. Outside of cutscenes\, banter between them is something you'll hear relatively often\, either in combat or at certain points where scripted. These can be quite fun\, perhaps they get old after a while. In cutscenes\, the unique animations they all use look great and natural for the most part\, but expect some anime-like behavior too. On that note\, grunting and other noises are common for a lot of movements or reactions where they don't feel all that natural - mostly subjective\, but since the characters otherwise look and try to act realistic (as in less cartoony)\, it can lead to some awkwardness. Non-playable characters are worse off in this area\, their animations can be relatively weird.I should mention that the soundtrack's quality is definitely great. There's an issue with variety\, which could be an issue\, \""luckily\"" the game is not all that long for it to be a major problem; it only takes away from some uniqueness some bosses could have had.There is a certain feel that is very different based on the character used or the encounter. By this I mean a difference in quality primarily\, that it can be either tedious and mechanically flat but also somewhat tight and exciting. Barret is understandably not that fun to control\, I've seen players prefer Tifa for a good reason where possible\, and that might be because of the better mechanical feel when she's controlled. There's even sort of a combo that you can do\, Cloud can also feel like that to some extent with the mode swap parry/swap back attack even. The reason I think it's important to touch on this further\, is because this gives the impression that a more action combat focused version of the gameplay is immediately more exciting and involved. A proposed solution would have been (or still could be via updates) a mode that is balanced in a way that blocks are better\, staggers are faster\, the command menu doesn't slow\, more damage is dealt and received. There could have been a way to implement jumping into the game for aerial combat\, now characters autojump in a weird way to targets if possible\, which doesn't feel too natural\, especially since targeting can be weird. The other end of the spectrum would be a classic turn based/ATB system\, but the classic mode in the game doesn't really feel deliberate and well designed\, you still have to interact with the pseudo-action combat a lot. Enemies\, bosses especially can feel like bullet sponges\, adding tedium to the excitement. Still\, the flair of combat and the decisions made before encounters can offset these.Content-wise the game is about fine\, as long as you do all the side content. The rewards are usually worth the trouble\, even if not all side quests are interesting to do. So far\, there have been positive changes to the story\, like characters getting more fleshed out or other interactions or scenes. There have also been negative changes\, which results in some pacing issues. More major changes are rare\, but one could prove detrimental down the line\, for now it's concerning. Since this is just a spoiler-free review\, I'll refrain from going further into it and stay neutral. Keep in mind that at 50 pounds it's not the best value for the amount of content\, so the quality has to make up for it. The game is carried by aesthetics and recognizable characters in that regard\, not the most compelling for every buyer.7 ~ 8 sounds right\, but I can only give either one. Character limit oof.Stay safe all!… Expand"

Most certainly not an RPG game.The leveling system just kind of happens and is irrelevant. If you just do the story\, you get levels and it doesn't feel like it makes any difference. Not once during the game did I look at my stats or how close I was to leveling\,I never cared about leveling up Materia because it didn't seem to matter much. If you just kind of went through the game\, that all took care of itself\, at no point did you ever feel compelled to kill something for the purpose of getting XP/AP/SP90% of the way through the game I still didn't even understand where SP came from and how weapons leveled up or why new cores were introduced...and it simply did not matter.The weapons themselves seemed in my mind to violate the 'RPG' expectations the most... you get new weapons throughout the game... but defying all RPG design\, the new weapons aren't usually better. Each character gets 6 weapons\, but their best weapon tends to be the 2nd\, 3rd or 4th they get. So getting the end game later chapter weapons seem largely useless\, its more a matter or style of completion rather than getting stronger.It feels like being 10% better at the combat system is probably the equivalent of being 10 'levels' better. I kind of find this generally to be the problem of having a skill based combat system in a game where its traditionally been geared to people's stat improvement and leveling. I felt this for FF15 as well.The side quests too\, while they exist\, exist in a weird form where the sidequests aren't side quests\, they're just quests and you're told when its time to do them. You hit points in the game where they just kind of say 'Ok\, time to do 6 quests now' I suppose you can skip some\, but the game even warns you not to. Similarly with hidden items and materia\, if you miss one the game will actually tell you at the end of some sections 'Warning\, if you continue you will lose access to items you missed' it's very strange. It kind of takes the approach that nothing is really a secret or actual side-task or goal\, its all just the main goal and they expect most people will do all of it.Then you get to the part that almost made me simply stop playing. The cutscenes\, the cutscenes the cutscenes. The game is a movie. There are several sections where you go well over an hour with no combat\, no puzzle to solve\, no decision to be made... just 'Go in this building\, cutscene\, walk over there\, cut scene\, open the door\, cutscene\, talk to this guy\, cutscene' At one point the game literally tells you to go up 59 flights of stairs.... and you just go up 59 flights of stairs.The game even decides as you go higher\, you're tired so you slow down.I just re-watched a video of someone doing it\, and there's a dialogue cutscene\, then literally 9:30 to climb the stairs...followed by a cutscene again.I found that after being about 70% of the way through\, I wanted to finish it\, but it really felt like a chore. I spent so much time just putting the controller down and walking away as another cutscene played. Many times I'd start to play\, walk away and forget i was even playing.The other major thing\, and maybe it's my fault\, but i went in without many spoilers\, other than the fact that I of course played the original FF7... And I did know it wasn't the full game...BUT\, I had heard it described as 'only half the game'It's no where near half the game\, this remake encompasses maybe 15% of the original game. The original had about 30 'parts' and this is parts 1 through 5.Overall the thing is still good\, i'm kiiiind of glad i played it but it just is not an RPG\, there's never an open world\, its only a fraction of the story and it's mostly a movie.… Expand"

Any attempt to do this in this game will cause an AI to say \""Not that way Cloud!\"" while blocking you off.   I was expecting the story to be a little watered down due to that fact that they had to  \""fill up \"" a lot of the time in order to create enough content for events happening before Midgar.  This caused a lot of quests to feel empty and pointless.  I really don't wanna spend an hour looking for a kid's missing cat\, or posting posters up on the walls you know?  Also the battle system was just ok. I preferred the original wher eI had full control over every character\, not just one.  The battles we fun back then\, and the materia and summons too.  Summons are reduced to \""simulators' this time around which felt kinda dumb.  But I guess they're setting up for the real thing in later installments (hopefully).

Individualized abilities gives every character a different advantage (though Aerith's power attack is absolutely pointless). Some materia are much more useful than they originally were. The new leveling system for weapons makes old weapons stay relevant. Overall\, the progression of experience / difficulty is totally appropriate\, but of course that's easier to do when limiting the experience to just Midgar rather than the whole original game.However...Pro / Con:- Instead of random battles\, creatures are given real-world contexts that make them truly inhabit the world. Towns are filled with people\, and minor characters are further established in ways they never originally were; I'd complain about Johnny if I didn't have more time with Jesse...A couple added characters did throw me off; Chadley seems to fit the aesthetic of a post-FFX character\, while eventually adding another story element that you would think would be more central to the plot.- Side quests\, though necessary\, can be a little bit redundant. While that alone isn't a deal-breaker\, there're way too many scenarios where you're forced to walk slowly when there isn't really anything happening\, which is fine on the first playthrough\, but you're going to get really sick of it before finishing hard mode.- Though the environments are so much more what they should be\, some textures did appear to come from PS3-era development\, particularly the slum areas. (we get it! it's supposed to look crummy!)- Voice acting is 99% on-point\, both overall tone and delivery; However\, a good amount of added dialogue scenarios can seem kind of forced. Which leads to what is easily the greatest factor to the quality of this game:The Writing.(The major con)Playing through this\, I can't even explain how good most of the chapters were in terms of hitting home with emotionally pertinent moments from the original game. I was actually really feeling the train station flashback with Ifalna in a way I never did.If it delivers on the goods\, then what's the issue? Am I just being nitpicky because there're additions to the story?No. Not even remotely. I'm positive multiple additions to this game will forever remain canonical to the original experience as choices originally intended by the writers.But there's one singular element that legitimately ruined the game as a whole\, and honestly\, it's just not going to come with a spoiler warning because it's completely irrelevant to anything else that's a legitimate story device in the game; They actualized destiny with an entity that solely exists to fill gaps in writing that didn't exist because the original story didn't need holes plugged; They cheapened human motive.If you know the original story\, you know challenging destiny was never mentioned once in the entire texts\, and it should be really obvious as to why if you actually appreciated it\, which would be because these people are driven by their own will; The people involved are driven to continue because of complex situations affecting their deepest desires snowballing into a scenario where the fate of all life on the planet is clearly in the hands of the main characters through inevitability. Do you realize how much gets taken away from that when the outcome of these events rests on imposing forces that have no discernable sense of reasoning?

Considering how minor every other issue is\, you could've had an actual perfect remake if you just trusted the source material more.Literally the entire last boss fight\, I was saying out loud \""This doesn't make any sense. Why am I even here?\"" That's such a jarring difference from literally crying a few chapters earlier.Overall... Definitely check this game out.

I didn't hate it either\, but I certainly didn't think it was the world-changing epic that a lot of people think it is.The remake is on a technical level an absolute triumph. It looks incredible (although some of the backdrops in some scenes are pretty low-quality)\, the sound is great\, the voice acting is even pretty good. The remake is a failure to me in two simple ways: the changes to the story are completely unnecessary\, and the combat sucks.I don't want to spoil anything\, but the way they've decided to tell you the story now is through long\, blathering cutscenes\, and they break up every single thing you do. Having fun with this side quest that's really heating up? There's going to be a mandatory cutscene that will make the pace completely stumble and you'll lose that positive momentum and start to feel bogged down. Getting excited about that next story development and can't wait to get down those stairs to fight the next Big Bad Guy? There's going to be some mandatory slowing-down\, and you're going to hear some lame and purposeless forced dialogue between your party members for no reason other than \""hey guys\, look! It's Tifa! She has something to say!\"". Finally\, they have decided to put one particular\, very important character in virtually every single thing you see - as opposed to the original where the reveal of this character is teased until the right moment\, in this one you get to watch this one guy virtually every five minutes\, showing up for no reason whatsoever\, just to remind you \""hey! Stay tuned\, this guy's big scene is still coming up!\"". It feels like Silent Hill after SH2\, where they shoehorn Pyramid Head into everything.The combat mashes up the worst parts of FFXIII and FFXV into a complete and utter mess that feels at best boring and at worst completely and utterly pointless. It's high on spectacle but almost wafer-thin in engagement\, and I think it's most telling when you get to the fact that on certain settings\, the game will literally play itself. The changes they've made to the Materia system and the utterly pointless not-Zodiac-Grid leveling system are absolutely unnecessary because again\, they have created a game that plays itself. This isn't a dealbreaker - I loved FFXII\, a game that is built almost entirely around programming your party members and simply watching that machine work - but when there's so little else to do you need to have SOMETHING.This wasn't worth the wait. This isn't worth the price. When it's in the bargain bin it might be a fun game to fire up and play with your old friends\, but it's gonna be awhile before then. And hey\, there's still at least one more full-priced \""episode\"" to anticipate before the story's done.… Expand"

The party didn't \""earn\"" that fight from a narrative point of view\, there was no proper organic build-up to it\, no heartfelt personal stakes conveyed to the player\, and as a result the reaped rewards felt underwhelming (if not meaningless)\, while also projecting a jarring\, potentially ridiculous effect on future events: good luck explaining how that very same party will struggle to defeat mushrooms\, snakes and bats from now on!… Expand"

Non the less the areas we do see feel alive\, vibrant and look great apart from some texture issues.My main gripe with the game is the massive story changes at the end of the game.

Also\, the motercycle rides are A+. Soon we are introduced to a familiar face and the interactions between this character and cloud are amazing.

It's 100% crap bred with 100% crap\, meaning purebred crap with no additives.  The whisper models themselves are pretty damn lame\, and what they represent... well... let's just say that they wrote in a nonsense plotline to give themselves room to make major changes in the future if they want to.Because of this garbage plotline at least one\, maybe two\, characters that were dead when you're leaving Midgar in the original are now alive.  One character is a major WTF if he actually is alive... like the story won't work lol so much would be different.It also made the ending drag ooooon foreeeeever I was so ready for it to be done.  Not a good feeling.And... they kinda **** ruined Sepheroth for the new players.  In the original\, he's ominous\, in the shadows of Cloud's memories\, and all you see is the destruction he leaves behind.  It's a slow and powerful build.Remember the wurmb scene?  It's not gonna be nearly as impressive anymore now that the new players have seen the party fight Sepheroth AND WIN once already...Stupid stupid stupid.  Bad ending is bad.

FF7 Remake is quality game\, but something feels out of place. It occasionally has very fluent feeling gameplay moments and nice additions to the original story\, but somehow the mechanics feel dull and most times you have no idea what is happening on the screen due to the overused effects and too fast pacing of the battles. FF7 Remake as a title is also misleading\, this in no measure is a full FF7 and it would have been more honest to call this FF7 Remake episode 1. My first playthough got me fun of a little less than 40hours\, then again I do like to grind for the extra points before proceeding the mainstory. There is also possibility to adjust the difficulty between Classic\, Easy and Normal modes\, classic mode being more of give commands to proceed and Easy/Normal modes being closer to FFXV type of battle system. Normal mode is quite challenging propably for most players\, but to me I would have been happier if there was Hard mode available from the start. There is a second playtrough after finishing the first finish\, that also allows you go to Hard mode\, and you can pick chapters freely to pursue grinding more. The second playthrough or a typical new game+ feels just over glued way to try and extend the experience with too little more to give. Overall this game left me with very mixed feelings\, yes it’s FF7 in it’s core\, but it feels more that they put more to the cinematics\, voices and motioncapture than was nescessary and the gameplay suffered due to this. Also there are new characters and plots that overlay with the old story\, which some of them work and some made me feel they belong to some other universe. Still I definitely recommend the experience\, but also would say that you should not expect anything groundbreaking.… Expand"

Although the story is 1/3 of the original\, the developer's decisions of multi-part games are justified if it continues to develop its characters and world-building like in this game.I was skeptical of the game being multi-part but with FF7R\, I'm all in on the \""episodic\"" games even though they seem like cash grabs.If you're an FF7 fan\, this game contains the same charm that the original provided with a few filler content. I recommend buying the game. The combat system stands out the most as it combines the old turn-based and the new style of real-time action. I found myself strategizing more in the first few chapters of FF7R with tactical mode than the entirety of FF15. The game is not turned based which may disappoint some fans but FF7R's combat system is truly a fun experience.If you've never played any FF games or the original FF7. I recommend buying the game. The story is easy enough to understand but there are some easter eggs that require some type of knowledge of the FF7 compilation.

Which creates a lot of opportunities to enrich the experience for players and hold them back at the same time.All the characters that we know and love have been fleshed out and brought to life\, but I can't help but feel that the story telling suffers because we only see a snapshot of the overarching plot. The key moments from the original are beautifully told with some solid voice acting and visuals. But overall\, there are so many references to the main plot of the original that it creates this mystery that comes across as weird and convoluted for anyone walking in with fresh eyes. Not to mention the amount of filler in between chapters that really disrupts the flow of the story as we move from section to section.The visuals and sound are absolutely stunning of course. The music contains one of the best scores in a video game I have heard in years. Add those two elements to the new real time/turn based game-play\, plus min-games\, there is fun to be had. Not to mention the character progression along with the equipment management system is a breeze to use. So amongst the hit and miss structure of the journey itself\, FF7 remake does provide an enjoyable experience through its exceptional presentation and game-play.Look\, this remake swings very very hard! And with that\, it hits some major home runs\, but misses a lot of big throws too. If you have never played FF7\, please pick up the original. It is rough to look at these days\, but it is a great adventure and story that will not disappoint. If you start with the remake\, you would be forgiven for feeling a little lost.For those FF7 lovers out there\, you will be rewarded with a AAA experience that will hit you in the nostalgia nostrils. But even with the improved game-play\, you might be left wanting even just a little after the journey is done.… Expand"

So skeptical that I cancelled my preorder to avoid being disappointed. I picked it up a few months later after seeing some reviews and finally decided to play it and I was wonderfully surprised. Not only is it one of the best looking games I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing\, it took the story in unexpected ways that I’d say we’re mostly satisfying. Combat was a huge challenge since I much rather prefer turn based. The combat is really hit or miss\, it’s either extremely fun and rewarding or makes me want to turn the game off from frustration. The characters I thought were portrayed greatly and Cloud especially had great development. The expanding of Midgar and some side characters were also very good. Not to mention the stellar voice acting. Personally my biggest gripe with the game was the pacing and the “newcomer friendly” aspect of it. This game could have easily been cut down 10 hours and didn’t have to drag on at certain points. It felt more like they were trying to hit a quota instead of putting meaning-full content to fill gaps and instead they said “Here’s a gauntlet of enemies and endless corridors”. Especially towards the middle and end the pacing can come to a stand still with moments from the original that took 5 minutes now taking an hour+. The pacing can get extremely slow and tedious overall. And for newcomers to the FF7 world I think this game will be very tough for them. This game I’d say absolutely relies on the knowledge of knowing the first game or atleast the general aspect of it. For that reason I’d suggest playing the original first. In general while I don’t want to sound like a old man and harp on about the original I think this remake takes that beginning section and really does improve it for the better. But with pacing and slight story issues there is definitely improvements that can be made in the games to come. I was extremely pleased with this game and cannot wait for the sequel/2nd part.… Expand"

The Remake has happened and as a long-term fan\, who played the original in 1997 (which\, by the way\, made me a video game enthusiast that I am now)\, I'm incredibly torn (meaning: disappointed). Everyone already knows the obvious: yes\, the visuals are gorgeous\, the music is amazing\, all the fan-service and easter eggs are there\, and all of that could and will make a senior FF7 fan shed a tear of nostalgic joy. The fact that this is a Midgar-only installment is controversial not without a reason\, and the expanded\, or even altered at some points\, story\, will rub some fans the wrong way. But I won’t talk about this\, as this has been discussed ad nauseum already.What I want to focus on is the general atmosphere of the game\, something that I’ve already seen in FFXV\, and which not only annoys me\, but also is\, in my opinion\, slightly disturbing (yes\, the word is correct).No\, not only the fact that the game is a PG-16 title\, and most of the dialogues and themes seem to be directed at 10 year olds. No\, I wasn’t expecting something at the level of The Last of Us\, but I was slightly hoping that the game\, at least in some portion\, will be directed at people who played the original\, who are sometimes well over 30\, and expect the game to grow up with them. Unfortunately\, it’s not the case\, but this can be forgiven easily\, given that the developers need their income\, and apparently there are many more gamers younger than 20 than older than 30. No biggie\, I can seriously plough through this and even enjoy it at times\, it’s an entertainment after all\, not the philosophical alternative cinema club.What I can’t savour though is the share amount of completely generic\, uninspired\, boring and sometimes downright shallow amount of content\, seen mostly in the side quests\, but sometimes even in the main arc. The game is stretched to impossibility by side quests which literally say “go there and kill that”\, which wouldn’t be that bad if it wasn’t just that\, Cloud is a mercenary after all\, and having any background for grinding is\, or at least seems to\, be always better than having to background at all. But when a mercenary\, who blows up equivalents of our nuclear reactors killing hundreds of people in the process takes up an order to kill a few rats in the backyard from a whimpy twink\, who also has the gall to say pretentious stuff like “you did it\, I knew you would\, you’ll be a mercenary in no time”\, this is when I need a coffee break\, possibly for a day or two. The side content not only seems to be rammed in the game well after the postproduction to artificially extend the play time\, but also seems to be made by people who not only have never played Final Fantasy 7\, but who haven’t played any Final Fantasy game at all\, and the only point of reference for them are MMOs\, and only those less ambitious ones. I would really be less offended if the full play time was 10 hours\, or that the only way to get some additional levels was to mindlessly run in circles in a dungeon. Seriously.This\, and also the fact that the vast majority of the main story that was added or expanded in respect to the original FF7’s Midgar chapter is borderline boring and void of any significance\, made me go through this game for a long time\, because I couldn’t make myself play for longer than an hour or less a day. This is a first for an FF game for me\, as even FFXV\, which to date is my least favourite\, made me play continuously till the ending for 2 days straight.I don’t know if it’s me getting older and bitter\, or just having impossible expectations towards the Remake (and accidentally the most influential piece of any popular entertainment that is the original FF7 in my life)\, but FF7 Remake didn’t only gravely disappoint me\, it made me question my whole interest in the gaming industry at all.(The score is as it is\, because as bad a FF7 spawn this game is\, I still can recognize it as a good game on its own\, which plays nice and has great production values; however\, if you\, like me\, are approaching it from a sentimental point of view and expected something that would grow up with you since 1997\, this score is obviously way too generous).… Expand"

However\, it also\, means that there are quite a few filler side quests that probably didn't need to be in there.On the whole though the game benefits from the extra time you get to spend in Midgar.The battle system takes some getting used to but on the whole is an improvement on the original\, giving it a more immediate actiony feel. I was sceptical at first but doing some stabbing while you wait for your meter to fill up for the big attacks does work well. The only downside is that your AI companions ATB bars go up incredibly slowly when you're not controlling them so you have to switch constantly between characters to be effective.It goes without saying that the graphics\, music and voice acting is exceptional. There are occasional texture issues but they are far enough apart that it didn't affect the game for me.Overall\, this is a fantastic reimagining of arguably the best console game of all time.

Although if you played the original and loved it\, then this is not the FF7 remake we deserved. After playing the game and experiencing the new mechanics and expanded story I can say that it is ok. Simply ok. They completely changed some key points of the story\, re-worked areas to satisfy a new audience (which sacrifices the original stories impact) and made some horrible dungeons that were clearly made to pad out the game and increase game time. The dungeons are just terrible and add nothing to the story or game play. The side quests are boring\, primarily fetch quests and typical “go here and kill that”. Most of the things they added simply turned out to just pad out the game. This game should have only been 10 hours long if they removed all the unnecessary boring dungeons and side quests. And it would have been a solid and enjoyable 10 hours. The soundtrack of the original game was the heartbeat of the game and the remake just massively underplays it and creates terrible “modern” versions of it. Hopefully they will add DLC where you can select to have the original sound track play in the background instead of the new music.  Frankly after playing this game\, this should have been a shot by shot remake with added and expanded dialogue and the expanded story of the other characters.

Graphics for a PS4 game are well done sure some textures seem low res I dont know if its limits of a console or rush but they dont break you out of the game play. HDR looks great. Mini games are hard as hell. Someone said Normal is hard for no reason I personally did thing it was to hard. I did everything in the first play took about 35 hours. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to play FF7 for the first time or who played the old one.… Expand

Being a fan of SE back in the SquareSoft days\, I am trying to isolate my nostalgia with the criteria of what makes up a superb game in this genre.Visuals 1.5/2 - The game is gorgeous but with some hiccups. The first 2 chapters are pretty flawless but there there is some drop off in quality with low res textures  and pop in but still remains a smooth experience. I would say the low res textures can reduce the impact of certain scenes such as Aerith's garden being filled with low res flowers. Just don't sniff too close.Sound 1.5/2  - The music in this game is overall well done with some drawback as the recreations of tunes seemed overly thought/complex which reduced the emotional impact when delivering a scene compared to the classic tune. I think a classic tune mode would of been appreciated by fans. Environmental sounds and battle sound effects all assisted in delivering impact and grounding into the scene.Narrative/Pacing/Delivery  2.5/4 - Starting with the strengths\, they know how to deliver emotional impact though character building and delivery\, and throughout the experience\, FF7R does not bog itself down with being too serious as many lighthearted/funny moments are beautifully weaved within. The main narrative is well done with pacing issues. The side quests and much of the content between main narrative points are lacking impact\, and become dull. The main character's lip syncing is well done\, but the side characters are lacking work. I liked the expanded stories\, but didn't like the fate elements as they distracted from many impactful scenes. The trade for creative freedom brought storytelling complexity at the expense of emotional delivery.Gameplay 1/2 - SE's strongest showing of its new age combat system. Took a little to get used to\, but overall an enjoyable experience. Strategically\, I would of preferred more depth with both the battles (Mostly dodge mechanics) and the environments (Reminiscent of FFXIII hallways).6.5/10… Expand"

I did skip or didn't fully complete most minigames with the exception of Darts.Story/Characters:The story is great\, filled with likeable and deep characters not losing its grip off me for almost the entirety. It can be funny\, tense\, emotional and romantic without feeling like they are just ticking boxes. Even Stretching the Midgar arc to 30-40 hours does not harm the quality. It gripped me from the first to the final chapters.That is right until the end\, the conclusion of the story feels rushed\, messy\, and left me with even more questions - not in a good way as it gets a bit weird / off-tone to the rest of the story.Ending with the Midgar arc does mean than a lot of Cloud backstory / world lore is not fully explained. In the original FF7 this happens mostly after the (short) Midgar story arc. Without having played the original it left me quite confused with a lot of the stuff that happened in the last few hours. It also impacts smaller\, world lore bits throughout the game\, where the game expects you to understand these terms or references when they never get explained.Graphics/Audio:Graphics are great\, solid performance\, nothing to complain. Audio is great\, however there is one battle theme in the tunnels that is extremely repetitive it feels its a very short loop.Gameplay:Hands down the best active-combat final fantasy game they created so far\, it requires a lot of management to be effective and especially to be successful on hard mode. It is the ultimate fusion of the old turn based and modern active combat style. FFXV pales in comparison to FF7R.Upgrading weapons and slotting them with Materia is a very interesting system that provides a lot of freedom in building your characters. Cloud for example can pretty much fill any role you want granted you got the right Materia\, Weapons\, Armor and Accesories.The camera can be a bit of a bother at times with flying enemies.… Expand"

Also one thing that annoyed me is that we need to wait for the next chapter now\, and the last chapter with the back and forth between teams was super annoying because it doesn't give you ease of life stuff like remembering materia equipped or letting you change it during a battle which causes a lot of cheap deaths.

73864,FFVIIR,2020-05-04,0,"After a lot of thought\, I feel like this is a fair score to give this game. I don't have very high standards for games so stuff like the pacing being ruined by the slow side quests\, lack of urgency\, cheesiness and scripted walking sequences usually don't bother me too much. I didnt even mind that I had to fork out hundreds of dollars and potentially have to buy a $1000 PS5 to get the full story. I would usually give a game like this an 8 or probably even a 9 even with all of these flaws if it was enjoyable overall. The reason I am giving it a 4 is solely because of that abomination of an ending. That ending just sucks the enjoyment out of you and makes you not care as much for future titles.I should say that while I've been a longtime fan of the final fantasy series\, I was late in playing FF7 so I dont have the nostalgia goggles that many people have. I am not a purist so its not the direction that bothered me\, it was the execution. I don't understand how they could have created such a magical experience for the first 35 hours and then screwed up completely in the last 3 hours\, leaving a stain on all of their hard work.(minus 1 point) Firstly\, the characters start acting oddly\, Aerith changing from her cheerful\, confident self to a depressed\, unsure clone of Tifa. And Red XIII seems to be relegated to a mouthpiece of square\, trying to explain the nonsense they are pulling in the last 2 chapters.. They also seemed to have made him older and wiser than his original counterpart who was described as having a juvenile state of mind.(minus 1 point) Secondly\, the multiple timelines they put in were pointless additions. After you beat the whisper harbinger\, you are treated to a scene of Zack in from Crisis core. Except instead of him dying to save cloud\, you see him watching as the whispers fade from existence and he carries cloud towards midgar. He then walks past the point where cloud and aerith are leaving the city\, showing that they made it to Midgar. What was the point of this change? Is it another reality/dimension? If so\, why does it matter? Also\, didnt Zack die in the past? How would killing whispers in the present change the past? If they existed across all of time and space why didnt they just remove sephiroth from existence? And above all\, why does it matter if he is alive in an alternate dimension if its not the one the story takes place in?(minus 1 point) Thirdly\, the addition of changing fate itself at the end was just wrong. The rest of the game\, although the whispers show up\, the main theme was not changing fate. A large part of the enjoyment I got from the first 35 hours of the game was seeing the characters deal with the moral dilemma of their war with Shinra and them seeing the consequences of their actions. It had absolutely nothing to do with fate. Trying to shoehorn this in at the 11th hour was just jarring. Throughout the game the bosses have been machines or people. Then at the end of the game\, all of a sudden you fight this gigantic manifestation of fate that looks like the first boss in Kingdom Hearts 1. Its such a huge disconnect from the rest of the game.(minus 2 points) And then there is the worst part of all for me: I dont know who was responsible for this. It may not have been Nomura like everyone is crying about but\, whoever decided it was a good idea to add in arbiters of fate only to kill them at the end of the game\, signaling the death of the fanbase's expectations\, should be sacked. Whoever it was\, was trying to be a smartass towards the fans. It was the least subtle way of saying \""f*** the fans for asking us to make it faithful. We are gonna force you to kill your own expectations in the form of these arbiters of fate so we can do whatever we want now\"". If they wanted to change the story\, they should have just changed it. Sure\, it wouldn't have been what they advertised but its better than changing it and then using the whispers as a device to explain and justify their actions. This act alone was so petty and insulting I can understand why a lot of people are fuming and giving this game 0/10.Frankly\, I dont understand all of the people saying they were fans of the original and like this better. FF7 is a story driven game so you cant call the ending of the story a minor issue and give it a 10/10.This almost feels like GOT Season 8 last year. So much effort was wasted making a brilliant game that got ruined by bad writing and terrible execution at the end.Edit: Since a bunch of you felt like giving the game a 10/10 while specifically calling people who gave a low score purist fanboys\, and not giving any actual reviews I've decided to change my score from 4 to 0. A game with the sheer legacy of FF7 deserves respect towards the original and it's fanbase. This was the game that rocketed square to success. Without it there would be no final fantasy today. Without the original fans\, the remake would never have been made.… Expand"

73811,FFVIIR,2020-05-21,1,pathetic selling a new game with only a small part.Square deceived us. We fans were expecting a complete game. They spent hours in Midgard thinking only of money.How many years will we have to wait to fight the Weapon? How many more parts will the game have?I am extremely disappointed!

TheI had to log in just to Write a counter review to all the idiots who haven’t even finished the game giving it bad ratings..The game is gorgeous. The mechanics are a fantastic spin on new and old. The characters are perfect. The voice acting is almost entirely amazing. The production value is superb. The presentation is spectacular. They nailed the vibe of Midgar and FFVII in general. The music is an appropriate modern take on the Original soundtrack. The materia system is there and is just like what I’d expect a new take on the game to be. Everything is just amazing. The only actual complaints I have are the occasional camera annoyance and parts of the game have some pretty poor textures. It’s like they just forgot or didn’t have time or the hardware is limiting the game. But that’s something that will undoubtedly be patched.The detail is just incredible. This feels like a real Midgar. I never could have imagined how they would represent this city in a modern game to such high standards. If not for the poor textures in some areas it would be 10/10 and best of this generation of gaming. The little things are amazing. If you really take your time and check things out and enjoy the game\, there’s so much thought and care that went into it. They clearly wanted to make the best final fantasy game ever here. And if the rest of the games add up\, then they will succeed. Because this is freaking superb.Now about the people rating this 0 or 5 or really anything less than 7: They are either butthurt mega fans that can’t stand anything being different from the original\, or they are Idiots who can’t understand the concept of a remake and how much different it is going to be from a 23 year old game... This isn’t a remaster. It’s not the exact same game with modern graphics. It’s a REMAKEof the FFVII story and universe. You know\, like as in it’s not a remaster... It’s a full blown game by itself. Even being only a part of the whole story\, it’s still far better than most any game out there. Its a shame that some people can’t comprehend how impossible it would be to shove the entire original story into this kind of format. This remake is as good as we ever could have hoped for.Yes\, the game and story are different to some degree. But that’s because it HAS to be... The original was a radically different era. Just designing and rendering all of these areas in Midgar would be an insane amount of work. To build in all the story elements\, have virtually seamless cutscene transition to in-game rendering\, all the voice acing and animations and battle mechanics and all that... It’s an accomplishment just for this first part of the FFVII story. If you’re unhappy that they didn’t deliver the whole story\, that’s understandable. Nobody wants to wait. If you’re rating the game a 0 or 5 because of that\, or because everything isn’t exactly the same as a 23 year old game\, you’re an idiot or a troll.This game is definitely a 9/10 or above. If not for the texture gaffs and an imperfect camera\, this is a perfect game in my book.We all knew this would happen with this game. There’s going to be idiots and trolls out there. It’s absurd to rate such a wonderful piece of work so low. A real 5/10 or even 0/10 game is so far from this it’s not even funny. They didn’t screw this up at all. It’s a modern\, fleshed out version of the FFVII universe as a modern game. All the important bits are there. All the iconic areas and events aside from some changes that were necessary to bring a 23 year old game to modern times. This is everything we could have hoped for. I am already sad that we must wait for part 2. But it is what it is. When it’s all done it will undoubtedly be a video game masterpiece that will hold up for decades to come.Just don’t get turned off because al these trolls and people who can’t understand why something is different after 23 years. The core story isn’t going to change. The journey changed because now we can experience so much more than we could back when the whole game was just some text in different scenes and a whole lot of random battles. This game still has all those main events\, plus some more and a whole lot more in between. For once\, I agree with the overall critic rating. It’s at least an 87 and I’m pretty sure it would be in the 90’s if it weren’t for some weirdly bad textures. I saw some reviews taking about it making it sound like the whole game is bad. It’s not. The entire first few hours is incredible. I’m here playing on my OLED in HDR on my PS4 PRO and it’s gorgeous.Buy it. Play it. Don’t expect the exact same damn game as the original. It is the same story and al that. They just baked in some of the extended FFVII content in. That’s not a bad thing.… Expand"

73814,FFVIIR,2020-04-17,3,"There are certainly some good things about Final Fantasy VII Remake like the visuals and some of the mechanics but overall i found it disappointing.  First off the claim that this is a full Final Fantasy game is not accurate.   If I were to complete most of the original games content it would probably take around 100 hours of game play while the remake\, including side quests\, took me about 50 hours of gameplay.  Secondly the decision to keep the game completely in Midgar is\, simply put\, baffling.  In the original Midgar is basically a tutorial that takes about 7 hours to complete.  Some of the scenes in the remake feel unnecessarily drawn out and exhaustive.  This would have been fine if they were adding to and enhancing the original story line but most of the time they weren't.  Although you see Sephiroth quite a bit in this new game he doesn't add much to the plot.  He rarely speaks and when he does it doesn't have much meaning.  I don't recall hearing him ever talk about his mission of finding the promised land!  The remake seemed even more linear than the original and often forces you to take a certain path and there's no need for that.  But one of the most disappointing things about the remake is the ending.  It is an attempt to be this epic conclusion but it just ends up being a convoluted mess that doesn't make much sense.  It also has nothing to do with the original and almost makes you feel like you have completed the entire story line without any further installments needed.  In summary i would call this Final Fantasy 7 reimagined\, not a remake.  It plays out like someones interpretive blockbuster movie not like the RPG we know and love.… Expand"

73820,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,9,"With the hype surrounding this game second only to the return of Jesus\, FF VII Remake had such lofty expectations that there was no way it was ever going to fulfill them. However the game comes about as close as I could have expected it too. I first want to say that people who expect this to be the whole game remade need to rethink how they view this game. They really should have addedWith the hype surrounding this game second only to the return of Jesus\, FF VII Remake had such lofty expectations that there was no way it was ever going to fulfill them. However the game comes about as close as I could have expected it too. I first want to say that people who expect this to be the whole game remade need to rethink how they view this game. They really should have added some sort of Part 1 subtitle to this so people know that this isn't the full game.What this game gets right\, gets those things extremely right. The level of detail and atmosphere here is astounding. I don't think I've ever seen some of the attention to detail presented here in any other game ever made. The staff treated each character and setting with extreme care. It really shows in how the characters interact with each other and the environment around them. As well as the subtle nods to old fans of the series with the various flash-forward sequences that show what the player knows happens after Midgar ends and the rest of the game begins. The new content is also very well done and\, while some of it can feel a bit prolonged at times\, it all fits into the story very well as well as gives some of the characters from the original game\, who may not have been given the time to develop as a character\, their own time to shine here. If this is going to be the level set for all of the following games\, then the amount of detail here will be staggering.However not everything here works well in the long run. The combat can be hit or miss\, especially during the final portions of the game where it expects you to be able to read each enemy like the back of your hand if you want to survive. Especially on the hardest difficulties. The combat in general is a mixed bag. On one hand I like how it all fits together and flows at times\, and on the other it can be extremely frustrating when you get 1 shot by an enemy you cant see on screen while at max health. It can feel very cheap at times. Also the voice acting can be a bit wonky at times. 95% of the time\, all the VO's are great and each character is very well realized throughout the story. But certain characters\, like Tifa and Aerith\, will deliver some very deadpan and unenthusiastic lines during high pressure situations. It's a fairly minor thing\, and doesn't happen a lot\, but happens enough to make it noticeable and can take you out of scene.As I said before\, this game was never going to live up to the massive amounts of hype that came with it. But it does a very good job at coming close. And out of the about 40 hours it'll take to complete this game\, not including going back to do the trophies or side quests you will miss along the way\, I never felt like I was just trying to grind through it. This is something I can recommend for new and old players alike as it feels like a brand new experience and one that I'm excited to see what they do with in the future.… Expand"

That sucks imo..Especially if Tetsuya Nomura is rewriting FF7. Other than that there's so much in this game that really pissed me off.This game had some real pacing issues. Its obvious they tried to pad out the length to make the game worth the price(which i expected) but when you add pointless uninspired side quests you just end up ruining the pace of the game. Would have been ok with a 20 hour game if they told the story in a satisfying way. A good example of how pad the game with meaningful content is the Mad Rush chapter\, that was a great chapter that expanded the story of the Avalanche crew. I had hoped the extra padding on the game would have meaningful content instead of side-quests that have you chasing a stupid thief or finding some stupid kids.The ending was bloated and convoluted like a KH game. Like you already had the perfect story why would you choose to make it more complicated?It's obvious who the people that worked on the game were fans of Tifa. She got way too many sections dedicated to her which would be fine\, but they didnt show that same attention to my favorite character which is Barret. He got one small section in the shira underground lab and thats it. He didnt even participate in the Whipser Bahumut and Jenova fight because they conveniently wrote him out. Like come on man not everyone is a fan of Tifa or Aerith. Barret got the short end of the stick\, like make it even or just keep things as they were.Tifa was bland.The sound mixing is pretty awful in some sections. Like why can't i hear the main character over some random NPC saying the same line on repeat. Why can't i hear Rude over the helicopter?Tetsuya Nemura should never direct or write another FF. His style is now obvious to me and after this '\""remake\"" and the terrible KH3 I know that this man is not a good director of games\, excellent character artist but should not be in charge of directing a beloved game series.The Shira building section which was probably the best part of the original\, In the remake tho it was so lame. If they were going to expand on anything in the game\, this section was where i wanted to see more interesting interactions with the characters.Chapter 10 - 11 are boring\, could have been 1 chapter.Alot of the new NPC's were so lame\, except for maybe the Speed Demon.You not only see Sephiroth through out the game but you fight him in the end? They sincerely ruined the best villain in gaming history by blowing their loads too early.There's plenty more but im just too heart broken to continue. I dont think i will ever need to replay this game. Im gonna just consider this game a prequel to Advent Children instead of a direct remake to the original FF7.

What I loved was getting to know members of Avalanche better and seeing more of the behind the scenes at Shinra. You could tell that SquareEnix had been laying the groundwork for Remake for more than 15 years\, and I feel it's payed off.This is definitely a part one. My first time through took me about 40 hours to complete on the easier setting. Going to try the other difficulties and keep working on new strategies and work on completion to get all of the materia and gear I missed the first time around.If you liked the original\, you should definitely try this game.

Don't forget the original FF14 release was a sin against mmoprgs. They were not confident they could live up to their past accolades. And here we are; proven they were right.As far as pure graphics go\, the game is beautiful - which is what we expect from square-enix now.The new battle system is very interesting and should be applauded.Just about everything else is substandard. The voice sync is the worst I've seen seen voice sync has been attempted..... The music scores are good\, but very rarely are implemented well. More than a few times our eco-terrorist group are talking or planning something and you have a some melodic romance movie type song going on.... and you can only wonder **** WHY.There are few times when your team are performing one of their missions and the script and story writing feel like its a couple of middle schoolers going to the convenience store where they will battle a few pokemon trainers.... but in reality they are raiding a military base and murdering guards by the dozens.......Also its outright insane in some of the cinematics and scenario battles how Cloud is either recognized as a scary **** or he's a random nobody\, and for either route enemies will always just aim their guns at him and tell him to stop! They are theoretically standing in the corpses of DOZENS of their fellow coworkers...... like wtf.This entire game took up around 11% of the original plot of FF7 and padded it full of insane child like garbage.

So my review is just based on how I like this game not to do with anything from the past.Honestly for me this game is a mixed bag\, I like the characters\, the story can be at times very engaging\, it can be a little humorous\, the combat I think is reasonably good some parts not so great. I have a couple big gripes\, first of all Im about half way through chapter 13 so i think thats about 3/4 of the way though and its been nothing but corridors\, a couple small towns with a scratch of freedom\, but I was really hoping this wasnt going to go down the ff13 route but it did. The problem is with only corridors\, so many materia to upgrade\, so many levels\, weapons\, abilities what this game desperately needs is some areas for grinding out some levels somewhere fun and interesting to explore but if you wanna grind in this game youll just find yourself running up and down the same corridors over and over or running round the same few spots in a scrapyard over and over fighting the same tiny handful of monsters over and over\, this is not a game for grinders or explorers which is the two things i used to love about ff games the most. credit where credits due the boss fights are pretty fun mostly.When it comes to the combat I quite enjoyed it to begin with but as the game progresses I feel it starts to fall off the camera becomes a little wild in tight spaces so trying to look at who you want to attack becomes incredibly annoying at times\, you could get around this be using target lock but the problem with that is it locks your camera angle too because the button that would move the angle actually selects another target\, so many times ive been reigning down on a pressured enemy but i want to move the camera to see what the other 5 enemies are doing and in trying to move the camera i forget im on target lock my target swings to an enemy half way across the area and my character leaps away from the enemy we were piling on completely interrupting the flow very frustrating at times.I wont add much more the side content is ok not massively engaging\, the minigames can be fun\, i like whack a box. Overall it has good things going for it but other times its quite bland and repetitive\, I was really hoping to get a bit more from this game\, but it looks like the days where final fantasy games were about exploration and interesting and varied ways to grind out and power up your characters has past\, if like me thats what youre looking for you will likely be a bit disappointed\, if youre looking for story driven point to point action you might fare a little better.… Expand"

The recreation of the original music is fantastic. Some of the new music is a bit too generic\, but it's still high quality. The new fighting system is really fantastic. A wonderful synthesis of new and old that combines perfectly with both tactical elements from the original with mechanical elements that keep you moving. I had lost faith in JRPG combat systems of late that just seemed to have become a slog but this system is just right. Boss variety  keeps things fresh and requires genuine thought at times instead of just mindless button mashing. The graphics are really flawless for the most part... how on earth are the characters somehow just as I imagined them to be when I  was just looking at fan fiction and low polygon models before? That opening sequences... wow. Unfortunately there are exceptions to this with some low quality textures like the slums from above or the plates from below. I mean really\, why wasn't there care put into them? One thing that I'm not sure is really a flaw but might not be for everyone is the cheesy acting. It kind of makes it hard to engage with the story at times\, but then again\, its quite possilbe that its just a faithful realisation of the text. However... it doesn't really come across well with voice acting. They could have toned it down a little. There is a certain amount of padding in the game but it isn't over the top and it tends to teach you something about the world in general. However\, somehow it can feel a bit generic at times. Oh and I loved the mini-games :). They are silly but a nice distraction. All in all\, top quality stuff. You can see the genius of the original game shine through in (almost) all its glory.… Expand"

I found the combat to be such a chore that I don't think that I will finish the other parts once they come out with how poor the combat is now. trying to imagine all the bosses and parts from the original in the new combat system seems like a very grindy chore and not one that would be worth mashing buttons for. Also having enemies you cant even hit with certain characters is one of the most annoying and outright stupid thing i have encountered yet. yes lets have an enemy that can just shoot from the sky and kill your chars while the ones on the ground are bashing you over and over till you cant potion anymore and you die. I don't believe almost any of the reviews here that gave it anything over a 7 played the original at all.

73935,FFVIIR,2020-07-07,9,"Going forward\, I will be rating each aspect of the game in its own category.Story – 9/10\nOverall\, the story of the game it is based on has been very faithfully recreated\, improving some of the already existing lore and adding to it with new story elements that get sprinkled in throughout the course of the game in various ways. These become a bigger part of the main narrative theGoing forward\, I will be rating each aspect of the game in its own category.Story – 9/10Overall\, the story of the game it is based on has been very faithfully recreated\, improving some of the already existing lore and adding to it with new story elements that get sprinkled in throughout the course of the game in various ways. These become a bigger part of the main narrative the further you progress.Some people like the new story elements\, and some people don't\, but we'll have to wait for the future installments to see if the story they have set up plays out like the masterpiece it has the potential to be.Characters – 10/10They absolutely nailed on that front! They all have unique personalities and traits to them. The relationships between the main characters keep developing over time\, growing from a mere work-related collaboration to a bond of companionship. In my opinion\, the main characters we have met thus far are even better than they were in the original game.Also\, the dialogs between characters feel much more realistic than your typical „video gamey“ style of talking to each other.Combat – 9/10The combat system in this game combines the classic ATB system (you can use commands like Attack or Magic you get from Materia once the bar has filled up) with more action-heavy combat like in Final Fantasy XV.It takes the best of both worlds and gives you fast-paced fights that require tactical thinking.On top of that you have the ability to call one Summon per battle and have it fight by your side!The only gripes I have with it are bad cameras while fighting\, the air-combat \, ATB and Limit gauges getting reset when you use abilities at the wrong moment and the forced boss phase transitions that cancel your queued up attacks.Character Progression - 9/10The fundamentals of RPG character progression also apply to this game. You level up and therefore increase your stats by defeating enemies and get new\, more powerful weapons to boost your strength in battle. Yet\, some of these mechanics work a bit differently than they do in other games.You will get access to more weapons the further you progress through the game. Unlike in other RPGs where you just replace your current weapon once you get a new one and never use the previous one again\, you gain points when your character levels up. You can use these points to level up your weapons alongside your character.Then there's also the Materia system that can alter the Magic you cast\, the Summons you call forth\, the Abilities you use and even grant you status boosts. Trying various ways to combine them with each other allows you to approach fights in a lot of different ways.Music - 10/10Oh my god\, the music in this game! They've done a great job masterfully recreating tracks from the original and creating completely new arrangements.Worldbuilding - 10/10Midgar is a living and breathing city that has so much personality. Almost every NPC has a unique voice and when progressing through the story\, each NPC changes their dialog according to events that recently transpired. The same also goes for the environment that changes during the course of the game.Graphics - 9/10It probably comes to no surprise that FFVIIR has absolutely amazing visuals\, be it the breathtaking environments\, the way Tactical Mode slows down the action during combat or Cloud's perfectly styled hair. The dynamic lighting in FFVIIR also looks impressive and makes for some cool effects.The only reason I'm not giving it a perfect score in terms of graphics is that there are a few places in the game that have some serious issues with textures not loading in correctly.Level Design - 6/10The Level Design is probably the weakest aspect of this game\, as a majority of areas you have to go through consist of linear paths (even though these areas do look pretty good).Optional content - 8/10There is a decent amount of Sidequests in certain Chapters. Quality-wise\, they aren't the best of the best for the most part\, but not that bad either and some of them are actually pretty good.On the other hand\, the really good optional content comes in the form of Battle Intel reports\, VR battles and especially the Hard Mode difficulty in New Game+.There’s also a couple of fun Minigames that you can do to kill some time and get neat rewards!Total score - 9/10This game has been a love letter to the original game and is even amazing without any attachment to the 1997 classic.It was an insane rollercoaster of emotions and if I were to include my nostalgia-bias I would have given it a 15/10\, but since I’m doing a critical review here and the game does have some flaws\, I will settle with a 9/10 score and can only recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested in the genre.… Expand"

I didn't mind the ending\, but players would find themselves suddenly thrust into a story change that requires you to play FF7 original\, Crisis Core\, Dirge of Cerberus and watch Advent Children to make any sense of.What I can say about this game though:CHARACTERS - the characters have been fleshed out far beyond my expectation and for the first time I enjoyed actually playing Tifa and Barrett (characters that I never used in the original FF7) and how they bounce off each other and have different personality quirks. Aeriths personality has been significantly developed and hearkens to the FF7 Japanese Version of Aerith\, which is this fun\, bubbly\, confident and caring young woman.MUSIC - The music is mind blowing\, emotional and beautiful. When I heard Nobuo Uematsu was coming back to work on this game I knew we were in for a treat. Not only does the soundtrack inspire the feeling from the original score\, brought into the 21st century\, but the mixing of the music within the game from exploration to battle is flawless.SCENERY - You feel like you are living and breathing in Midgar and the remake is incredibly faithful to the original\, just built upon even further. There are some issues with graphics that look a bit shoddy\, i.e. when you look down at the slums from atop the Midgar plate\, and the VERY detailed characters can often look strange against the barely textured walls and props. Also a weird note aside\, but I don't like that when the character runs through scenery\, objects bounce off them like nothing; for example Cloud when running through Sector 7 can send steel girders flying\, which slightly ruins immersion.BATTLE SYSTEM - The blend of ATB and button controls to dodge and switch between characters is fun\, refreshing and exhilarating. The battles in this game made me sweat\, not only do you have to think strategically about your next moves\, but you have to execute them well too\, by making sure your button presses\, timing and positioning are in sync. I cannot wait for the WEAPON Battles....All in all\, I was so worried about the FF7 Remake\, I don't know how they could top the original\, but so far to my delight they have.

But look at what they gave us\, a real life look at Midgar! This has been one of the best gaming experience I have gotten\, but there are flaws here and there\, mainly just texture loading which I think can be easily solved with the PS5 with subsequent parts of the Remake\, as well as the dialogue at some parts there was one side mission in Sector 5 with the old man\, the ending of that mission was with the old man mad at us but then Aerith talks to you and says \""Isn't it great helping people?\"" so maybe they can improve that in the next parts. Now to talk about the elephant in the room\, the ending\, I understand those who didn't like it but it is called a 'Remake' for a reason and that reason is to re-imagine the story of the game\, I think we should have faith in them I mean the scenario writer is still Nojima which is the same with the original. I personally liked the ending but if some didn't really like the ending\, well that's fine but you might not want to buy the next parts now knowing what they're doing with the series.

73970,FFVIIR,2020-11-16,0,"I have been looking forward to this game for a long time but I was blown away by how badly Square screwed this remake.  I completed the platinum so it's not for lack of trying to like the game.1. The game can't decide if it's a action or rpg game.  So it decided to be a movie.2. We were told that they were only releasing the first disk because we'd get to explore Midgar.  There are 8 sections to Midgar\, we explored the same 3 timy sections as the original so no new areas were added.3. There was no exploring of any kind.  The few times the game opened up to allow you to explore it was done in the most cookie cutter manner imaginable.4. The magic system was hard capped to add a fake level of difficulty.  You can reach 9999 HP but 2x MP up resulted in around 200MP for most users.5. Hard mode removed items all together and wouldn't let you easily regen magic.  This kind of artificial difficulty to a hard mode is pathetic.6. For some reason Square forgot in both this game and 15 that they had this nice thing called the Gambit system since FF12.  By not including the gambit system the extra characters are pretty much useless in most fights unless you keep switching between them.  Given that this is no longer a turn based game switching between characters was cumbersom.7.  The final battle of the game was a ripoff of Advent Children.  Once the wing came out I was so pissed that I still had a hard mode playthrough to cleanup for the plat.8. The game was 80% padding with one to many unskippable conversations.9.  A good part of the games maps were setup so you could walk/listen to story or have you squeeze between something just long enough for the next area to load.  The levels were so tiny and boring it was pathetic.Overall I'm so dissapointed with this game that I am officially done with Square.  I've played every FF since I was a kid in the 80's and this is one of the biggest cash grabs I've ever seen from a company riding the coat tails of IP from when it was a functional studio.To add insult to injury when is part 2 coming out?

Ogni tanto si sente che determinate sezioni di gioco siano state allungate parecchio rispetto all'originale\, ma non risulta essere un difetto considerando che il titolo (venduto a prezzo pieno) deve presentare tutte le caratteristiche di un gioco completo di circa 30/40 ore di gioco. La struttura di gioco resta comunque molto lineare\, ma non per questo mancano le chicche opzionali\, squisitamente JRPG.I numerosi personaggi hanno avuto molto più spazio che nell'originale per ps1. I membri dell'Avalanche per esempio sono resi molto più \""umani\"" e in generale l'estetica di gioco ha permesso che le emozioni dei vari personaggi venissero fuori in modo naturale e toccante.Il game play farà sicuramente scuola nello saturo panorama JRPG che raramente ha potuto vantare un ibrido tanto interessante. Si può adottare un approccio prettamente action ma la difficoltà (nella media rispetto agli standard) spinge ad utilizzare le pause tattiche per adottare strategie più complesse che rendono soddisfacente i scontri più concitati (che sono molti). Rispetto al quindicesimo capitolo della saga\, qui il game over è molto più temibile se non si studia con attenzione il proprio equipaggiamento\, soprattutto le materia. Le armi offrono approcci diversi allo scontro e possono essere customizzate in base alle proprie preferenze. In generale il gameplay è uno dei punti di forza del titolo\, che mostra il meglio di sé nelle numerose bossfight. Durante tutto il gioco non sarà possibile utilizzare un party di più 3 personaggi giocabili\, anche quando tutti i personaggi saranno nello stesso posto. Di questo problema ne risente soprattutto Red Xiii\, che fungerà da personaggio di supporto non giocabile\, sembrando inconsistente rispetto agli altri membri del party\, anche dal punto di vista narrativo.Il comparto audio visivo è di grande qualità\, soprattutto la gestione delle luci\, dei dettagli ambientali e degli NPC\, che rendono vivi i luoghi esplorati\, nonostante certe volte sembrino un po' anonimi nel character design.Alcuni sfondi risultano sfocati e stonano parecchio con la minuzia con cui è curata l'ambientazione; inoltre a causa di alcuni bug\, certi poligoni presentano texture non caricate che fanno storcere parecchio il naso\, pur non influenzando troppo l'esperienza di gioco.La soundtrack del grandissimo Nobu Uematsu è una delle migliori che abbia mai ascoltato. Presenta una carrellata di brani che possono essere distinti in perfetti riarrangiamenti di musiche originali e nuove interessanti produzioni\, come la bellissima \""Hollow\"".Un difetto degno di nota riguarda la gestione della narrativa e delle bossfight nella parte finale di gioco. Nel tentativo di sorprendere i giocatori e \""giustificare\"" il carattere stand alone di questi primo episodio\, sono state apportate delle modifiche sul finale che\, per quanto interessanti come forma di meta narrativa\, hanno anticipato certe bossfight (o comunque l'impatto che ne sarebbe derivato) in modo non necessario\, tradendo una certa paura nel non riuscire a completare i prossimi episodi. In breve sembra che Nomura abbia messo le mani avanti lasciando intendere che se non fossero riusciti finire il progetto ff7 Remake\, almeno avrebbero lasciato un primo capitolo che a livello di bossfight avrebbe \""chiuso il cerchio\"".Nel complesso il gioco rimane un piccolo capolavoro che se manterrà questo standard qualitativo per i prossimi episodi\, potrà dare nuova vita alla saga di Final Fantasy. 8\,75/10… Expand"

It has the story elements of the original but even then the story falls far from the real story. (in this case\, I would rate this game 7.5/10 if they would just completely remove chapters 17 & 18 from the game\, but I get to that later.)This is a PG 3 game that has a PG 16 rating\, the amount of hand holding even till the end is extremely annoying. Not only does camera ALWAYS show you where to go with fixed angle. Your NPCs tell you multiple times where you need to go or what to do. You literally cannot go wrong way because of \""Cloud don't go there\"".Even the quest where you need to find undercover dude with password the quest marker literally is on his head all the time\, there is no possibility to miss him or even wonder. This game seems to assume that you are literally so stupid that you cannot find even bathroom on your own\, it's really off putting when game thinks i'm retarded. When game does this\, I'm like no **** is that really the way to go\, who would have thought.This game has too many benches that allow you to restore hp/mp full. Its harder to run out of mp between fights than to consume it all since sometimes you have bench literally after every other fight.I'll rope hard mode into this. in hard mode you cannot use items\, but benches are still there\, tho this time they only restore hp. I find this to be really stupid way of doing things\, I didn't have any problems with hard mode\, this just shifted my combat almost completely from materias to skills which didn't make any other difference than made combat more boring to me.I rather they removed the benches completely and let us use those items we collected in normal mode. After I hit hard mode I sold all items\, since I used less than 10 of them combined truout the whole game before that anyway.Also I personally dislike hard mode exclusive items/skillpoint books. I think these should be obtainable even on normal but if you want to get multiple of the same items then you should be able to farm them on hard\, or something like this. Looking at you secret battle.Visuals: 9/10Would have 10/10 but I keep getting distracted by doors and floors that look like they are copied from the original game.Movement: 8/10Personally I find it annoying that character starts circling around when you try to just move sideways a little. Also 5/10 for all those damn forced to wall near quest characters/objects\, really annoying in some parts when you just wanna walk.Music: 10/10Absolutely fantastic music.Combat: 6.5/10The combat mechanics are really good in general. I personally didn't like how summons work\, but I still think they are fine nontheless.Your chars gets interrupted little too easily while casting or using skills and even tho you wouldn't have cast or attacked yet you still lose mp and action.Limit breaks are absolutely worst part of the combat. The fact that you can die\, get interrupted or enemy moves a little so you hit empty corner during limit is really stupid. it also doesn't re-target a different enemy if the original dies. Don't get me wrong\, they look nice and hit nicely when they work\, but they should work like summon so that the rest of the game pauses till you have done limit.These are the main breaking points of combat for me. There are some other minor things but if they fixed limits and losing actions for nothing I would rate combat 9/10.Characters/character development: 8/10I love all other characters but Aerith in this game. Well-written\, they seem to have their own stuff and seem natural. Aerith is written as annoying and out-of-place too often. For an instance\, who talks about themself like \""Since I'm so generous\, I...\"" and this is not even sarcastic remark\, since she actually does those things.Cloud character develops much faster into friendly soldier than in original which I don't like that much but its not that big of a turn off. And for some reason his mercenary side is played off as a joke towards end.Story: 0/10Here I will say that til chapter 17 I think writing was mostly good so I would give it 8/10.After that story went full StarWars part 8 in writing. Most things make no sense even with this games plot\, not to mention original FF7 plot. I shall not spoil it\, but that is mostly since I would need about 20000 more characters to point out all of the plot holes and points that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. As a fan of original FF7 with thousands of hours into it\, this was more like spit to the face than anything else.Overall phasing of the game is good imo\, but in the end the phasing goes from 0 to 1000 in 3 seconds which made it even worse. This game is the JRPG meme \""find a kitten then kill a god\"" the problem is that they skip everything in between.… Expand"

On top of that\, the game has the best combat system of any Final Fantasy game. This game even manages to bring back the emotions I had while playing the original FF7\, beyond simple nostalgia.

It's not until you play Hard mode that creative and tactical thinking is essential. Inviting intense challenge while avoiding beating you over the head with it is one spot where FF VII R truly shines. My only complaint was the lack of usefully enemy skills but not even enough to take off a full point.  9.5/10ATMOSPHERE: It took me so long to finish this game because I would find myself soaking in the striking scenery until I eventually forced myself to move on. The aftermath of the assault on Mako reactor 1\, the Sector 7 Slums\, the Shinra building exterior\, and so much more left me in awe. 10/10CHARACTERS: It's FF VII vastly expanded. You delve into the relationships between members of Avalanche\, something the original sadly did not include. 99% of the voice actors feel natural as their character although Square has always had problems with awkward NPC dialogue and random anime grunting but that's not something I can hold the VAs accountable for. Characters hold true to their original personalities but then they do happen to move beyond that\, it's done very well\, especially with Aerith. 9/10PLOT: This was the most divisive element of the game. Some people wanted a true retelling of FF VII (up to the end of Midgar) and not many fans were expecting a pretty severe divergence towards the end. After giving it some thought\, I am fine with either way. I would have enjoyed the original story by now I am extremely excited (but also a little concerned) to see where we go from here. 8/10… Expand"

It's the same Midgar I grew up with\, the same characters I grew up with\, all of it is just how it should be\, but modernized. The combat is really fun\, I played in the action mode\, with default settings and it was difficult enough that I felt like I was being challenged on bosses and harder quest enemies\, but not so hard I wanted to launch the controller at the TV.The characters and voice acting is spot on with everything\, there were a few characters I was worried about (I'm looking at you Barret) because of the scenes they used from him in the promotional material\, but after finishing the remake\, I can easily say he was probably the character I fell in love with the hardest. Everyone feels very real\, if that makes sense\, they all have their own personalities that have been expanded since the last game\, and the acting is perfect for everyone.The additions that are exclusive to the remake such as a couple of characters\, and where the story diverges from the original are actually very good\, it keeps the game interesting\, as it's something new now\, but it still feels very nostalgic.My only real regret is it was over far too soon. The original FF7 was a 100 hour game in my mind\, I finished this game with 32 hours on the clock\, and I'd done pretty much everything I could in the game.

74015,FFVIIR,2020-06-19,9,"Square Enix made a mistake making the game Midgar-only.  There's only so much they could expand upon to make a truly unforgettable experience.  With that being said\, they made the absolute most out of what they were given without ruining it with filler content and unnecessary missions (excluding Chapter 14).Everything but that one chapter and the ending feels natural and unforced.  As for the ending\, this is what keeps the game from a 10 for me.  THIS GAME DID NOT NEED ALTERNATE TIMELINES.  IT DID NOT NEED A SEPHIROTH FIGHT.  IT DID NOT NEED SEPHIROTH SHOWING UP EVERY OTHER CHAPTER.  Part of what made him such a good villain in 1997 was his buildup.  The entirety of the Midgar section portrayed him as nearly a God.  A legend.  This man shows up in the beginning of Chapter 2 in the Remake.  Plus\, you beat him.  It takes away that fear and intimidation.Take the Midgar Zolom from the original.  You're fresh out of Midgar\, and immediately presented with this giant snake that you can NOT beat at that point in the game.  Once you get passed the swamp\, you see another one impaled on a tree by Sephiroth like it was nothing.  That made the man scary.  Whereas in Part 2 of the Remake\, it will be a \""oh\, he did a thing\, whatever\"" moment.I'm not even going to get into the Whispers and destiny being changed\, that's all in the air.  Square had a chance to remake their most beloved game of all time.  They did a phenomenal job despite my criticism\, and did everything they needed to do.

I was incredibly excited. However\, that excitement was tempered by dread that one of my favorite games (favorite stories\, for that matter) would be modernized\, butchered or disrespected as seems to be the case with so many remakes and reboots.Upon completing the game several times to cement my opinion\, I am happy to say it's excellent. Is it as good as the original game? In my humble opinion\, no. But how many remakes can say they are? Some\, but not many.I'm sure there are many reviews to be watched or read that thoroughly break down each aspect of the game and its history to make their point\, so I won't do the same here. I'll just break down some of the broader pieces of the game and my opinions on them.Combat: Square Enix spent a lot of time trying to perfect the way this game plays and I think it shows. The battle system is exactly what you would imagine if the original Final Fantasy VII was turned into an action RPG. Each weapon collected has a skill tree and unique abilities that keep combat fresh and make progression truly rewarding. Each character also plays completely differently which adds another layer of complexity and strategy that keeps your interest throughout the entirety of the game. The materia system returned and is\, in most ways\, the same as the original with the main difference being that real time combat necessitates some of the materia works a little differently. I can't wait to see how this is expanded upon in future installments.The World: Midgar was translated so beautifully into this game. From the Mako Reactors\, to the Sector 7 Slums\, to Wall Market\, everything was translated so faithfully and really made me feel like I was there. Having a camera that you can use to look around areas which\, in the original\, were limited by a fixed view\, really made locations like Aerith's house or Don Corneo's mansion so much more immersive. In the original\, Midgar was a rather linear place without a lot of ways to explore it. But the remake opens it up and fills it with side quests and new characters and story elements that make it feel more alive and less linear.The Story: One thing I was struck by in this game at first were the subtle differences in the way events played out. Overall\, it's a very faithful\, and very respectful\, translation of the original. The characters are faithfully represented. Cloud is still the wannabe-cool hero. Barret has a tough exterior\, but also a heart of gold. Hojo is still... Hojo. And all of the familiar beats of the story are there and presented in a way that respects the original game. But it distinguishes itself with those aforementioned subtle changes. If you're a fan of the original\, you will absolutely pick up on those. You'll wonder\, \""Why did it happen this way instead?\"" And you'll get your answer. But I don't do spoilers\, so I won't get into it. I'll just say\, the story was the part I was most concerned about when it came to a remake of this game. But I walked away very happy with a faithful rendition of the original\, with some interesting new content that I feel was vital to keep fans of the original Final Fantasy VII engaged.In summary\, I adored this game and am happy to have it in my collection. I look forward to seeing where we go in subsequent installments. I give this game a 10/10.… Expand"

I saw E3\, and it was just okay to me until I played demo of FF7RE. The demo was great and it was sensational to me. I always buy package to keep it\, but I was late. Therefore\, I purchased DL version as exception.Overall\, the game was not perfect. Very minor but agree with other players - Had famous texture bug with unreal engine 4. Not super excited side quests. Unfamiliar (Unfriendly?) story telling to new users.However\, the game has much more PRO than CON - Crazy awesome sound tracks. Battle system was master piece. Stunning Characters. Big change of story lines. Great atmosphere and fan services. Multiple user selections.Characters: 10 / 10Very happy to see Cloud\, Tifa\, and Aerith with enhanced graphic. I could see their face expression! Which we couldn't see from original FF7! Also their character setting was perfect cut from compilation of Final Fantasy 7. They've fully understand their characters and they combined it very nicely.Story: 10 / 10This is one of the hardest choice to users and Square/Enix. If the story is same\, user will complain about partial game sales. But clearly impossible to put all the original contents to one disc. Therefore\, they called it as remake. Not remaster. This is very challenge to Square/Enix\, and I think they did well as first step. Now we all don't know the future story. I really hope they don't ruin it.In addition\, side Quest was off (except chapter 4) but much better than FF15! I was able to see the improvement. Small rewards from side quests were also worth it. And leave it as player's choices!Music: 10 / 10Best game music of all time. Great Boss battle musics. Great Jazz Juke box musics. Great character and atmosphere musics. Ending music was sensational. Very memoriable and unique.Game Play: 10 / 10Awesome cutscenes. Great balance between battle and adventure. Texture and full voices were matched very well. Didn't get bored at all since I couldn't stop watch beautiful game/characters.At the ending credit\, I realized I was in final fantasy. Just like title.Battle System: 10 / 10Very unique style. It seemed like real-time battle like dark-soul\, but it combined thoughtfully with turn based RPG (ATB system). Different pattern of BOSS fights and many enemies! I hope we have more VR missions!I got old and busy with work and family\, so I lost my interest in video game. However\, this game bring my game spirit back!I loved this game. I got my platinum trophy. I bought packaged version to keep it as well\, and ready to play with PlayStation 5.At last\, how hard to make sequel or remake? We've seen other movies\, drama and games that how hard it is. We all know how bad it can be. However\, FF7RE had great start. It can be better and has potential to be the greatest game of all time\, just like original.… Expand"

This is my first Final Fantasy game ever and a lot of people were saying the original was good to start on so when I saw this revealed I figured I’d wait for this but after research it’s not the exact same like with the whispers and stuff. I would recommend this game it’s amazing if you want a JRPG this is perfect start with amazing story\, (with granted a bit of filler) great gameplay especially since it plays a lot like an action game (and no you don’t have to micro manage the AI on your team they’re pretty smart) and amazing voice acting.

He seems as though he would fit perfectly in Advent Children\, with his bombastic and overly anime portrayal in a game that otherwise plays rather conservatively\, holding back the desire to Naruto/Kingdom Hearts the FF franchise.  The voice acting is\, overall\, well done - with a few moments that don't quite land.The ending opens up potentially dangerous territory for what the future installments may hold.

Playable and graphically it's outstanding (except for the popping in some textures and the camera during fighting in small spaces). But what gives the suspense without a doubt are the plot changes that not only influence this chapter that concerns us but will also affect the following chapters. We all like the story of the original game and absolutely nobody has asked for events to change\, I do not consider myself a purist and I would have tolerated certain changes\, but this is too much\, in an RPG the story is a fundamental pillar and add time travel \, premonitions and resurrections makes it a cheap story worthy of a B-movie\, in short\, the game is overflowing with fanservice from all sides in an uncontrolled way. They had it very easy\, they just had to repeat what they did 23 years ago with current technology\, that was the only thing we asked for and we found a first part that is only faithful to the original during the first hours of the game and that is going crazy for as the story progresses with an ending taken from the top hat that leaves a very bitter taste and completely eliminates the desire to acquire the next episode of the title. Conclusion: this is not Final Fantasy VII.No se trata de un remake como nos prometieron si no de una reinvención del título\, solo por eso el juego tiene un aspecto negativo de gran importancia. Después de años esperándolo con ilusión tras la promesa del remake nos encontramos con... esto. Jugable y gráficamente es sobresaliente (salvo el popping en algunas texturas y la cámara durante los combates en espacios estrechos). Pero lo que le otorga el suspenso sin duda son los cambios argumentales que no solo influyen en este capitulo que nos atañe sino que también afectarán a los siguientes capítulos. A todos nos gusta la historia del juego original y absolutamente nadie ha pedido que cambien los acontecimientos\, no me considero un purista y abría tolerado ciertos cambios\, pero esto es demasiado\, en un rpg la historia es un pilar fundamental y añadirle viajes en el tiempo\, premoniciones y resurrecciones la convierte en una historia barata digna de una película de serie B\, en pocas palabras\, el juego rebosa fanservice por todos lados de manera descontrolada con todo lo que ello implica. Lo tenían muy fácil\, solo tenían que repetir lo que hicieron hace 23 años con tecnología actual\, eso era lo único que pedíamos y nos encontramos con una primera parte que solo es fiel al original durante las primeras horas de juego y que se va desmadrando a medida que se avanza en la historia con un final sacado de la chistera que deja un sabor muy amargo y elimina por completo las ganas de adquirir el siguiente episodio del título. Conclusión: esto no es Final Fantasy VII.… Expand"

Im also a big fan of FF7\, so take that in consideration while reading my review. Also being a fan helped me absorb the story and the materia system more easily.Everything in the game is very well made. Every little thing in the game is enjoyable. Played FF7 Remake about 15 hours a day until I finished it. It was a deep immersive experience where I left my friends asking \""where are you\"" on social media for days.Many times I had to stop and enjoy the breathtaking landscapes. Some cutscenes and moments are the very best I saw in gaming\, though I usually dislike the 'over the top' animations. There are few in the game but not much.The combat system\, the major difference from the original\, might divide fans. While I truly enjoyed the combat system on the original game\, the new one is addictive for me. I want to replay the game just for the challenge of facing the Arena and VR challenge on hard mode (something I didnt care about in the original).I love how they expended the story\, giving more attention to smaller characters like Jessie and Biggs. They did it to the point I became a fan of them. I didn't like the addiction of the Whispers very much\, though. I felt a bit out of place. I understand the need of them but I don't think it was very well implemented. Everytime they appeared I felt they were disrupting the story and the flow of the game.The materia system is my favorite on RPG games though it feels not as good and additive like in the original game. I don't know why. Maybe it feels a bit simpler and not as relevant as in the original game.The big let down for me is I find the game a bit short\, even for it being a part of a larger series. I usually spent 80 to 100 hours in triple A games on PS4 - playing it slow and saviouring the little details here and there. Usually when I finish the game I don't play it again. I beat it in about 40+ hours\, finishing every side quest and collecting every item I could. It somehow makes me want to revisit the original game\, which took me about 100 hours to beat. It was a life changing experience so I made the last the longer I could back in 1997\, though I felt satisfied when it ended and didnt ask for more. Its a good sign the you are sad the game ended\, right? It means you were enjoying the experience though not yet satisfied. The same didn't happen when I finished Death Stranding\, for instance. There\, I spent 100 hours and enjoyed almost everything\, but in the end I was getting tired of it. Now I keep asking myself when will I play the sequels.This is the best gaming experience I had in decades. By far.… Expand"

I struggled a bit with it at the beginning but once the get a hold of it\, it's much easier. One thing that really annoys me is how some bosses will go invulnerable just for the sake of the scripts. Unleash a big hit/choc the boss and you get a cutscene mid-fight. It happened way too many time\, you go into the \""Should I use this Limit Break or not\, will the boss be invulnerable at half HP or not\"".You also have very confusing boss mechanics. Which attack can be dodge\, which can be parried? The parry/counter command is clear enough\, but when it comes to dodge/parry\, it's completely different.The UI is cool\, nothing to say\, it's easy to navigate and to use.Story wise\, that's where the game lost 2 points for me.First\, there is too much Sephiroth appearance. I understand that he must appear\, otherwise in a 1:1 remake we would not see Sephiroth at all.The thing is\, he appears and act way too much\, more than family calls&message you receive on your birthday. Most of the time\, it's only to say \""Hi Cloud\"".Second\, the last chapters.I did not expect a 1:1 scenario and I enjoyed more than 30 hours of the game. But it honestly feels like the team took the original script\, the spin-off game scripts and wiped their asses with it to write their own fanfiction. In my opinion\, SE did not understood what FF7 fans loved. In the original\, there was nothing such as fate\, godlike being or simply old things/concepts that controls the humans. (Those are just examples\, not spoilers)The floating ghosts that appears a lot in the game are the main reason why the story will be change and there was no need of them. I really hope SQEX will not reuse them in the following parts.Without the second point\, the game would have been a 10/10.When FF7R adds depths to existing content\, it's great\, amazing.

The boss fights are also really entertaining. And last but not least\, the English voice actors did a great job. Sadly\, watching the cinematographic faces and flashy movements of the superbly designed characters\, certainly won’t be enough to please FF7 fans\, nor RPG fans in general. So now that I’ve covered the good stuff\, time for the bad news:First issue I noticed was the change in music. In the original the music was quite central\, even loud most of times\, but now it has been relegated to a “background” level\, sometimes it is even unnoticeable\, which strips the ambience from a lot of its former magic. Some moments were even left inexplicably silent.More about the ambience. The backgrounds were adapted to 3D with care (mostly)\, but they were also enlarged. Now this is a bad thing because they are only larger in size\, not in content\, so they ended up being a bit lifeless and uninteresting. Like… Nothing really happens anywhere. People\, buildings… are mostly decorative. There are some side quests here and there\, but mostly generic busy-work.But the previous are minor issues. The real problem with the title is the story (and the story-telling itself). They got a tiny part of the original game and\, following the same logic of quantity over quality they followed with the backgrounds\, enlarged the plot to colossal proportions filling it with uninteresting or downright tedious content. Every addition I encountered in the main plot\, damaged a little bit more the impeccable image of the original. A good example of how this played so wrong is characters new dialogue: in the original they remained quiet except for the critical moments\, giving you but a charismatic hint of their personalities and letting your imagination fill the gaps\, your mind building the best version of themselves as you always do when reading a book. In the remake however\, they have been given a huge amount of lines\, turning the book into a movie\, the problem is the dialogue is mostly uninteresting blabber that transformed these old great characters into generic anime clichés. The story telling is also messed up. Debussy once said “Music is the silence between the notes.“\, and this means a good story\, just like a good sonata\, needs some relaxed parts between the more important moments\, that serve the player to grasp some air before the new action comes. This was elegantly done in the original\, but in the remake the silence is tedious and boring\, and the notes are constantly played at such a high volume\, dramatized to such an absurd\, that one wonders if this can be considered real music or simply noise. To add some salt to injury\, all this is marketed with a misleading \""remake\"" label at 70€.Dramatic yet shallow\, with a clueless direction\, and a boring ride that you will finish purely out of nostalgia.… Expand"

The lv system  dosen't  really  feal like it matters much in the game compared to the original\, instead  it's more for powering up  your  weapons and lv your materia\, but the lv doesn't  do much  for  overall damage. On just normal difficulty  can have you frustrated as the best way to take down  enemies  is  to  stagger them and hit them hard while they are down however  it's not always easy to  accomplish  as lots of enemies  have resistances as well as specific requirements to get the stagger bar to move up and some you stagger get back up almost immediately making it difficult to get good damage in. If you don't have the right materia  in your weapons  when you get into a fight it will also be a frustratingly  uphill  battle as certain enemies can't be harmed much unless you use the elemental materia. Don't want to play the game on hard since even on normal  you can still lose to the same  boss fifteen  or more times. Battles could use a little  revamp for damage and hopefully  when the second  part comes out with the open world they will take it into consideration.

74150,FFVIIR,2020-04-20,6,"This was one of the main games I looked forward to for the past couple of years. I love how they expanded on the original characters along with added new ones.The combat system is not very fun and I wish they would have stayed with the original turn based system. The combat felt very repetitive. Triangle and parry was like 90% of the combat. They also have enemies that fly and in the original that was fine cause you could still attack them. In the remake the animation you have to do before u get to the enemy means they can move and your attack misses this happens a lot and is super annoying when you use you limit break because it will miss the enemy. Speaking of limit breaks when fighting a boss since they not have stages and cutscenes if you use your limit break right around the same time they do a cutscenes for a boss you will waste your limit break and not cause any damage to the boss this is super annoying when you are fighting harder bosses like Rufus who use cutscenes way to fricken much. Some of the pee on enemies feel very unbalanced and more difficult to kill then they should be this caused the fight to drag on where they felt like sponges.The story for the first 15 hours before you get to the Shinra building was amazing. They took and expanded on the original game and added new characters and some story changes that made everything coherent. However once you get to the Shinra building the reimagining of the story brought this game from a 8 to a 6 for me. The fact that you now have time travel\, multiple time lines and the ability to destroy \""Destiny\"" i.e kill the OG story killed it for me.They setup the game so when the next one comes out they don't have to follow the story and can do their own thing. You can see that by then bringing back Zack and completely undoing Advent Children and will probably undo Aeriths Death along with some other big beats the original game had it saddens me because I was expecting a remake not a reimagining.Another thing that pissed me off was Red he was not playable and I did not know that because I stayed away from all FF7 news. He was my main party member in the OG game and their reason for not letting you play him is the dumbest thing I have heard. They claim they would have to build attacks and things like that for him and it didn't make sense for them to do that because he's only in the later part of the game but he FIGHTS ALONG SIDE YOU! That means they built those attacks out anyways even his limit break so the real reason they don't want you to play as him is because in disk 2 they probably don't want you to play as him. Since this remake follows a different timeline they can do crap like that and get away with it. I spent $60 and got my money worth but will not be buying the next one instead I will watch it on YouTube especially since they are going to completely undo the original game.… Expand"

There was a bit of grind to level up to take on hard mode\, but I don't regret playing it a second time. I would highly recommend this game to people interested - it is a very fun game!Firstly the negatives. The graphics for NPCs can often look horrible. not every NPC needs to look amazing but at least make the ones you interact with for the story better looking. Also\, there are several instances where Square Enix have just inserted JPEG backgrounds for levels and it is really obvious. It just ruins the feel of the game as there are a lot of backgrounds that look stunning. The voice acting and lip syncing for NPCs is also really bad. This kind of stuff is unforgivable given that Square had 5+ years to perfect this.Now for the positives. Firstly\, the models for the main characters are stunning. Truly amazing and conform to the FF trend of characters looking amazing. The voice acting is also superb for the four main protagonists\, as well as side characters like Jessie. At least Square didn't miss the mark in this department.The game builds on characters really well and you really feel for the characters. I did cry once or twice and I have to tell you I don't cry much these days for films\, tv\, video games etc.The battle system is really fun and quick to learn. I highly recommend using the 'Assess' materia ability to learn the weaknesses of opponents and how to beat them. The bosses are really well designed and aren't that easy on Normal mode. I can safely say that some were quite challenging.The overall story is very good. yes some parts are stretched out but it allows for greater character development. There are also not a lot of side quests so it doesn't feel like endless grinding.I can't wait for the next parts of this wonderful game and re-imagining of FF7.… Expand"

There's good replay incentive and before I even finished my first playthrough\, I was already itching for unlocking hard mode.- There's so much value here. Beating the game the first time unlocks Chapter Selection\, which allows you to select difficulty prior to starting the chapter.

Normally a long game isn't bad it is more game for your buck nothing wrong with that. Final Fantasy however was having me do thing that felt so much like filler I could fit it in a JRPG pie. It didn't help I couldn't stand the characters or their dialog. The only thing keeping me going was the plot (when it progressed) and the combat. When you do fight it is fun and satisfying. I did enjoy every encounter I was in. I enjoyed the bug nuts boss fights even more. I do believe this could've been a wonderful game if they just trimmed it. Their sad attempt to get me to care about these characters with constant unnecessary dialog that bored the crap out of me only made me hate them more. If you love JRPG's this game is for you it is a very well made game. If you are like me and never really got into them for one reason or another Final Fantasy VII remake isn't going to change your mind anytime soon.… Expand"

It is a completely different game that happens to include tons of similar scenes that takes place in Midgar\, but it deviates decisively from the plot of the original. Do not use this game as a replacement for the original.That said\, FF7R looks absolutely gorgeous and comes with great character moments\, made better by the voice acting. The combat system is the best we've had in a mainline Final Fantasy game in quite a while (not counting XIV because it's an mmo). The materia system allows you to customize your moveset in a rather pleasant way and it's also a positive that even early game weapons can stay relevant for quite a while thanks to the upgrade system. There's also quite a few colorful NPCs that help hammer in that Midgar really is alive.However\, the game has its fair share of problems. Many of the plethora side quests feel overly simplistic or outright boring\, with barely anything interesting going on. The in-battle enemy info screen outright reveals the most effective strategy instead of trusting the player to figure it out on their own. Ladders and climbable scaffolds have been designed so poorly that the developers added a very intrusive blue arrow box pointing to each one of them. Moments that should feel urgent\, instead feel like someone had hit the breaks because you need to go through another 1-2 hours of nothing but hallways with the occasional enemy encounter. Many so-called obstacles in the areas are just gaps or objects that the player character should be able to bypass rather easily. Things like this\, bog the experience down.All in all\, Final Fantasy VII Remake comes off as sloppy despite its pretty exterior... Oh\, and also\, it is still not a remake.

The scorn for a fanbase represented in-game mockingly by \""fate whispers\"" says it all\, for they sawNomura has proven his genius with this attempt at retroactively ending Final Fantasy with VII; as it almost did 23-years ago. Making final the fantasy of millions was no small task when surely even the unholy union of Square and Enix had to do justice to Midgar's literally on-rails portion. The scorn for a fanbase represented in-game mockingly by \""fate whispers\"" says it all\, for they saw what us plebs could not: we needed more Kingdom Hearts 'plot'\, FFXV combat and FFXIII corridors. Lots of corridors.Ironically\, the sheer scope of Midgar shown in its iconic intro convinced my child self the whole game would play out within its confines\, when it was merely an unforgettable chunk of a MUCH larger world. That impression was distinct and stayed with me; as did my sense of awe upon reaching the world map. Times have changed: gone is turn-based combat\, gone are world maps and the Square of old are long dead. But I refused to believe a remake of arguably the greatest game of all time could fail\, and was open to change. Expand the world\, add to the characters and bring the universe to life in a way the hoof-handed\, spiky haired polygons of old never could. That was ALL they had to do. Fans wanted to see the vision of the original\, with current technology. No more\, no less.Only now can I fully appreciate the driven urgency of the original\, when compared against an entire chapter dedicated to turning off gigantic sodding lamps. Chapter 2's look at the aftermath of terrorist bombing gave a glimmer of world-building hope... before water filter busywork and Roach drained my optimism. 5-10hrs became a 30-40hr walkathon. The imminent dread of being crushed was disregarded for character switching; or\, instead of following a trail of blood\, forcing utterly pointless lever pulling. I was shoved down repeat corridors for hours upon hours\, with no regard for pacing or cohesion. On and on and on I trudged until the warmth of nostalgia was replaced by cold indifference and anger. WRPG sidequests\, like finding cats or kids\, further grinded progress to a halt.There was some wonderful fan-service introducing the characters\, such as finally seeing Aeris animated and hearing Barret voiced by a black man; preaching his views instead of just waggling his arms at Cloud. Chapter 9's Wall Market section was also so fabulous in its over the top silliness that it surpassed what the original tried to but couldn't do visually back then--Yakuza-esque absurdity. But that's about 2hrs out of 40! The few obvious highs were hit\, with all the nuance in-between lost amidst last words dialogue consisting of a desire to eat pizza. And Wedge.And then there is the combat... or\, more specifically\, the bosses. What should be epic showdowns become a case of '...is it over yet?'\, with sighs of relief exclaimed after spamming items/curaga+magnify. The amount of HP and bizarre reliance on getting a stagger meter up to do damage\, paired with bosses having phases like in Souls that abruptly reset stagger\, made this one of the worst combat experiences I have ever had. Battles of attrition involving learning to abuse skills like triple slash to auto-kill grunts\, and spamming overpowered magic. The best analogy I can make is a TV ad I saw involving a woman waiting\, bored\, for her lover to climax just to get it over with: impotent and inept. It is a hybrid battle chore\, forever confused between turn-based command slow-mo and real-time useless dodging\, with worse than useless AI. A mess resulting from not wanting to commit. And to top it off\, you cannot change materia in combat and go into bosses blind\, when they are even more unbearable if you don't bring *insert elemental here*. There's also no way to swap load-outs between characters\, and ch17 has you switching constantly. Awful design choices\, decades later. Truly\, the most fun I had playing was raging at the pull-up mini-game.The final insult was saved for last: non-committal\, nonsensical void world wtfisgoinonyyy that strongly suggests retconning\, without context. Why 7 seconds? What are you on about? WHY ARE WE IN SPACE!? 'Change destiny' tripe gets repeated as Cloud fights a giant KH shadow. Red XIII exists solely to spout exposition about fate whispers. Barret lets an old man (why was he even hanging on that ledge?) get a gun\, instead of killing him\, as the rest of the cast standstill as if in a bad anime. People do not die when killed. And why does destiny need changing when the world was saved\, again?... Aeris and Zack are treasured by the fanbase because their lives forced people to feel the weight of their virtual existences. The intent seems to be a happy ever after\, and I am convinced they have no clue what they are doing and are too arrogant to care as inflated egos led to a dementors sucking away at my will to play.This is no longer my Final Fantasy VII: it is an Advent Children sequel sold as a remake. All that is left is an empty husk that ruins memories with tedium.… Expand"

Some of the side quests are a bit bland and some of them in one of the later chapters were put awkwardly between the main quests.When it comes to soundtracks\, it is abhorrent. Some of the scenes were seriously excruciating especially in combination with the amazingly bad soundtrack.The English voice actors also did a great job of destroying the characters.The combat is trash and has a mix of hack n slash and hack n slash. The combat feels sluggish and punishes you for successfully pulling off certain actions.Graphics\, overall it looks disgusting even on PS4 slim considering the hardware and there are almost no frames at all. The characters look woeful with low quality and very undetailed models. Environments also look really bad as you can see low-quality textures in most areas. It could be results of either  budget cuts\,  budget cuts\, or budget cuts.As someone has played the original and knows the story\, I'm looking forward to seeing this game buried beneath stinking peat moss and forgotten… Expand"

Materia remains one of the most interesting ability systems I have ever had the joy of experiencing in a JRPG. The ATB gauge that dictates character actions perfectly incentivizes aggressive\, fast-paced play. Staggering enemies and exploiting individual weaknesses ensure that fighting never gets stale throughout the entire playthrough. Enemy types are extremely varied\, and their attacks are well-telegraphed to the point where everything feels balanced and fair.Story:While the story of FF7R is heavily altered from the original\, I couldn't point to any specific changes that make the story worse. In fact\, a lot of added story beats contribute more to the story. For example\, (SPOILER WARNING) Jessie's character is immensely expanded\, diving deeper into her past and her connection to her family (and by extension\, Avalanche). All these changes develop the characters and events further than ever before\, and I applaud Square Enix for taking this ambitious risk. In my personal opinion\, it definitely paid off.Graphics:Some textures will be low. Some areas will have bizarre lighting. However\, these minor gripes are completely trampled over whenever I look up and see the upper plates hovering ominously over the Midgar slums. These grips are trampled over whenever I see Cloud and his partners conversing with one another\, looking better than they ever have before. These gripes are completely trampled over whenever I activate a cinematic summon that turns the entire screen into a visual spectacle.While I could divulge further\, I don't want to accidentally spoil anything about this near-perfect experience. This is the Final Fantasy 7 that Final Fantasy 7 should be. I applaud Square Enix and its team for realizing Midgar in this fresh\, new\, exciting way. I look forward to the future of the FF7R series. If you are at all interested in this game\, even if you have not played the original game\, I implore you to give this game a try.

Linear path ways connect places brimming with LIFE. Every time you visit a new town you will end up being overwhelmed by the energy.Gameplay 8/10+ The combat feels hectic at first\, but once you get the hand of it it is pretty fluid.+ Lots of streamlined quality of life services\, you can feel the devs really wanted to avoid unnecessary chores- What troubled me a little is the lack of Materia sets. Party members go in and out a whole lot at times and you are forced to resetting the materia for the upcoming fights on your own.- Even for people who never played FF7 some episodes were obviously filler. The dumbest example was when the party was forced a detour because some dude stole the key to a generic metallic door\, some episodes ago we hacked down a giant robot 10 times bigger and now the one thing that stops us is a locked door?

We all expected a 1:1 Remake and I completely understand anyone's frustration or anger with the way this game subverted expectations. I am a fan of FF7 who played the original when it came out\, and so I think everyone's feelings are valid and understandable. I was initially angry at the ending too.That being said\, I ask that you keep an open mind and think critically about the ending and all of the times the \""whispers\"" showed up throughout the game. We don't have any idea what will happen\, but the theories and prospects are very exciting. I don't want to spoil anything\, but I will say that I don't think you should take the ending at face value. Both Aerith and Sephiroth seem to know more than they let on. Don't write this game off just yet. Let's wait until the next installment and see where the story goes.Apart from the story\, I think the game was absolutely fantastic. The battle system was a nice blend of old and new. I really believe this may be the best implementation of a turn-based/action hybrid I've ever seen. The materia system works very similarly to how it worked in the original\, and it was a blast leveling up the weapons and abilities.The graphics are absolutely breathtaking. I still can't believe they pulled this off on a PS4. The characters are all modeled immaculately\, and the skybox is pre-rendered and so\, so beautiful.The voice acting is spot on\, the characters all act how I imagined they would act\, and there isn't so much awkwardness like in Final Fantasy XV. You can tell Square went the extra mile to make this game appeal to Western fans. I don't know that there has been a better English voice cast for a Japanese game.As for negatives\, the majority of my negatives are nitpicks.The game feels extremely padded in parts. They took what was essentially a 4-8 hour experience from the original and made it a 30-40 hour journey. While some of the new content is awesome\, some of it misses the mark and feels like it's trying to waste your time.Also\, the game is fairly linear. I don't know that it ever reaches Final Fantasy XIII \""Hallway Simulator\"" levels\, but it straddles the line pretty hard. With that being said\, Midgar was always really linear in the original\, so in that respect\, this game is more \""open\"" than the original.Finally\, I want to talk about the extreme level of pop-in and the bafflingly low quality textures in the game. In chapter 3\, which is one of the more \""open\"" chapters of the game\, characters can be seen popping in left and right if you run. The low quality textures are really strange\, especially compared to how detailed and nearly perfect the character models are. One good example is the door to Tifa's room in chapter 3. It's so low quality that I can't believe they didn't notice. I really think it's a PS4 memory issue and this will be fixed next year when the game releases on PC and the next gen consoles. Until then\, we will have to live with the low quality doors. It's not that bad\, and it doesn't really affect the whole game\, but when you see it\, it stands out like a sore thumb.All in all\, I had a blast with the game and I think it is well worth your time whether you are a new fan or old. The future is scary and exhilarating\, but have faith and patience and go discuss your theories with other fans! Try to keep an open mind and respect the opinions of others.… Expand"

Camera settings: Set both to the maximum distance away\, I think it's number 3. The American voice acting is horrible\, and the camera further from your characters lets you see more of the world\, and enemies better in battles.I'm about 20 hours in\, taking my time trying to explore every part of the world\, and playing on the standard PS4. Just arrived at the church. This game was always going to struggle to live up to it's own hype and legacy\, especially with the long development time and limitations of the current generations of consoles\, when we are so close to the next ones being released.Having said that\, it looks beautiful (with some texture issues that can be forgiven and will hopefully be addressed with a patch)\, the music is amazing\, and the game has heart and humour in spades. The side missions can be a little simplistic\, some areas are a bit repetitive (although nowhere near as bad as a game like Persona 5)\, some environments and characters look better than others (a lot of attention seems to have been paid to the main characters\, with the NPCs looking quite basic)\, and the camera in battle can be a pain\, but all of these things pale in comparison to just walking around and experiencing this world and this story. For me personally\, Horizon Zero Dawn set the benchmark for visuals on the PS4 for these types of games (you could compare the combat systems too if you wanted - action with tactical elements)\, and I'm not sure this reaches that level\, especially with the NPCs.The more action-focussed direction they have taken it in seems like a natural evolution\, and has been handled respectfully while still allowing for a tactical side to combat and planning\, especially with managing your Materia and upgrading the weapons. I still prefer the system of Final Fantasy XII\, where you could really select what each team member would be doing in more detail\, and with this game I am never exactly sure what the person I am not controlling is doing\, so I end up constantly switching between characters. You also can't choose\, without switching to them and moving them\, if they are standing further away or closer to enemies (for example if you want someone to cast spells and heal from a distance)\, which is a bit of an issue. In the original FFVII you could select which characters were at the front and back\, at least.No doubt in the next instalment of Remake on PS5 the small technical issues we see here will have been addressed fully. I hope and imagine that this one will even work on PS5\, and maybe if we are lucky the save files will be transferable too. With this sort of game\, come at it with an open mind\, and I think you will be rewarded. It is far from perfect\, but it still stands head and shoulders above most other games out there right now.… Expand"
74284,FFVIIR,2020-04-30,0,"This is NOT FF7. It's a game LOADED with pointless fetch quests to stretch out the game to justify releasing in multiple parts.  The story has been completely changed (to the point that it is a completely different game).  The battle system is the only thing that's fun\, but you only control one character and the AI on the computer controlled characters in your party is completely broken. You can't give them commands until their ATB is full\, but they just stand there and don't do anything to build their ATB.  So it's basically a one person party the entire game because the other two members are nearly useless.The people giving this game a positive score just bought into the hype.  It's loaded with fetch quests\, has a completely different plot and story (I can't understate this)\, the computer AI on your party members is broken\, and the only thing that's done well are the story parts kept in from the original (which constitutes less than 5% of the the playtime of the remake. the rest is new and added in and/or pointless fetch quests).The time travel twist completely makes this a different story.  I am cool with added backstories and tweaking the existing story here and there.  And the parts they did that were well done.  But then they took a sledgehammer to the story with the ending.  This is not what ANYONE wanted when fans were begging for a remake for a decade.The original FF7 is my favorite game of all time.  I was disappointed when I heard the changes that were made to the game during development\, and that they were dividing it into multiple games.

Whether it's the full original story or not really has nothing to do with the fact that it's a full-size game and is perfectly acceptable at full price.  It's about 3 times as long as 75% of AAA games that come out these days at the same price.  Would you rather they just threw together the entire game as fast as possible?  It took like 5 years just to develop what they currently have because of how huge the game is.The original had PRERENDERED BACKGROUNDS\, and extremely low poly models people!  3D modeling\, texturing\, and animating all that stuff takes twice the amount of people 10 times as long as it would for a single person to put together a little static background for you to run around in.  You can NOT compare the number of locations compared to the original.  Recreating Midgar in high fidelity\, fully 3D likely took longer than the entire original game took to develop. the way they were made is so wildly different\, but people hear in a review that it's only the first part fo the game and they immediately scream that it's somehow a rip off because they are completely clueless.Personally\, the idea of an entirely separate series of FF7 Remake chapters that are each as long as a full game is better than I ever could have imagined.  They are taking such care with each and every second of this classic game to try and do it justice.  This is literally the opposite of a quick cash grab\, but uninformed morons think because it doesn't cover the same amount of story that automatically means that it is.  I am just sickened by some people's reactions to this game\, and the majority of them refunded it before even finding out that it is a full-on\, full-length experience.Look at the product first\, just because something is episodic doesn't mean it's bad or a rip-off\, this game is literally the exact opposite\, it would have taken another 5 - 7 years of development to release the entire game\, this way we can get a full remake of the original redone in the best way possible.  Why people are so against episodic releases is totally baffling.  If it makes the end product better\, why are you just automatically opposed to it?  It's people like these that stop massive games like FF7 from ever getting remade\, developers are afraid to tackle the projects because they are way too big to do in one single go\, and they are afraid of people's automatic reactions to an episodic format.… Expand"

The ability to upgrade the equipment is nice. Not the deepest feature of the game\, but a positive one nonetheless.The game's biggest flaw is its inability to properly tell a story. The pace is inexistant. Most of the time you will wander through endless corridors that offer little creativity from a game-design perspective. If the original game included these corridors\, they were rather short and diversified. Here\, they're long\, and very repetitive.As we know\, this Remake only focuses on Midgar. Why not? If we can discover new parts of the city\, learn more about the characters and experience new storylines\, I'm all for it. The issue is almost nothing is new. This is a 5 hours story spread on a 30 hours game. We don't learn anything new about Midgar\, we're not allowed to explore the city at all. Worst\, the rare new elements the game brings are embarrassing at best. I did appreciate the bits we learn about Biggs\, Wedge and Jesse\, but characters like Chadley or Roche have no relevancy in FF7. They just show Nomura's issues in creating interesting characters. So here we are\, walking through endless corridors\, waiting for an underwhelming story to reveal itself.From a visual point of view\, FF7 remake is weird. Some environments are absolutely stunning. The core game looks great. But some textures look like they belong to a PS2 game (I said PS2\, not PS3). And the NPC look horrendous.  It's a bit of a shame but it's not the end of the world. The biggest issue here I would say is that Midgar slums are a bit boring\, and repetitive. I would have hoped a bit more variety in the environments.Is this game a bad game? Not really. The fights are great fun\, and each key moment is magnified. Is it a worthy remake? Not at all. The original Final Fantasy VII was a perfect mix of a great combat system\, an interesting story and great graphics. This Remake is not  the visual masterpiece I was expecting\, but it's still a pleasant game to look at.

74400,FFVIIR,2020-10-13,8,"I'm skeptical of the 10/10 reviews. I've had this game for a week now and completed it in around 40 hours because I took my sweet time.Good:- The combat is a challenging\, fun\, action/turn based hybrid that requires you to actually pay attention and know what you're doing.- The visuals are (usually) amazing. There are some great scenic points in the game. The backdrops of Midgar seem prerendered rather than actually in game\, which I think is actually a very smart move because it's reminiscent of the original and has a lot of charm.- The voice acting is for the most part very enjoyable.- The expanded backstories of some minor characters is so good to see. It was a pleasure to have more interaction with the Avalanche crew. They felt like real people and were done justice (in the way that they act and are presented).- I feel the main characters were also done rather well. I love Barrett probably more than i originally did\, and Cloud's characterisation is on point.- The key locations are pulled of very well\, especially Wall Market in chapter 9. I also really enjoyed the Shinra building section. I might've liked there to be more to interact with in certain areas\, though.- The boss fights are really cool and are long\, but don't feel like a chore to do.- There are quite a lot of sweet nostalgic moments.- I love the collectible music disks but I wish I could listen to them on the go.- Marlene is so bloody adorable.Mixed:- The music is hit and miss. The tracks which are quite faithful to the original are amazing. some of the more tampered with versions are a little much\, and some are almost unrecognizable. One track in particular I found terrible and obnoxious (but that's just my music taste). Overall\, I'd have preferred a little more faith to the original soundtrack and less variations of the same tracks strewn throughout\, as it seems to lack cohesion.- Some of the textures are pixelated and a bit ugly\, which you wouldn't expect of a game with this budget (and pricetag). I say this is mixed because because I actually don't notice them a lot\, but when I do it's very jarring.- Rufus' character design isn't so great.- The animation for moving under/between obstacles is painfully slow. And some sections force you to walk slow which kind of gets on my nerves.- I'd have liked a little more freedom to explore certain parts when I felt like it\, rather than have the game handhold me and tell me I can't go this or that way just yet with that obnoxious pop up.Bad:- Sephiroth's voice actor is hit and miss.- Sephiroth and meteor are featured a little too much too early on.- Some of the side quests were like FFXII hunts\, which I enjoyed. But in general they're lacklustre\, generic go here\, kill a reskinned enemy\, come back. No soul or effort seems to have been put into a lot of them. I'd expect more from a game with such a large budget and price tag.Very bad:- The whispers kind of ruin a lot of moments in the game and mess up the flow. It's more to do with their implementation in the story than the actual concept of the whispers themselves. I didn't like them.Additional thoughts:I'm a little confused about how they're going to manage the continuity of character progression from this game to the next. I finished at level 39 with many maxed out spell materias and around 5 summons. Imagine leaving Midgar in FFVII at level 39\, around 4000hp\, with fire 3\, bolt 3\, cure 3\, life materia\, etc. Granted there are quite a few materia from the original that isn't in this game yet\, but I've got a lot. I've got a ton of weapons you don't get until well after you leave Midgar.… Expand"
74401,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,4,"Square advertised this game series as the remake that fans had hoped and wished for\, and for the most part the first game absolutely delivered on that. Midgar is faithfully reproduced and feels more alive than it’s ever been. The graphics are beautiful and perfectly match the character of the city and the slums. The characters are multi-dimensional\, even the background Avalanche trio of Biggs\, Wedge and Jessie get more to do and say. The combat is fun and challenging once you get used to the fundamentals and how each character handles. Aside from a few slow bits\, too linear places and the admittedly boring sidequests\, I had a blast with the first 17 chapters and it was getting me stoked for the future games. I wanted to see Nibelheim\, Rocket Town\, Wutai\, Cosmo Canyon and the rest of the characters experience the same loving treatment given to Midgar in this game. I started to think to myself ‘this is too good to be true’\, it was damn-near perfect.Well\, turns out it was too good to be true. Having finished the game\, I now find myself absolutely shellshocked that Square could take such an easy slam-dunk and fumble it at the literal final hurdle. Chapter 18 – the ending chapter - single-handedly brings the entire game down crashing and burning. It’s a baffling\, disappointing trainwreck that rips apart the spirit of not only the ORIGINAL game but the first 17 chapters of ITS OWN GAME on top of that. I had several theories about what the floating things that kept popping up during the game were\, but I honestly believed all that they were was something to do with the Reunion that is prominent in the story of FFVII. Nope\, surprise! They’re mystical time ghosts who preserve ‘destiny’\, because we clearly needed that crap from Kingdom Hearts in here – complete with a huge black blob boss. And double surprise! Sephiroth can now travel in space and parallel dimensions like **** Dr Strange. And Zack is somehow also still alive. Meaning that the emotional weight of his death is completely invalidated. I’M NOT EVEN LYING about any of this.The whole chapter and ending made me bash my head against the wall\, and I still lost less braincells than watching it all unfold. I’m struggling to understand what the **** happened. And if your plot is unintelligible to a lot of your audience then I’m sorry\, but it’s not a good plot. What was so wrong with the original story that warranted this absurd deviation? Did Nomura and Nojima decide that it wasn’t “”cool”” or “”meta”” enough for the Gen-Zers who’ve never played the 1997 original? We’ll probably never know. But nevertheless\, it took my enjoyment of the game and excitement of the future and threw it in the trash. All my hype destroyed in one short hour. I can’t for the life of me understand how the hell they thought that this was the direction those like me who loved Final Fantasy VII wanted to go in. I can’t understand that the same people who gave us the original story that was almost perfect could turn it into such moronic drivel.The game was easily a 9/10 before Chapter 18\, but that ridiculous ending seriously deserves a 0/10. So I averaged the score to 4/10. It’s frankly saddening. Square shouldn’t have advertised this as a ‘remake’. It’s clearly not. It’s clearly aiming to be a reboot. A reboot that\, from the ending of the first part\, will end up trumping Advent Children in the stakes of gaudy nonsense. It’s ‘Rebuild of Evangelion’ levels of reboot. I feel cheated\, and I was one of the people who DIDN’T want just the original game with HD graphics\, and expected there to be some story changes. But I expected those changes to actually ADD to the original story\, not take away practically everything it had in favour of lazy\, brainless tropes. I’m not gonna stick around for the next games in the series now. I don’t want the rest of Final Fantasy VII Remake if it’s based on the rubbish in Chapter 18. Sorry\, Square\, but you blew it. I’ll just play the original from now on.… Expand"

Of course it could be still better optimized. Also loading times are okay-ish. Considerung I already have a SSD inside they are sometimes a little bit too much\, which is frustrating especially in some mini-games you need to do for completionist. Still the game in total runs very smooth and I am really waiting to play this again on the PS5.Graphics and sound 9.5/10:I personally can only say that I loved both to an extend that it really immersed me into the game. The graphics are really good except that sometimes there seems to be an issue with very low-detailed texture tiles. I m not sure whether this is intended to save memory or not but SquareEnix should really try to enhance this a bit. Mostly those things occur outside of the normal game view so it is not bothering me too much but it reduces the overall really good quality of the game. Also I want to emphasize the very good HDR implementation.Sound is awesome as usual\, there is not much to say. Rockets explode\, swords cling in the air and spells occur nearby. For me the biggest let down here is\, that they remixed many of the vanilla soundtracks which is truely cannot understand. Of course many and most of the iconic tunes are back again but then some remixes are (IMHO) bad or at least worse then the orginal ones. It d be cool to have an option for this. In addition I cannot understand why they touch things like these when they know that people consider these things as the most valuable.Now the probably hardest part: Story and game length 7/10:I finished this game with a guide nearby on normal in around 43hrs. Having this said I didnt rush too much and I was on completionist route (doing ground work for the 100% trophy). That said the game length seems okay BUT... (here it is) a lot seems really unnecessarily drawn out. There are many passages where you can only slow-walk (which I truely hate) and many passages where you have to climb under\, over\, around or squeeze. I dont mind these mechanics but they should not be over-used.In addition the concept of chapter slices is personally one of the biggest let downs. It does not feel very consistent. Also the slices vary from 1hr to 4hr parts which might be annoying for casual players. The side quests could ve done a lot but SquareEnix missed the opportunity to include enough of those and make them enjoyable. Most of these are very basics or next to pointless which is very sad.The Remake changes:So they changed stuff. Wont spoil it here. I m personally okay with those changes. It gives some new impressions and most of these are really OKAY. People are very upset of minor changes which feels unnecessary. You can enjoy the game\, you learn a lot on the characters and discover more bit in detail which is amazing. The ending is very controversial and I m very torn about it. Whether this is good or bad will be decided by whats coming next.And this is the biggest issue with FF7R!Of course I knew it was released episodic but oh boy... this part is maybe 20% of the initial plotline. It misses the open world in general and it gives plot indication to the players that wont make any sense without the rest. This might be okay for classic players but is an absolute no-go for the new crowd. Also I hope they will be reasonable on the prices and release periods for the other parts because otherwise this could be considered a huge rip-off.I wont loose faith and I really enjoyed this part so far. If you are not sure\, wait for a price drop. It is still a very good game with awesome characters and good action that is presented decently on current gen PS4.… Expand"

Its still one of my favorite games. The remake judged on its own is an ok game with great graphics and character models\, but it has almost nothing of the things which made the original FF7 such a great game:- it's not an open world game any more with a huge world to explore freely\, but rather walking through a lot of linear corridors and hallways and needlessly blown up filler content with no meaning other than stretching out Midgar into a full length game.- you can't even move around freely in Midgar. When i heard first of this remake playing only in Midgar\, I thought they make some GTA type of open world city exploration out of it and that Cloud could drive around in the city with his motorcycle\, but its really not like that at all. Its very very linear and episodic.- It has a lot of MMO like meaningless fetch quests\, like rescuing cats or bringing something from point A to point B. And with a lot I mean really a lot.The graphic\, animations\, overall presentation and sound is very good in this game and the combat system is kind of fun\, even if its way to easy\, but everything else feels just mediocre at best and not nearly as good as in the original. What I really miss most is the huge world you could travel around in and all the different environments you could visit in the original.Even if FF 7 remake plays only in Midgar i really don't understand why they didn't make it more open world exploration like\, like I imagine Cyperpunk 2077 or Dying Light 2 to be.… Expand"

Visuals I can only say breath taking it's so great to see the characters and world that I love so much looking as beautiful as it does 9/10 and I have heard of others talking about texture issues but I only saw it maybe once or twice so it didn't affect me. Now for the part that ruined it for me the Story\, well what can I say they did such an amazing job for like 95% of the game step for step it was amazing but as soon as I hit the end of the highway and the game became Kingdom Hearts and I was fighting the Darkness it all fell apart\, with them making this a new story it's not what I nor a lot of fans were looking for\, the Final Fantasy 7 story was already confusing and full and they could have fleshed that out and made it perfect like they were doing for most of the game but for them to add alternate time-lines and whatever else they plan it just ruins it for me so I hate to do this but the story gets a 3/10.

Things have been changed around to suit the episodic narrative and there's been a heavy expansion of various things (that frankly didn't need it).3. The parts that ARE from the original\, are true to it.  Segments and fights and bosses and even scripted lines are almost perfectly taken from the original\, which is good.4.  Jessie and Hojo are the standout stars of the game in terms of memorable characters\, with Biggs and Tifa a close second and Red XIII a close third.Here's the thing.  I'm not going to fault the game for trying something new.  My issue isn't that.  It's the way it was done.The game feels patchwork.  The first few hours are almost cut-and-paste from the original\, then it veers sharply left into a completely different thing\, then veers back.  Segments that were previously flashbacks for Cloud are present\, but in some cases you're playing them out rather than them being just flashbacks.  The final 2-3 hours in particular make absolutely no sense.Then it hits you.They wrote this game to try and bridge Crisis Core to the main game.If you don't remember Crisis Core\, don't feel bad.  It was a PSP game\, a LONG time ago\, and not a very good one.It wasn't that I hated this.  I didn't.  I actually had fun on a few bosses and the voice acting is superb.  But this felt like they started down the path of a true remake and then at some point someone got involved who wanted more explosions and random changes that made no sense as implemented.Finally\, Midgar is full of fluff and padding.  A bunch of quests and walking eat up the bulk of the gameplay\, and you'd be hard pressed to get 20 hours out of it if you only focused on the main segments.I'll close by stressing once again: Jessie is easily the best character.  Period.  You will remember her long after you've played.  She was written that well and her voice actor did so good.  Meanwhile\, Aerith came off annoying and childish the majority of the game - likely to make you feel the annoyance that Cloud felt when escorting her\, but over the top.Is it worth playing?

I think its a miracle this game came out as good as it did\, i dont think people realize what the true length of this episodic game is going to be\, and throughout it all\, we get to play the same characters. me and my brother get to be excited for a new 40 hours release of our favorite game\, every couple years (probably but thats ok). they did a wonderful job\, i saw one of the negative reviews mentioning the dating options but i love tha aspect so much!  you get to learn so much more about everyone. i have to give it 10\, i never had a dull moment\, only real bad thing was there is one particularly bad loading time during a section and some npc characters look a bit dated. didnt effect my experience whatsoever so 10/10\, loved it\, big fan\, cant wait for episode 2\, hell\, cant wait to just play through this again.… Expand"

Waiting to push buttons and side quests that are obviously an afterthought for filler. There is nothing remake about this. It's a reimagining of the story that completely breaks the story and the franchises existing cannon past and present. The killing destiny loophole at the end doesn't really save anything.There isn't anything really rewarding in the game as it's all basically handed to you. Vending machines always have deals on items for battles and money is excessively plentiful. The game is painfully linear\, even worse than midgar was in the original game. The combat is painfully simple and unengaging coupled with micromanaging that is more tedious than helpful to the situation.The voice acting is terrible most characters sound mentally damaged and awkward.

It just don't look\, sound or feel like FF7 in anyway.I'm sure real fans of the original get what I'm saying. All the sense of mistery\, of haunting\, melancholy and beauty of life expressed by the original have been replaced with... well... flashy visuals. That's pretty much it. They basically sold the very soul of the game to buy an empty good looking body.The trick here is: all the good you may be experiencing playing this remake belongs to the nostalgia; thus belongs to the original.Visually they actually made a good job to reproduce every place as we remember it. But\, when the nostalgia effect ends\, nothing remains and you will begin to see the game for what it is: a PROLOGUE to the original story\, diluted with some generic and meaningless content which simply does not belong to FF7.But\, let's split it up a bit. The following are huge mistakes which alone would be enough to ruin the game at once; and we have all of them:1. THE EPISODIC CHOICEYou don't split an RPG in episodes. Ever. You completely destroy the sense of continuity\, you reset the tension built until the moment you interrupt an episode\, you break the story\, you fail to deliver a sense of greatness and massive world; and most of all you lose one of the core concepts of an rpg\, that is character building.What's the point of even level\, equip and customize characters if they go to oblivion at the end of the episode? The character state at the beginning of the next episode will be just reset to some standard point\, thus they will not be MY characters. Can you tell how possibly bad is that in this archetype?2. SUBQUESTS AND PADDING CONTENTWhat do you get if you merge a lot of water with good wine? Better wine? I think not. More likely more wine\, but with a horrible taste.That's basically what they did here. They interrupted the storytelling several times to make the player do some generic meaningless quest.Well\, side quests don't belong here\, they belong to open world games. For a reason.And reason is\, you have a world to explore and what you want to do in this world is up to you.You just can ignore them\, or some of them\, and still have a massive world to explore.This is not the case. There's no reason to pause a thrilling story from being told\, well... unless you don't have much of a story to tell\, having cut it. (see point 1)3. MAJOR STORY CHANGESThis one is pretty obvious. You don't want to change the story everyone remembers to something different. On top of that you put in it elements from the original showed as \""future visions\"". Why would you that? Fans will get upset because they were asking to re-experience the story like they remembered; new players just won't understand it in the first place\, not knowing the original story.Furthermore\, you don't do this in a game you call remake. This is just not what people expect\, at a point that feels scam-like\, misleading and insulting.Again\, this is not FF7. You cannot simply put a logo\, characters and skins onto a generic empty game and hope it will become what you are trying to shape. Things just don't work this way\, it's not something that a decent company in gaming industry would EVER do.Things are\, this game is out since 2 weeks\, so people is understandably still excited about it\, but it will be easily forgotten in few months.The reason we are all talking so much about this remake is the glorious game the original still represents after 23 years.And 23 years VS few months gives a very accurate idea of the difference between the two.… Expand"

You have needed set of materia for one party\, but in the last chapters\, when you often switch characters you always have to switch materies. No one has told you\, that you need the whole set of materia for all characters.Too many materia in the end\, very long list to select from.Asses materia\, you always need to switch it.You frequently need to switch materia\, when you have a small number of slots.- There is no text search in enemy intel.

The motivation for this is to check the validity of the claims from the brigade of angry gamers who want to accuse any game developer not named CDPR of engaging in money grabs.I cleared the city of Midgar in the original FF7 in under 5 hours while engaging literally every NPC\, collecting every item\, and never once running from a battle--that's with several instances of backtracking. If I had perfect recall on everything (train graveyard navigation\, Shinra building puzzles\, where to buy key items) I could have done it in just over 4. I'm far from a speed runner. I know when I played this as a kid it took me days to get out of Midgar because I was even more clueless and spent hours aimlessly wandering around until I found the NPC that had the wig\, the batteries\, or the dress. I didn't have reference magazines and didn't even care. I was a kid exploring this new amazing 3D world. That's not the case for most of us now. We're adults\, we read text dialogue\, we can follow a story\, and we can go from point A to point B without getting distracted.The FF7 Remake Pt. 1 is more linear\, has quest markers\, and (eventually) fast travel. All of those QoL additions and it's still (being generous) a 35-hour minimum to get through the story on your first go\, unless you're playing on Easy and just hack-and-slashing your way through everything. I'll wager it will take the average gamer 40-45 hours to finish the story and 50+ for platinum hunters/completionists\, and double that to complete Hard Mode (bosses have completely different mechanics for HM so it's legitimately different and a step above NG+). Any AAA game with this length and this level of quality put into the soundtrack\, graphics\, and considerably more detailed story is absolutely worth $60.People claiming this is 1/3 of a game that originally retailed at $50 23 years ago are participating in one of the most absurd examples of a false equivalency in recent memory. This is not a remaster\, it is a remake. It's a completely new game built from the ground up. It doesn't matter if the characters already existed\, if the basic structure of the narrative was already written\, or whatever. It's. a. new. game. There are a dozen character arcs and additional sequences that were never in the original game.Many of our memories of the original game are heavily muddled by hours and hours of grinding and just wasting time having fun with that. The problem is that's not an actual component of the game's length\, it was entirely optional\, and it certainly was not a priority in the first disc of the game that dealt with Midgar. The vast majority of people didn't bother grinding until we reached the world map.I understand some players' frustrations that they don't get to play a remade version of the entire game in one go\, but if you look at the level of quality they put into the first installment it seems pretty clear why they are taking this route. Calling this a money grab is being toxic just for the sake of being toxic. This is not a buggy\, half-asked mess of a title released to capitalize on some trend and I never saw a single shred of evidence that they cut corners on any aspect of the game's design. This remake has been carefully planned for years and Square should be proud of themselves.This first chapter with Midgar absolutely exceeds the original in depth and quality and\, this will be a hard-to-swallow pill\, but you're the absolutely worse type of fanboy if you think otherwise.… Expand"

There's not much need to be said here. There are some places where you can tell the texture wasn't well done and the lighting can be dark in caves if you don't adjust your lighting. However\, I figured the lighting was put together that way to make it feel realistic. Overall though\, you're going to be amazed at how good this game looks.Story: I would have given this game a full point\, but the beginning was a little slow during chapter 3 and some parts in the story was just not realistic. All I'm going to say is that chapter 4 is an example of what it means to be immortal when you clearly should have died -- it wasn't believable. Other than that\, this game puts you on a hell of a ride.Gameplay: Game feels fluid\, the battles were fun\, all the characters were unique to their playstyle\, the game felt really good when moving around\, and the buttons were really simple to learn/remember. What I didn't like was when the camera was fixed in position during some parts of the game\, and sometimes getting on a ladder was annoying because I had to face directly at it but my character would move too fast and walk past the ladder. However\, this game was still really fun.Characters: These characters are really cool. Shoot\, even the side characters are cool. The only flaw was the fact that no one in the story really has a dramatic change.  All the main characters have their developments and the same with some side characters. Nothing too amazing\, but let me just say that the characters are very likable towards the end. How can you not like these characters? Especially Barret. The guy sings the original FF7 victory anthem after fights!Music: Come on\, do I really need to say much here? The original game's music is iconic.Customization: I'll start with what the game lacks. It doesn't have skins\, dyes\, a skill tree\, or smithing. The game does come with a regular weapon\, armor\, and accessory equipment. It still has the original FF7 materia customization\, weapons have their own stat tree\, characters can learn skills from weapons\, and you can have different types of builds for each character (I made Cloud a magic user).Playtime: I did almost all the side quests and beat the game at around 35 hours. Honestly\, I wish the game was longer\, but 35 hours is solid and about right for a lot of people. I just feel that if the Witcher 3 could give me 80+ hours worth on my first playthrough\, FF7 could have at least given me 50 hours.Content: There are quite a bit of mini-games\, there are a few side missions\, and a good amount of character dialogue/interactions.UI/GS: The game's UI is really simple and clean. It just does what it needs to do. The color scheme works. The speed between loads is pretty quick. The slowest process would have to be saving. The game gives up creativity for speed.Emotional Impact: This game will give you multiple feelings. A side character made me feel sad -- a side character! Barret's the star of the show and Cloud's Mr. Cool. It's a hell of a ride. They really save the best for the last part of the game.This is a must-play for RPG players. I understand some people have low attention spans and can't wait for the story to develop\, but I'm telling you\, it'll be worth it at the end. This game is all about the story. It was pretty epic.… Expand"

74529,FFVIIR,2020-04-20,4,"The worst part about quarantine is being stuck in the same building as Kingdom Hearts 4--err\, FF7 Remake.First half of the game was great.  Second half was padded to hell and back with so much filler that it was a struggle to get through.  The fun pretty much ended after Wall Market.Though I wasn't enjoying myself anymore I kept going\, unaware of just how bad it was going to get.  Near the ending the (original) story is hijacked and becomes Kingdom Hearts--and as a writer (and someone with enough intellectual capability to boil an egg) nothing could be more disappointing.I saw the signs early on but I never thought they would culminate into quite possibly the worst plot decision possible.Random ghosts interrupting Aerith's introduction scene\, forcing her to emit Vanille's orgasm sounds\, and then chasing her down an alleyway?  Weird\, awkward\, but entirely in-line with modern Japanese storytelling.Cloud having a seizure and Sephiroth appearing every 5 minutes\, dispelling any potential mystery or build-up?  Ham-fisted\, but the narrators masturbating about how great their villain is was not unexpected.What I did not expect was for Aerith to suddenly and inexplicably become a possessed\, all-knowing arbiter of time.  I didn't expect the party to so easily walk through a fate-portal without asking what was going on.  I didn't expect to kill the God of Fate.  I never for a second thought that Sephiroth would kill Barret and then Barret would be revived Kairi-style.  I didn't think that Fate had been controlling everything up until now\, rendering everything I did in the last 40 hours meaningless.I can't believe they messed up this badly.  If there was a BINGO card featuring all the ways *not* to write a story\, FF7R will have filled out every square.  It's impressive in an apocalyptic coronavirus kind of way.I'm sure there's an alternate version of me in a different timeline multiverse that *can* believe they messed up this badly.  You just have to kill some fate gods to release me from those chains.  But it's too late\, because I'm already dead because Sephiroth killed me.  Oops\, now I'm alive again.  Thanks\, Fate!

To me\, if a piece of art doesn't piss off at least someone\, it's not trying to push forward.  I love that Square Enix didn't play it safe like they did with Dragon Quest XI\, I want new things and I love how they did that here.  As a remake I also appreciate this.  With Resident Evil 2 and Link's Awakening\, I found myself a little bored after a while as the games were almost exact replica's of the original just with a fresh modern coat of pain\, more specifically with Link's Awakening.   This is such a better adaptation to modern standards that I can't wait to see what comes next.  Of course\, it's not perfect\, that's why I can't give it a 10\, some textures are low res and it can feel a little padded and linear in some parts.

The problem with this is that enemies have super armorThe biggest problem of the game is its inability to decide whether it's an action game or an RPG.  The combination ends up feeling like someone lazily cobbled the two together without a concern about how it worked. The main feature is circled around using enemy weaknesses to pressure them\, then stagger\, and finally damage/kill them. The problem with this is that enemies have super armor and do not flinch until you can pressure or stagger them. Bosses will change patterns several times over a fight and make it harder to do this each time with the occasional instant kill in their final form. Melee characters also have a hard time hitting the mobile aerial units because they were not designed for that. This is especially noticeable for someone with short reach like Tifa who sometimes fails to hit them even if they are right in front of the target in the air.Item uses (not allowed in hard mode by the way) and spells are limited by the ATB bar which you get two charges of. Some skills require one\, others require two. There is a special skill to get three bars for a fight\, but you will rarely have the opportunity to use it\, making it a waste. This is different from previous games\, but they probably wanted to make magic and items more meaningful compared to their other games. But by doing so\, it ends up making a lot of other things in the game like materia linking kind of useless.The game's story is okay\, but the end is rushed. There's a ton of good voice acting too. The problem comes towards the end when a lot of things are not explained and all of Cloud's headaches and freak outs throughout the game are visions that we do not actually see until near the end of the game. This is fairly important\, yet we the player as Cloud never actually see them until the end.Overall\, this feels like a halfway experiment between incorporating the old more turn based elements of the RPG genre with the elements that are normally only found in action games. If they decide to make a sequel\, they should just abandon the older RPG elements in favor of the action elements they are already favoring to make it better rather than try to keep elements they clearly have no interested in just for the sake of nostalgia.… Expand"

I just cannot fathom why Square would allow this? Fair enough they wanted to make it fresh but the ending itself literally makes the events of the game pointless\, classic Rian Johnson type subversion. Make the player think its following the same story\, with little extras that don't impact too much\, but oh wait it seems these little extras are trying to stop the original story from being changed.. last scene.. oh.It's almost as if the 'Plot Armor Ghosts' are Squares representation of all the hardcore purists that wanted what they were made to believe they were getting. A massive slap in the face.The game itself is a marvellous technical achievement\, the amount of detail in Midgar is staggering. I wouldn't call it an amazing RPG in terms of things to do\, but at least they respected the source material right until it starts to unravel. My main criticisms with the game are that the camera can be awful at times\, especially when using lock on. The combat is great unless you're in a tight space. There are very few combinations of gear/materia that are actually worth using in the endgame. Some of the backdrops in the latter 3rd of the game are very low quality\, almost like awful Jpeg's. Some areas of the game take too long and can become a bit tedious.I was ready to give this game a 9/10\, even with the issues it has\, until I saw the ending. I am afraid but also a bit excited of what this all represents for the future instalments in this 'remake'.If you read this far without voting down\, congrats. This wasn't what I was expecting\, and after a couple of days of processing what I've seen\, I am quietly excited about what it means for the future.

74583,FFVIIR,2020-04-13,7,"So I just finished playing through the story\, and I’ve gotta say\, I’m unfortunately disappointed in the direction they took this game in. Allow me to preface that by saying that there’s a lot of good in this game\, though. It’s graphically stunning\, the combat is fun and engaging\, the character development in the first 5 or 6 hours was more than we got in some of SE’s past games (I’m looking at you\, FFXV)\, and Midgar was faithfully re-created and fleshed out. It really felt like what I personally imagined a hyper-realistic Midgar should look like.So why am I disappointed? Simply put: the ending was enough to offset all of the good that this game brought to the table. I understand that this wasn’t supposed to be a beat-for-beat remake of the original Final Fantasy 7\, but the narrative direction that this game was taken to at the very end was chock full of Kingdom Hearts levels of **** It made next to no sense\, especially considering that the game felt very true to the original for a good 90% of the game. Now don’t get me wrong\, I’m a fan of the KH series\, but we have plenty of those games. If I wanted to play a KH game\, I would have popped KH3 into my PS4. The problem is that this game wasn’t supposed to be a convoluted mess of a story. In fact\, the source material was right there for the creators of this game to follow. It didn’t have to be a 1:1 remake for it to feel faithful to the original\, but adding in plot elements like the “Arbiters of Fate”\, and to have the game end with a swarm of them surrounding the Shinra building\, followed by a romp into a portal created by Aerith that leads you to a fight with a giant\, Midgar destroying ripoff of a heartless\, to an Advent Children-esque fight with Sephiroth\, and then topped off with a one-on-one duel between Cloud and Sephiroth where he spouts nonsensical\, lofty\, cryptic dialogue pertaining to “the edge of creation” while the game retcons the events of the past games set in the Final Fantasy 7 sub-universe just left me scratching my head\, and I couldn’t help but feel like I was suckered in and lied to. I’m starting to feel like Square-Enix can’t do anything right anymore. They honestly had one job with this game\, which was to give us Final Fantasy 7\, with some added content that allowed us to see and explore Midgar\, while spacing out the main story points. The sad thing is that that’s essentially what they did\, right before the writers dropped some acid and set to work on writing the ending...I’ll be honest: if you’re looking to play a fun\, engaging\, beautifully designed JRPG and have little to no knowledge of the original Final Fantasy 7\, then I highly recommend that you play this game. However\, If you’re a fan of the original then avoid this game like the plague\, as it’ll only serve to undo what was next to perfectly done back in 1997.… Expand"

And regarding the end\, the game leaves you with an open ending with many possibilities and that provide a great debate to the community about how the story will continue from now on in the following games in this saga that the remake has created.[SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!] I also think that Zack's scene is pure fan-service\, although nobody can deny that this scene is epic and very emotional for fans of the FF7 collection.… Expand"

There are of course many beautiful and emotional scenes\, both those of which we are familiar with and expanded backstories that were handled really well. I teared up multiple times and can’t remember the last time a game impacted me in this way.However\, as much as I wished this were a 10/10 masterpiece\, the experience was held back in many regards. First\, some of the story additions are incredibly lazy and out of place. Most notably\, the ending is absolutely atrocious and convoluted. A major change to the original is not the worst part; the worst part is that the alternative they offer at the end is convoluted KH-level nonsense that implies a complete scrapping of the original source material\, making most of the preceding events completely pointless. I didn’t believe the hearsay\, but yes\, the ending is THAT bad.I also felt like some of the environments were a bit too narrow and corridor-like. Much of the level designs felt very uninspiring\, just point A to point B without much thinking involved. Aspects of the graphics such as the character models and weapons were beautiful\, but it’s also bizarre and jarring to notice that many of the distant views are just static\, slightly blurry\, and flat images (seriously\, the clouds don’t even move). The texture issues that have been mentioned were pretty minor\, but noticeable. While it was fun to take a break from the action and collect materia\, the side quests and added NPCs ranged from bad to mediocre.This was a difficult game to review as the original is one of the most important games of all time to me.

74623,FFVIIR,2020-04-26,9,"Music: 10/10 Boy oh boy\, did they raise the stakes on this one. The scores have been remade into quite honestly a glorious cornucopia of nostalgia\, emotion\, and depth. Each major boss fight has it's own thematic take on the old OST\, transitioning between phases seemingly flawlessly. Imagine 3 separate tracks being produced and recorded\, and being able to overlap and transition seamlessly based on your phase progression. The old classics tug at the heartstrings\, and the remade themes hype you up and make major encounters feel intense.Combat: 9/10 Here's where things diverge. The combat is a fresh take on Active + ATB. The old Materia strategies and setups are still available and will have you altering your slots constantly\, especially for Hard Mode. Each character has their own unique combat style and capabilities\, but you can honestly setup each character however you want to with the new weapon upgrade system. (somewhat tedious\, but adding a bit of depth to stats that can be tailored towards your playstyle) Most players might not understand the true depth and capabilities until they start actively messing with most of the at first seemingly less useful Materia and character swapping actions for ATB growth. I feel like they gave us the best of both worlds with Hack n' Slash + ATB that both new and old fans can appreciate.Gameplay: 7/10 This isn't tied to combat\, it's the overall gameplay. This game is linear. It's meant to be a heavily story focused segment of the main game\, setting up for what the future may bring. That said\, there is inevitable padding (Sewers #2). 3 Chapters involve sidequests in which\, if you decide to do them\, will lengthen the chapter playtime two-three-fold. HOWEVER\, if you don't WANT to do the sidequests\, you don't have to. Miss some pretty strong materia/items? Sure\, but nothing you can't necessarily live without. You can run an entire first playthrough with only main story if you want\, then if you are feeling up to it you can go back in chapter select and replay those chapters for the sidequests and story changes that completing them brings. Your choices matter in a couple of main story scenarios\, but mainly only change cutscenes; albeit gloriously at some moments. The game is sprinkled with some of the old minigames\, and some new ones to boot\, but none will keep you seated there once you have obtained your desired result/trophy.Story: This is the controversial topic among ALL players who have played through the game. That said\, I'm giving this an 8/10. I'd even go so far as to give it a 9/10 up to a point. Bear with me. The added backstories are a nice touch\, generally fleshing out all of the main characters in delightful and even thoughtful ways. Who knew Biggs and Wedge were orphans? That Biggs even lived in and apparently even helped out with an Orphanage in the sector 5 Slums? That Wedge is such a Cat fanatic? That Jessie could POSSIBLY be even more thirsty? The story moments will bring a tear to the eye of any loyal OG Fan\, the voice acting for the main cast is superb (Barret\, you did it right)\, and the banter is goofy and amazing (you can see obvious relationship transitions in the banter throughout the game between the entire cast). The game has these insane highs\, and when going through the main story moments there was hardly a time I was not grinning ear to ear over goofy content or nostalgia\, or being absolutely wrecked emotionally. You get brought along on this rollercoaster of nostalgia and emotion\, carried on the tracks (linearity) by the cast\, and you're loving every damn second of it (minus the padding for some). They are doing absolutely everything right; Sector 7/Wall Market/Shinra HQ and all of the involved characters (and new ones) are expanded and more glorious than you remember... Then it happens. The ending. The rollercoaster reaches it's peak and falls from the greatest height\, you are hyped. You are ready. And then you just ride on a flat and straight road. What is this? Not what you expected? It wasn't what I expected either. At first\, I even hated it. 5/10 random thrown in material\, even. Ruins the story\, right? What changed my mind? Thought. Square didn't change anything about the overall main story so far\, they bring you through this amazing game to this\, what could ultimately RUIN the game and the next installments for everyone. There aren't enough characters available for me to give my overall view\, but I will say this: IRONICALLY\, I trust that SE did not bring us through a 9 or 10/10 story to completely ruin it by the end. I believe there is a plan. If you pay attention throughout the extra story bits\, there are hints at greater possibility. Can certain characters survive where they are meant to die? Is everything uncertain? I don't think so. I believe the games will play out the same as the OG for the most part. Only time will tell\, but keep your mind open to the ending and what it portrays for the future\, and you may be as hyped as me.… Expand"

74626,FFVIIR,2020-04-14,8,"Overall\, an amazing game\, with some minor infuriating points that tarnish the experience slightly. One of these is that basically the musical arrangements are very uneven in quality. Some of the tracks are beautifully rearranged\, but in some other places it completely ruins the experience because of how bad it is\, I'll mention two instances:1-There is a very annoying battle theme that plays about 3 times across the game (the experimental Shinra creatures\, the electric 'centipede' thing and the Shinra combat simulator). This music just takes you back to the bland world of Final Fantasy XIII\, which is not a surprise considering it's the same incompetent and bland composer Masashi Hamauzu. He continues to repeatedly fail at his attempts to change the themes or improvise on them and every single new track in the game is soulless and bland just like him. This guy should never touch another Final Fantasy game in the future. A lot of the themes are completely butchered and made hard to be recognizable.2-The second one is how he ruined the scene with the stairs in the Shinra building. This part of the game is supposed to have a slightly comic element to it\, but this terribly bland composer just puts some generic 'epic' battle music in this part. Completely ruined it for me\, to the point that I had to go to the settings and mute the music.I believe that the music + other minor elements warrant the deduction of 2 points\,  but other than that\, some of the best games in a long time. I just hope the story continues as in the original in the part 2\, and not some alternate realityy version as suggested in the ending.… Expand"

The combat is a great mixture of modern final fantasy and the original ATB system\, that allows for some great combo-ing that results in some truly awesome \""explosions\"" of damage when your whole team executes moves simultaneously.The only major point that people have legitimate feelings of contention towards is the changes in story\, which mostly stem from personal opinions instead of genuinely factual improving or Damaging of the original story. For me personally\, these changes were neither for the better or worse\, they clearly were put there to specifically NOT destroy the original and instead offer a narrative that's both nostalgic for fans as well as giving them something that isn't note for note the same thing again\, whilst also not spoiling story beats for the new people\, though it will likely be slightly less impactful for newcomers as there is a definite focus on giving fans their service.I have to address the BIZARRE argument (From an admittedly small minority) that the game has no subtlety and that all emotional weight has been removed from 'ruined' moments such as Cloud and Aerith's first meeting:This is just wrong. While you may personally enjoy the original versions more for whatever reason\, but between the cinematography\, (mostly) great voice acting/dialogue and absolutely magical soundtrack\, there is no way you can argue such a false notion as a lack of emotion or subtlety.Don't skip out on this game unless you genuinely have no interest in Final fantasy or RPGs. Whether you only care about the story\, or only care about the combat\, both are more than good enough to be worth the price and the amount of content available overall is far surpassing the price tag of the game\, that's if something like game length is a key point for you.… Expand"
74632,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,9,"Square Enix took on a very difficult challenge with Final Fantasy VII Remake. It did so brilliantly\, but not perfectly. I recommend the game whole-heartedly\, though if you are a veteran that wants to play final fantasy VII as it was\, play the ps1 title\, not this one.Let's start with the objective cons\, as they are few :1 :Textures\,Some are blurry\, some are pixelated. The door texture of Marle's buidling in sector seven\, the plate textures\, and some junk textures look like placeholders. Not worthy of a published game.2: Combat :The mp regen is very slow.Some attacks you can't block\, some you can't dodge (dodge had no i-frames)\, some you can't possibly mitigate if you're in an animation\, it feels like a guessing game\, which rewards experience\, but includes a bit of frustration. Lots of animation lock.As a subjective con\, at times the game felt a bit too slow\, in moments where you should feel pressured into going fast. It sort of ruins the momentum created by the story and pulls you out of it.Now onto the pros:It's a very solid game. Everything except some textures is beautiful and polished.The combat looks amazing and feels pretty good to play.The characters are even better than in the original\, as their facial expressions and voice really help give them depth.Spoiler part starts now so don't keep reading if you don't want to be spoiled (though it's a minor spoil in my opinion)Right\, here goes.The game is a remake\, which means follows the core concept and core plot elements of the original but not to the letter. It's not a port\, it's not a remaster\, neither is it a reboot\, too close to the original\, it's a remake\, as it says it is.The whole game felt good to play\, but i wasn't surprised by anything. It felt prectictable\, a bit boring maybe\, though still very enjoyable. That was until the last chapters.The makers of this game had an idea in head all along. That one thing that was completly new and mysterious\, was a hint all along.Maybe that specific traumatic event sparked this idea\, but they decided to make changes feel possible.If changes are possible\, then everything is not safe\, predictable\, and boring.

Its immersive and still retains the tactical element (in tougher fights\, at least) of the original.Pacing: This is where the game stumbles a bit.... in trying to make this a full game's worth of content\, its hard to feel that they didn't pad it out. There is some backtracking\, some questionably long and oddly placed dungeons (looking at you\, Hojo's lab)\, and the side quest are on the basic side. Some of the side quest hubs are also placed at weird points in the narrative\, Chapter 14 in particular. When the main narrative is ramping up and creating stakes\, it just kills it when immediately after the game sends you in search of kids and chocobos.Story: This is the tough one.... many of the story additions and even changes were great. The fleshing out of Avalanche and Wall Market were superb. However\, some of the other changes\, notably regarding character deaths and \""that ending\"" lessen the impact of some of the original's narrative beats and also don't make sense with the themes of the original. Changes aren't bad at all\, but they should make sense and be consistent with the overall narrative.

I'm sorry if you feel like this game didn't live up to your expectations or made choices (whether it be with the story\, combat\, or character development) that ruined you experience. Hopefully SE takes your criticisms and uses them to improve the next chapter of this title. For me thought I had an incredible time from the word go. Are there flaws? Yes\, but some of the greatest games of all time have bugs or minor issues.Story: Personally I had a great time with the story. I enjoyed how it kept many of the core elements while hitting you with curve ball here and there. I understand that many people are not fans of the game ending right when you leave Midgar\, but I did appreciate getting to know some of the side characters more than I did in the previous game. 8.5-10Graphics: Have you ever read a book and while you read how they described a location you envisioned it in  your mind. That's how I felt while seeing certain sights and locations in this game. Yes we saw them before in the first game\, but there was a realism and life breathed into them that made them feel like they could be real. Yes there are some texture issues\, but it would be wrong for me to bring the score down because of the rare amount of times this happened 10/10Music: Immersive and brought back feelings of nostalgia. I won't spoil it but the way they introduce the battle theme is manufique. 10/10Unfortunately I need to end this review with a rant.  One of the biggest gripes I have is not even about the game but with the fan base. I get that it's final fantasy 7\, but there's a \""BIG!!!\"" reason why the first trailer back in 2015 showed the word \""remake\"". I get that many of you wanted it to be the same\, but don't blame SE for making tweaks to the story when they let you know way in advance that there may be some story changes. If you hated the changes that's a discussion for another time\, but don't mark this game down because they were apparently \""lying\"". That would be like review bombing games like \""The last of us:Remastered\"" and \""Call of duty modern warfare Remastered\"" for changing the story when it's clearly just an upgrade of the previous game. And let's face it\, if they did keep it the exact same\, there would still be tons of people whining saying this game is a cash grab attempting to trigger people's nostalgia and not doing anything to improve it. Just my opinion (Rant over)… Expand"

Many were hoping for a fresh coat of paint and some voice acting\, but this does much more than that to the benefit of old and new players. One of the things we loved most in FF7 were the characters and this does an exceptional job in this aspect. Music is amazing. All of the small details were excellently carried out in this game.Some small gripes that I've seen and experienced were resolution quality of textures loading\, especially in sector 7 and 5. I've read that this might be a reoccurring problem of the Unreal engine\, but am not sure\, and would love to see that patched. Running through towns and having NPC dialog spammed at you. I love this detail as it helps to build up the world\, but it could be tweeked. Some areas are also more about taking in information about the world and looking around and there is not much to do. The level designs are not all that interesting or complex as far as the dungeons and fairly linear paths between towns\, but this wasn't too much of a detractor for me because of the good dialog and character development during these segments.And then there is the ending\, which has been divisive to say the least. Most of the very negative ratings seem to be about the \""Kingdom Hearts\"" ending. I had the same thoughts when I first finished this game as well; \""That ending was a big middle finger to the fans\"" and \""They added the ghosts to say we are doing whatever they want now\"". BUT\, as I keep going through theories online\, I think it is starting to make sense.If you have finished FF7 R and absolutely hated the ending\, go to youtube and search for \""spoiler mode FF7 Remake\"" by Easy Allies.

The side quests are nothing to write home about and are also very few. Lastly\, the game is a little too linear for my taste.

74672,FFVIIR,2020-04-14,7,"Here is my list of letdowns:The action RPG elements ruins some of the settings. Instead of making interesting looking places\, the game has to create these open battle fields due to the combat system.Some of my favorite scenes were cut or significantly altered. Climbing up the wall in wall market to the upper plate was changed heavily (the tone wasn't as dark and this section was essentially changed to a generic combat level). The graffiti was toned down and it just had a very different feel.You can't play as Red XIII\, he is included in the game and plays along side you but you have no control over him. This is a major letdown\, because he was my favorite side character of the original. If the game wasn't cut into sections\, Red XIII would be a playable character. Since he is acquired so close to the end of the game\, I think the developers just wanted to postpone adding his weapons\, abilities\, and game-play.The music at times was a letdown\, this I didn't anticipate. The original FF7 has arguably the best video game soundtrack of all time. The remixes in this just had a different tone (some generic electronic music for example was added). I miss the soft piano and the ominous melodies.The padding. Often this game throws overly long battles and battle segments that really slow down the experience.Certain characters who originally died survived. I think this minimizes the bleak tone of the original.The Shinra Sephiroth sequence was changed heavily. My absolute favorite Migard part of the original was when you follow Sephiroth's trail of blood. It was scary\, made Sephiroth feel like a formidably villain. This was changed to a trail of mako gloop. This just ruined the tone of the best Migard section IMO.… Expand"

It's a mix between FF7's OST and FFXIII's \""modern vibe\"". It works just fine with the Remake. Every little (and huge) sound in this game is perfect. It oozes high budget.The combat is also great. It's not perfect\, but it's the natural and positive evolution of FFXV's. It's challenging and rewarding. Pulling off a good ATB combo makes you feel like a badass. The stagger system can make things hard\, but once you figure out what to do\, it's fine.

I'm reffering to story bits and gameplay pieces that just feel out of place. Many things feel out of place in this game. Which leads me to my biggest disappointment: They changed the ending.I won't spoil things\, but basically\, Square paved the way to **** with the original story. They might change everything after what they did by the end of the final chapter. Honestly\, it breaks my heart. Things just got very convoluted and nonsensical. I was not expecting the EXACT same thing\, but I DEFINITELY wasn't expecting whatever happened in the conclusion. I guess I hoped for an upgrade in an already superb story\, but what I got was only 70% of that... Maybe I wouldn't feel this way if this was the FULL remake experience.In the end\, this is an incredible remake. Every Final Fantasy fan should play. Actually\, every RPG fan should play it!

74679,FFVIIR,2020-04-11,5,"I like this game. At times I love it\, but unfortunately at other times I hate the monumental story changes that I wish somebody spoiled it early so I could've cancelled my preorder. Just because Sephiroth is a fan favourite doesn't mean you can squeeze him into every cutscene\, make him the final boss AND give him time travel powers to justify him appearing so early. How will the actual ending even work now that we've already fought him and sliced buildings like it's Advent Children? Square Enix changed up the story just for an \""epic\"" fanfiction fight\, and it will cheapen any use of Sephiroth later.I might be in the minority here but I really don't like how anime this is. All the gasps\, grunts\, moans and exaggerated animations outside main stort cutscenes is super awkward. I thought after FF15 they understood that. I know it's a Japanese production but you don't see Capcom doing this in their games. I don't need an \""ugh-huh\"" every time a character makes a movement.I hate comparing everything with the Witcher 3\, but that game set a standard for how sidequests can be immersive and fun. It also set a standard for detailed and well crafted NPCs\, while in FF7R at one point I saw the same low resolution person copypasted three times in the same frame.

This gameThis is the first console RPG that I have played through in its entirety in the past 7 years. Let that sink in.As a Final Fantasy game\, this game is definitely an amazing experience in terms of gameplay and story. I played the original FF7 as a child. It was and remains one of the greatest games of all time. HOWEVER\, people who criticize the new game are out of their depth. This game brings a new enjoyable experience to market for the franchise. Not only that\, as a writer and editor (yes I'm plugging that)\, the character and plot development are SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL.Characters are far more relatable\, the relationships are meaningful\, and the story arc actually makes sense. I actually CARE when characters die\, and I actually UNDERSTAND why everyone is doing what they are doing as part of the plot. Original FF7 had a lot of \""fill in the blanks\"" with imagination. Us original players of the game had to converse over the phone with our friends or chat on message boards to figure out the plot and make up our own reasoning for a lot of the machinations and conflicts occurring in the game. Sure\, there is something special about that type of story\, however\, not for a wider audience of people who have no investment in the franchise.Music and graphics are impeccable. The remixes of fave songs from the original are all BOPS for people of any music taste. The graphics are so good that its like watching a movie during gameplay... even better than FFXV.The combat system and upgrade system are the best since FFX. They finally perfected the blend between JRPG turn-based and action combat systems. I enjoy the sphere-grid-esque weapon upgrade system. It makes your style of play very customizable.I'm so pleased with the game. Is it missing some elements? Yes. But knowing that there is more to come makes it all the sweeter.… Expand"

The only thing I noticed thus far is that certain background textures are graphically out of place\, but due to certain recent world events I suspect this is due to not being able to polish the final product properly as they previously planned in their release date extension. I suspect the low reviews are due to the fact that the ending puts the developers in the reigns of fate and gives them complete freedom to do something new to the story. The first Final Fantasy 7 game is my favorite game of all time and I for one was not excited to play the exact same game that I’ve been playing for the last 23 years because I feel that the original is already perfect. I wanted something new and creatively fresh and to my delighted surprise\, Im getting it here. Entertainment is subjective and ppl are free to feel what they feel in their respective entertainment mediums\, but to give a game that is not broken in anyway a 0/10 is completely laughable and dishonest and it’s clearly not warranted here.

The odd shout outs to the old game are nice but others are horribly misplaced and you see the same mechanic being applied to a different area. It feels like they rushed the end of this game too. The Shinra building section is one of the most boring bits of a game I’ve ever played and the fact that Red isn’t a playable character (the game gives a text box reason for this) proves that they ran out of time.Overall very disappointing.

The graphics are top notch and the gameplay was pretty solid\, consider that it is an improved version of Final Fantasy XIII's gameplay (a game I strongly disliked\, including its gameplay).Cons:What holds me back from saying it's a fantastic game is the pacing of the story and the endgame stuff\, basically anything after chapter 18. There are too many areas that are full of superfluous content and was unnecessary. Some of the boss fights took way too long and didn't have interesting tactics to win\, which messed up the pacing. Other times\, I could miss with moves such as limit breaks\, which should always hit due to the nature of the attack. Sometimes combos got interrupted by cheap attacks. Also\, the ghosts appearing in the game was incredibly stupid.  Also\, compared to Final Fantasy VII original\, this is not a complete story.

The graphics and music are amazing and pay great homage to the original.   I was so excited to hear they were expanding the game and possibly clarifying some of the gaps that the original PS game had left open.  This is a remake / re-writing of the original it's important to accept that.  The game makes it clear early enough adding characters and side quests that didn't exist before.   Here is where my issues lie.  I am 100% on board for extended and more fleshed out story but I do not want filler or bad story telling... and that's a good portion of what I got from the first 10 hours of the game.The side quests and town stuff drags.  It's jarring how badly the side quets dip in quality as compared to the main story.  By the end I was skipping optional content because it was making me hate the game.  I may have lost out on some decent story that was sprinkled into the side quests but I couldn't have been bothered to sift through the BAD storytelling.  I even felt that some of the early events with the main avalanche team just felt bland.  I wanted to move on from that section of the game.  The game tips at one point at a certain train-yard and i feel like the story telling goes back to being off the charts in a good way and if you ignore the side quests you are basically on the rails for great story\, great characters\, amazing environments\, and epic battles.The end opened up allot for the follow up games which I will be playing but I don't know if I'll be buying them day one.  I'm no longer blindly trusting the series.  I think this game would be an A+ if it didn't expand and add sub-par side quests featuring cardboard cutouts for characters.The combat did nothing for me and the original is vastly better in this area.  It's not bad\, it's just not really fun and that's a bit of an issue for a video game.   I'd honestly say put it on 'easy' and the only difference you will feel is that you will be stopping to heal less often.… Expand"

I tell you that so you know what colours my experience with this remake.On the whole\, I really liked this! There are pacing issues and story issues and remake issues but overall this improves my engagement with the story as a whole. I think one of its faults is you MUST know the original FF7 to really \""engage with the text\"".I think the Kingdom Hearts-esque combat and the story will be enough for people new to the story to hold on to but to really appreciate what it is doing and where it is going an understanding of its subversion is needed.The fact that the original came out before 9/11 and this one is after that is truly reflected in the story even though this is a Japanese game it is impossible not to see certain parallels. I like that it has really leftist political talking points\, even if it sometimes fumbles it\, I think it does some good stuff. Unfortunately\, it also seems like a Libertarian can also feel like their beliefs are being reflected.The give-and-take I feel is reflected in the final hours. I love the story\, the lore\, and where the narrative went... BUT\, the combat suddenly flips you around in different party settings in a way that bogs you down with managing builds and materia. Like the fighting gets in the way of keeping the pace.All-in-all this has me more interested in the future of the series where before I was not interested or excited about this game at all.… Expand"

This game has amazing graphics and I like the added components in both the story and Midgar. I thought they did well with the battle mechanics\, and boss fights were wild...But that's all it was. It missed the mark on the most important thing\, IMO\, being fun. I have always loved RPG's because they gave you the ability to grind a little\, or do a few side quests earlier that made you a beast during the main story. This game is played linear and in chapters like a really poor man's Devil May Cry\, but instead of being fun and exciting\, it was littered with orange cones and boxes you can knock over and uneventful side missions which essentially amounted to \""fetch\"" quests. The enemies that do exist are too sparse and bland and while the materia spells are great- there is no materia out there to get that gives you anything close to that double cast\, \""Knights of the Round\"" type of power. The game just lost my desire to play it as I treked along to the next boss\, there was nothing to work torward. Since there are no real ways to grind experience or level anything up\, you are stuck playing the game with generally an underdeveloped character which felt like a ploy to make the game last longer (fights would take longer and you would die more often). They offer hope with a little replayability by giving you a level select after you beat it\, sprinkled with a couple more weapon points - which do little to nothing for you at that point. I platinum about 95% of games I play\, so I started a hard run. With maxed out characters and materia I was one shoted by a jump attack from a basic lizard man\, and called it quits shortly after that. And in hard mode there is no refilling your MP on any level\, the rest stops only do HP.  The high level spells cost about a quarter of your MP and there are some ways to slightly mitigate that\, but dang.  If you desire learning strengths and weaknesses\, trying and failing\, and developing strategies then this may be more for you than it was me. I like owning things and being able to use the cool spells in the game but\, FF7R seems to not want you to do that. It's too hard to  maintain any MP and to build ATB to use them.

Characters and Midgar look amazing!But what really separates the game from everything else out there are the memorable characters\, the iconic world design\, incl. enemies\, and the story. Those are more like 12/10.Characters: Think about it: How many video game characters besides the main cast can you remember overall? I can remember almost all characters from original FF7 vividly\, and they are even better flashed out here. I always liked FF7 best\, because I could not relate to the fantasy characters of e.g. FF9. I am not a small kid with a tail and all the princess and magic stuff I like to watch and read\, but just wasn't so relatable playing it. Now\, while FF7 characters are all over the top in the typical Japanese way (which I love\, this is not meant to be dead serious\, realistic people)\, I can relate to Cloud and all the other cast\, since they have very human characteristics.And the world design and story: It is more relevant than ever. A planet being sucked dry by greedy corporate types\, with poor people living in slums literally beneath the rich. Sounds familiar? This setting I always found much more appealing than the pure Fantasy setting\, since it has a message and relevance that pure Dungeons and Dragons just cannot have. With the improved graphics\, voice acting\, and story detail\, these dystopian aspects are shown so much more detailed this time.To the critic points of others: I don't understand the complaints about \""filler content\"". Quests are optional\, and are much the same as in FF12 or Yakuza series. If you don't like them\, just focus on the main story. And as described above\, I actually like the main story parts going into more detail than the original. If people still complain that it is released in parts\, and that in this part you cannot play later parts\, it is a bit silly. What you get here is much more than what you get in most other games\, and again the overall experience is almost standalone excellent.So overall clear 10/10. Must play.

Battle mechanics are fun and easy enough to learn. So the infrastructure for a great game is there\, however 2 things are worth noting as a let down. Area traversal is to put it briefly\, cumbersome. You are constantly forced to walk when you want to run you are often following an other character and if they are walking so are you\, lots of really slow movement that just kills the momentum. The second issue is the story. It's a shell of the original\, there are quite a few plot holes. A lot of it feels hollow and trite. I'm still enjoying my playthrough but if I didn't have a previous emotional connection with the characters I would probably pass on this game.… Expand"

It really felt like a full fledged triple A game even though it only covered about 10% of the original FF7 story. Detractors will bomb the reviews with 0 cause they can't see past the purpose of the ending. If we keep an open mind with regard to the ending\, 95% of the rest of game was pure gold.FF7 Remake told the original story but added so much more. Things that didn't make sense in the original makes sense now. Things that were not explained properly are explained in greater detail now. The story was a roller coaster ride. It made us question ourselves at times. It made us entertained and laugh at times. It made us love to hate some of the characters. It made us really sad many times. The writing was top-notched. It did justice to the original by keeping the feel of FF7\, and even betters it.The battle system is finally a good blend of action and turn based. It keeps you on your toes at every moment. It takes a while to master. But once you know the mechanics\, it is just pure joy. There is so much customisation with the Materia and so many possibilities with the abilities. The fact that there are now so many videos on different Materia builds to conquer hard mode is a testament to how good the battle system is.The voice acting was also one of the best in any video games. Every character was brought to life. The top tier voice acting together with the realistic facial expressions gave us movie quality cut-scenes. And when characters have tragic moments\, it was hard to not shed a tear.Music in this game is undoubtedly the OST of the year. There is not one track that is average. Majority of the tracks are top tier\, the rest are very good. The music really added to the story telling.This game was a dream for so many people. And the expectations were sky high.The fact that Square Enix managed to pull this off is a miracle. Credits to all the staff. This project wouldn't have been easy at all.Let us all enjoy the ride\, embrace it and have faith that Square Enix knows what they are doing.… Expand"

This will only be a quick review basically to some criticism being leveled at the game which can be justified but there are counters. Yes\, it can feel bloated with side quests which are repetitive\, however the extra time this affords you with certain characters can not be underestimated\, giving more breathing room for dialogue and interaction with the world around you and with said character's  by your side. This works feels real and alive in a way it never has before\, with a narrative depth dug deeper with every event no matter how small or how important to the main story. At the end of my gameplay I knew these people\, this world more than I ever thought possible and became more emotionally attached then I thought possible. With probably the best voice acting (with that extra needed\, special final fantasy cheese) which is entertaining and enduring. The story itself does change dramatically\, but to say any more would spoil events to come. Despite some texture issues this is a beautiful world\, so much care has gone into the character models and the world itself it blends into the narrative to create a jaw dropping experience.

74813,FFVIIR,2020-04-20,5,"This game steals failure from the jaws of success. All but the last hour of the game is an absolutely mindblowing recreation of the first bit of the original FF7.Story: (3/10)\n==========\nThe recreation is far superior in nearly every way\, which is frustrating as the alterations at the end and throughout the story are childish\, idiotic\, nonsensical and ruins work they achieved here.This game steals failure from the jaws of success. All but the last hour of the game is an absolutely mindblowing recreation of the first bit of the original FF7.Story: (3/10)==========The recreation is far superior in nearly every way\, which is frustrating as the alterations at the end and throughout the story are childish\, idiotic\, nonsensical and ruins work they achieved here. These alterations are no different than teenage fan-fiction\, taking what was cool about the original story and perverting it with childish concepts that miss the whole point of the original plot.If you thought final fantasy has been in a decline since the days of old\, they've brought that stale decline to the classics as well. For new players\, the new stuff will make absolutely no sense to you as they bring up plot points that you'd only understand if you played the original game.The new story line elements spoil or ruin nearly every major story element in the original game. All possibility of including\, in a later sequel\, what made Final Fantasy 7 a great story has been effectively eliminated by the cheap\, non-sensical and childish alterations the writers of this game included. This is a shame as they did a perfect remake of the midgar part and it would have been amazing to see them recreate the parts that actually made FF7 great.I had lost confidence in squaresoft's ability to produce good content a while ago\, and this just confirms what I already knew about the writers at this company. If only they stuck to the original plot instead of fumbling their way through making a new plot.Game Mechanics (10/10)=====================The battle system is astronomically good. They managed to perfect the combat system that started with final fantasy 1 with modernizations from the modern era. Their past attempts (FF15\, FF13) have been sloppy in comparison to the strategic ATB of the days of old\, but this includes the best of high action combat and strategic RPG mechanics.My only gripe about the system is that you cannot fully explore it with access to the limited materia included in this game. Another issue is that there are some quality of life improvements needed\, like the range of attacks being displayed on the battlefield\, or materia swapping between characters.Quests (4/10)===========With games like the Witcher 3 or Skyrim\, RPG quests have come a long way from the old days; yet Final Fantasy is still stuck in the past. You literally have a \""find all the X\"" quest appear a few times\, and the rest are just \""kill or fetch\"" quests. They have little story to them what-so-ever. Luckily the main story quests are stunning and have nice\, albeit linear dungeons to explore. This is a linear part of the game\, so the linearity is acceptable.One major gripe I have over the side quests is that they reuse many of the dungeons multiple times.Acting (10/10)============The acting is absolutely amazing. It's on the level of being on par with full feature film. The character models portray emotions and there isn't a single main character that falls behind in this regard.GraphicsArt Style (10/10)======================The game is stunning\, and the design of the world is something unique. The amount of detail put into the world is amazing\, and the graphics engine is used to the fullest of it's potential to show that detail to you. The combat is so cinematic you feel like you're watching an action movie as you play.Music (10/10)===========Not only do they remake the entire original music score\, they expertly place these scores\, and many variations of them\, at perfect places in the game. It sounds like going to an opera\, and honestly is so overwhelmingly epic that my heart was racing the entire time. The don't over-do any of the themes either so they are always fresh. It's perfect.Overall Feel (5/10)================I feel like this was a perfect 10/10 masterpiece of a game that had some aberrant and immature child come in\, with authority\, and mar it with new and terrible story elements. It is like being fed a perfect meal from a 3 Michelin star restaurant but finding something tastes a bit off. As you eat and enjoy your meal the taste gets worse and worse till you find out there is a dead rat at the bottom of your dish. Yes\, it was mostly great\, but you can't get over that dead rat\, which is a representation of the poor storyline elements and the boring quests.… Expand"

The voice acting is superb and the audio while playing is great. From Barret's one liners to Jessie hitting on Cloud\, even listening to the background voice as you walk through a section of town is great.The battles are awesome and and you can choose if you want it to be simplistic or more challenging. With many original monsters making a reappearance.I like everything about this game but here is why it only got a 5.I did not read up on anything about this game pre-release so I could be totally surprised by everything and enjoy it all. Everything was going great. Then the game ended and I was not even out of Midgar\,ARE YOU JOKING ME!!! Looks like SE is going to make this into a three part series I would guess. While some may enjoy that I do not. Yes it makes the overall game larger but it also means we as players wont be done it until 2023\, provided they release the next part every year and I doubt that is going to happen but it sure as hell better. If they do it every two years then we will be done this series by 2026. No way this game is just a two part series as Midgar was the first game. If I recall the game took place over a few towns and areas of the world map. Yes they really fleshed out Midgar with a town more to do and it was great but now I have to buy another game/DLC maybe two at $79.99 CAD each I am guessing. MONEY GRAB!!

The visuals are top notch and even though things like oddly low resolution textures are well documented\, the game is always a visual treat. As one who loved advent children\, the game is just like having the visuals of the CGI masterpiece as the full blown game. The music is also nothing short of amazing. I have heard the original music get remade for decades but some how this game does it again and they are awesome arrangements.As someone who is not an action hack and slash gamer I am still getting used to the gameplay\, and I do really like it but I still get my actions jumbled frequently. Thankfully the games easy/classic mode offers a helping hand to people like me.Lastly I must comment about the english voice acting. I have not heard this good of english dubs since Final fantasy 12. I almost always toggle Japanese voices when possible as I always find the original game director picks out the more perfect voice matches to the character than the guy just handling the english dub and his usually limited choice in actors. In the english dub it is the opposite. The English VAs are mostly perfect\, while the japanese ones are fine for the most part but I don't like cloud or barret. Barret isn't gruff enough and cloud sounds more like your teen antagonist from anime. This is a bit different from say the Advent children movie where the japanese VA was more on quick lines and heavily carried on the \""I'm not sure if I care\"" attitude. This is where the english VA carried this beautifully.Lastly is the script. It is exciting to see the dialogue in the game is written very much in the same way we saw in the original FF7. It is hard for me to explain but the content and style just emulated it perfectly. It is different from more modern script writing\, and lines that I usually would find edited out of the english translation are kept in tact. Again this is probably related to FF7s more raw translation before games started removing content from english translations fearing the reader may not understand some things about Japanese culture.I heave a feeling the next one will be the reason I will buy the ps5. Final fantasies usually are the reason I plunk down on the latest console but this would be a first that it would be for a remake.… Expand"

74825,FFVIIR,2020-04-13,10,"What an amazing game! I recommend that you treat this as a sequel to the current titles in the FF7 compilation. The reason being that this game takes place in an alternate timeline to the original\, and the characters actively subvert the original timeline's events by the end of the game. I am so excited to get to have new experiences with the characters and locations we know and love in future installments. This is definitely not a replacement for FF7\, but a new game in its own right. The game assumes you are familiar with several characters already including Zack Fair\, Sephiroth\, and Rufus Shinra.The combat is excellent on Normal mode and somewhat of a cakewalk in easy and classic modes\, but you can switch between them very easily. The combat system is deep and engaging. It avoids being button-mashy\, while still presenting itself in a very easy-to-understand manner.The story is fairly linear with some choices and branching paths which do not have an effect on the overall story. There are at least 20 side quests\, most of which are very engaging. Completing the game unlocks chapter select which allows the player to return to previous moments of the game and grab any items and experience any other branches they didn't get to on their first play-through.The visual and audio quality were very good with some tiny hiccups where the game loads hi-res models in the background\, but the amount of diversity and uniqueness of texture more than makes up for it.Overall: This game is made for people that have already played through FF7 and want to experience more game play in that world by offering an interesting story taking place in an alternate timeline.… Expand"

74832,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,8,"I've spent a lot of hours and days into FFVII when it came out years back. I can still describe the story and the imagery of the locations of all the cities and what takes place. My heart and soul is into the story line of Final Fantasy VII more than any other FF game out there. Now\, with that being said\, I do have mix feelings about this game as much as I want to devour the passion and the story line that I know; I'm not sure if I feel that magic yet.Characters and graphics are gorgeous. I appreciate the time they took\, to create and concentrate on Midgar. I love how the characters make comments when you have control and they talk about whatever situation that your in\, at that time. I think that's truly a huge game changer when you hear more dialogue\, it really makes you feel that 'you're\"" part of them.I think Cloud should have sections in the game where he is ~ Thinking~ about the flashbacks and visions he has and how he feels about it. I don't know what Cloud is thinking\, and I want to know. Don't make him brainless. Aerith I feel is the same way\, she doesn't tell you much about what's going on and it's confusing what's going on in her head as well.I do enjoy the new combat system where you can control the characters on whim\, we 'should' be able to control Red XIII\, I think at the end of this game they just wanted to hurry up and get it out and didn't want to add that feature but Red wants to join the team\, so let him join! The combat system gave me a lot of control on how I want to play the game and use abilities. My only CON: Why can't I use Items whenever I want? Why do I need to rack up ATB I mid as well use Cura and have my other characters give me ethers.  Also\, not sure how Summons are actually summoned\, I really did just grind into this game and just never went to bed for like three days. It doesn't give you a choice to choose a summon\, so you'll need to research the schematics of how everything works in this game\, which they have a built one into the game as a reference\, that I did use from time to time.Everyone loves the music\, I was meh. I miss the old combat music that I actually used as a ringtone but  they did slip in some old FF music that I did love.These plots with the Whispers\, ummm I get it\, sort of\, but is it necessary?It seems confusing and Red should be able to tune in with the planet\, not because Aerith touch him\, a bit corny.The main plot with Shinra is clear and incredible but confused on the Whispers\, and it's a bit confusion with the guys with numbers on them\, no explanation for new players who don't know the story line.Materia aspect is great as well as the SP\, but the weapons are a bit confusion\, at least for Cloud. I upgraded the Hardedge to do about 200 atk and the in the walk-throughs everyone suggested to use the Twin Stringer to use Counterstance against Sephiroth and I didn't  need too. I fought each boss it seemed\, ab bit quicker with the Hardedge\, which disappoints me that upgrading weapons isn't up to par\, as much as I would like it to be.Side quest and Map: It should 'make' you do these\, since I missed out on a lot of cool stuff\, but *Spoiler* once you finish the game\, you can replay any chapter for any missing content\, which is a bonus. I think that tracking the side quest seemed a bit off and couldn't track them as easily as I would like them too to complete it a bit faster.  I love Sam (I did pick that up btw) but the map for his chocobos and the regular map you use to travel\, seems a bit off and was frustrated at times until I got the hang of it but cool mechanism\, just needs to be polished.I give this score an 8 because I love immensely the graphics\, they are phenomenal\, background stories of the characters are  phenomenal\, we needed this\, combat system good and slightly bad\, plots both good and bad\, Materia great\, SP to upgrade weapons good system but expected to have better weapons as you progress through the story. I only used two weapons through this entire game for Cloud.  Aerith and Cloud need to have more 'inner' time to let 'you' in on their emotions since they are the main characters and deep rooted into the core of the game. Also the mapping system and tracking quest could be polished a bit more.I hope that it doesn't take them 3 years to add DLC to this game and they read through some of these comments people have made\, to try and understand what our different prospective are\, to add maybe some light into this game.I still recommended to play this game and hope for new content soon!… Expand"

It is a Hybrid Action Turn based games really love the slow-mo moment when you can rotate the character and think how to beat the enemies.The Battle is not just mashing buttons like FFXV and KH3 it is about strategy and building it you need to observe the enemy that makes this game battle not boring at all. different enemies different beatdown manner.Every Boss battle was memorable for me their have every stage with different approach to beat theme i really love it.Music in gameThis piece of OST is magnificently done by the team they turn the old piece of theme into the new fantastic piece\, they place the music so fit in the story the moment the event in everything that match the atmospher so well.Final Fantasy VII Remake not lost it's \""magical captivity\"" that is there in the Original FFVII which that magical push of magic that made you want to play the game more and more and make this game not boring at all.like the previous KH3 and FFXV which get boring in certain parts of the game.Overall this game is worth to buy and play what lack are  materia\, Skill\, Limit\, Weapon\, we need more of them maybe because this is just the first part of the game.i guess if in normal mode you there is no that \""magical chair\"" and you save only in certain point in this game it will be more challenging\,andddit is not a full game!which is impossible to be just release within one.What leaves the this game not rated so good is the \""Controversial\"" step that Square enix took from this game.But i Dare to say i dare to see what kind of step that they would take and very looking forward to it!… Expand"

When you're controlling one character at a time\, the AI on whoever you're not currently playing as can sometimes make stupid choices\, like not moving out of the way of an enemy's attack or running into combat when they're nearly about to die.

Also due to the fact that far too many areas that took five minutes in the classical game have been needlessly expanded into hour long slogs of fighting and running down linear halls\, only enjoyable for any banter within the party\, and only serving to pad out the game when the original claim was that they struggled to fit more than Midgar into the first entry. If you removed two thirds of the padding\, only leaving the sidequests tied to the original game (such as those in Wall Street)\, you would have had a tighter experience that could have stretched to Kalm.All these things are knitpicks through.

This game really hits out the park where it needs it to be Emotional\, Nostalgia\, Music\, Combat\, Characters and etc.  Around 95% of this game is a master piece aside from ending. The story depends how well the story plays out the next parts until then i can't really gives it a score. No game is perfect there's is some textures problem in this game although there are times i don't believe its ps4 game on how well its looks. Not bothered that is not a full game from the original since they fleshed out midgar to be a full game play experience. As well i rather they take full advantage next gen console for open world aspects of the game 60 fps and faster loading times would make it much better experience\, so i do think they did the right call there.Postive:+ Amazing combat system a staple for next parts+ Music is a Masterpiece captures emotion and environment perfectly+ Nailed the characters+ Good VA+ The game feels alive+ Capture environment of the original+ Difficulty is Challenging and funNegatives- Linear level design but expected- Some textures and NPC character problems… Expand"

Long time fans of the hit action RPG will certainly find this a thrill ride down nostalgia lane with a slap to the face of breathtaking visuals\, and sound design\, especially when it comes to the re-imagined soundtrack. New comers may not be hit with the same feeling however\, they'll be blown away by the same factors for sure\, but may feel a bit underwhelmed by the basic combat system\, sub-par level design which lacks an open world\, and mediocre side quests. The story remains\, of course\, true to the original\, but there are a few new twists that will leave new comers wanting more\, and call into question what fans already know\, leaving a lot of intrigue for both of those people. This\, along with the voice casts near-flawless depictions of the characters will have you wanting more long after it's over.I want to take a minute to regard the soundtrack further\, the new re-imagining of these classics will leave you astounded. Whether it be\, \""Let the Battles begin!\"" \""Those who Fight\"" \""Crazy Motorcycle Chase\"" or even one other track which I won't spoil. The original artist and his team have truly outdone themselves.As a long time fan of the orginal\, I will give this game a 9/10. As a critic\, I can see the small areas where the REMAKE falls just a tad bit short. If I was more of a critic\, I would give it a 7 or 8. However\, despite that fact\, I find it incredibly confusing and unbelievable that some supposed \""fans\"" of the original game give this a 0/10\, it's darn near criminal\, this is a fantastic game that will leave anyone who plays it breathless\, and wanting more.As for negatives\, again\, the combat system is very simplistic mechanic wise\, but the original was that way too. Aerial combat is specifically bothersome\, as it doesn't allow for variety when aerial\, the best bet at this point is to use one of the ranged characters\, but it seems upsetting when the main character is known for being an agile warrior\, even when airbourne. There are some texture issues here and there\, but they're far and few between to notice\, the only one that popped out for me was one of the metal doors. The weapon upgrade system can be a bit tedious\, but manageable. Level design and pacing is a bit droll at times. It's really just \""do the thing\, then go here.\"" Other than those few minor elements\, no complaints. I can tell Square Enix put a lot of time and effort into this\, and it does show.In conclusion\, I would highly recommend this to anyone\, gamer\, or casual.… Expand"

However\, it turned out that battle system here is the best one I've ever played in my 20 yrs gaming life. It blends so well between action and turnbase. On the other hand\, the story of FFVII\, which should be the apex of gaming\, has become somewhat questionable in remake. I don't want to spoil anything here let say the story is disappointed in my view. Not only it became super extended (which I felt bored in some sections)\, It also added some annoying things\, which made the story hard to understand especially for new comers. The pacing is quite slow. Sidequests\, only few I like\, mostly are uninteresting.  Final chapter is more like FFVII advent children style\, very exciting but vaguely understandable.On the bright side\, not only combat is very amazing\, the animation and voice actors are top-notch as well. Characters look very beautiful. Moreover\, enemy variety here is godly superb. There are so many of them and each one is different. I never played any game that has these many types of enemy before. It is mind blowing how much effort devs put in this game. Music is perfect too. I always love ost of FFVII and the remake did it even better.In summary\, FFVII remake is an outstanding game and contender of GOTY for sure.

Square Enix ha letteralmente violentato un capolavoro per creare un gioco privo di anima e corpo. Non è un remake\, non so descrivere neppure cosa sia. Innanzitutto il sistema ad episodi poteva benissimo essere superato\, poiché la scusa della dimensione originale non regge\, basti pensare a Dragon Quest XI che a livello di grandezza e contenuti se lo mangia a FFVII\, quello per PS1. Il sistema di comabttimento l'ho trovato confusionario e frustrante\, la sfida non tiene conto dei progressi dei personaggi\, i combattimenti sono o inesistenti\, o snervanti. Più che un gioco di ruolo sembra un gioco di combattimento\, uno Street of Rage con i personaggi Square. Un remake avrebbe dovuto tenere conto di ciò. La grafica è meravigliosa per i personaggi\, che battono i modelli in CG di Advent Children (... anche se è un film di 10 anni )\, tuttavia il resto è altalenante\, con scorci bellissimi\, ma anche texture che sfigurerebbero su una PS2. Secondo me i programmatori non si sono sforzati più di tanti per ottimizzare il motore grafico (il paragone è sempre Dragon Quest XI...meraviglioso). La cosa peggiore del gioco alla fine è la trama\, massacrata da un concept assurdo e imbarazzante. Un consiglio per in fan di FFVII\, state alla larga\, questo non è un remake\, ma la reinterpretazione di una software house che cerca di innovare\, ma che crea mostri (in senso negativo) di giochi.

74902,FFVIIR,2020-06-20,6,"The game is constantly moaning for having be a remake instead of something different\, with the devs changing things just to show how the whispers force them to stay in line with the original plot because the bad fans want it. This until the final part\, when they totally unleash their desire for doing another game and totally ruin what was an otherwise impressive work.If Nomura and the devs hated so much doing this remake\, because they thought they were so good that they could do better\, why haven’t they just said that they weren’t doing it? It would have been more honest and respectful for the original game and the fans who were waiting this for more than 15 years.Given the reception of FFXIII and FFIV\, which were among the worst episodes of the series\, I don’t see how could they feel entitled to think that they were still able to do something at the level of the original game\, not to mention something better. Approaching this remake with more humbleness would have maybe reminded them how to make good games.Instead the decision was to be arrogant and diverge from the original story in a way that doesn’t make sense for new players\, shows important plot events way too early (never seen a game spoilering itself)\, takes from inferior material such as Advent Children or games having nothing to do with FF7 such as Kingdom Hearts\, and adds a level of meta gaming that was totally unneeded nor requested for a remake. As result there’s explosions and things like cutting trains in two\, but the story is ruined.The only thing that saves the game is that you can enjoy the first 90% (if you ignore Sephiroth’s annoying apparitions and Whispers) and pretend that the ending is before entering that portal.This is Nomura’s ego ruining an otherwise great game.

Like that was just to much\, but i liked the story."
74912,FFVIIR,2020-07-28,3,"What a shame.I will set my stall out as an FFVII nostalgist. I have played the original through four or five times in the last twenty years or so. I don't think it's perfect by any means\, but even now\, I think it holds up as a high point in game design.I was quietly optimistic about this game. Given that I haven't really enjoyed a Square game since FFXII some fifteen years ago\, I had hoped they would stow away some of the habits that have made their recent releases unsatisfying. Broadly though\, they have not\, and the result is disappointing. First\, the positives. The music is sublime. The mixing sometimes leaves something to be desired\, and the new tracks are quite bland\, but the remixes of the original tunes are mostly excellent. That the best tune is reserved for a squatting minigame is also quite funny.The graphics are terrific. Midgar is well-realised\, and the sense of oppression from the great megalopolis is there in spades. Wall Market felt like a Midgar version of Kabukicho\, and the seediness and neon beauty really shone. The high camp of the Honeybee Inn was a lot of fun\, though the dance minigame felt hastily added and tacked on.Now\, the faults. The reimagined story is confused and boring\, in the main. Stretching out the original beats with mindless corridor wandering and backtracking is just lazy game design. Mostly\, I felt no impetus to proceed. Too often\, the characters wander around looking for a lever\, or a switch\, or explain the bleeding obvious. Not only does adding padding like Jessie's story make for unfocused storytelling\, it detracts from the better parts of the original story. It made me like the characters less. And retconning the original story\, to justify chopping up the original game to sell over a period of years\, is heinous in the extreme. The early arrival of Sephiroth and the plot-altering ghosts are just egregious\, and add nothing whatsoever to the story. It's akin to re-releasing Lord of the Rings\, and adding a metaverse in which ghosts try to prevent Frodo from destroying the ring\, every five minutes. I couldn't say whether this addition came about as a result of Square's greed\, or Nomura's overinflated ego\, but regardless\, it leaves a sour taste. The attempted fleshing out of bit players from the original did nothing to add more engagement to any of their stories or personalities. It simply felt hollow.The combat feels like they have tried to marry two gameplay types\, and have been left with the faults of both. Pausing frequently to navigate a sub menu\, spells and attacks whiffing all too often\, boss fights which seem unending\, and a poorly implemented stagger system add up to an ultimately unsatisfactory outcome. All it made me think was that I'd much rather be playing DMC5\, or Yakuza 0\, or Nier Automata\, or any number of games whose action battle systems are much more fun. The levelling up of weapons and frequent rearrangement of materia are little more than a chore\, and feel like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic\, for all the difference it makes. In the end\, mashing □ was 90% of what was required.The voice acting was acceptable at best\, though as others have highlighted\, once you notice the anime grunting\, it is very distracting. I suppose there are few examples of a reimagined version of a classic being as good as\, or better than\, the original. And Square's recent handling of the final\, wholly unedifying episode in the Kingdom Hearts series might have given me a hint as to the quality of this project. And indeed\, the original will remain a quality game in spite of this experience. But the cynical way this game has been constructed leaves me feeling hard done by.So much more could have been made of this. When games like Persona 5 are so satisfying and inventive that I basically buy it twice\, there is no excuse for Square putting out an inferior JRPG in this day and age.… Expand"

It's very balanced\, action packed and diversed.Ennviroment.The enviroment could be better. It is beautiful to look at but it rather feels like you cannot that much interact with it. For example if you slash your sword at the wall there is no satisfying sparkles and sound  there. Of course there are some elements that you can slash or push but it feels rather forced just to have something there that can be hit.Areas:This installment is quite linear which is understandable based on the story arc of the game. Still I wished we had little bit more open exploration areas in the game. I felt like it was missing if it is a standalone game.Story(spoiler):I loved every bit of it\, it felt nostalgic and exciting. I loved how they expanded the whole experiance\, gave us more insight and more scenes. I loved how the Shinra had human elements. Soldiers not sure if this is right etc. Made them feel more real. Same with the citizens. They were manipulated with news and goverment and dint see the bigger picture. I could see this happenning in the real life too.The ending left me shocked and surprised.

The ending is a massive middle finger\, the cutscene at least\, it completely changes the entire story for no reason apart from a cliffhanger to get you to play episode 2 which is just poor from square enix\, they know fans are going to buy the game so why change this enormous plot point.

When remaking a game\, the developerRemake or Retelling?FFVII is a beloved game to many gamers and that love stems from a story and world that was so richly and well developed in the original game. Plus it has spanned over 20 years and has been the most well known series for SquareEnix since its massive success in 1997. So\, it goes without saying a remake would be VERY controversial. When remaking a game\, the developer can either make the EXACT same game\, or they can make some with some changes. With this iteration of FFVII\, Square tried to walk a tight rope. The game offer the overarching story of the original but adds in additional context throughout. Overall\, you are going to the same places\, fighting the same enemies you fought in the original\, nothing has been removed. And\, in addition\, new enemies and locations have been opened. The main villain of the series has received more attention than before and the overarching story has been given more depth. For some people\, this makes the game a greater experience\, but for others it detracts from their childhood memories. This I believe is the main point of frustration for many people because outside of this point\, the game is amazing.Graphics: In my play-through I encountered 97% of the content in splendid rendering\, beautiful set pieces\, and flashy attack make the game shine. 3% of the time I was looking at something that was blurry and pixel-ated. Overall\, the graphics were amazing and beautiful\, I spend many a fight\, looking around at the surroundings.Gameplay: The combat system in VII is an aggregation of the FFXIII\, FFXV and Kingdom Hearts battle systems\, with the original VII being the ultimate guiding light for how battles will unfold. You have new attacks\, and weapons that level up to become even more powerful\, making weapons from the past that were useless (I'm looking at you buster sword) very useful now. MATERIA! is in the game and all the better in the remake. I personally LOVE the materia system\, its the best magic system in any Final Fantasy and it rewards you for exploring and playing with your materia loadouts. I wont spoil much here\, but I will say\, I have my most fun when I'm tweaking my materia to achieve some new impact to the way a spell works. Summons are also in the game and unlike the previous game\, they now fight with you. I was very fortunate in that my summons were constantly able to be summoned\, but some have complained that they don't work like the original\, where the summon just inflicts a damage dealing attack. I personally prefer the presences of the summons and ability to utilize them more in combat.Sound: Simply amazing. I have listened to the original FFVII soundtrack since 1997 when I played the game\, I fell in love with the music. I was worried they might change too much and ruin the tracks\, but they added in orchestral remixes for the right tracks\, and hard electric remixes for the deserving tracks. Its so well down\, you'll have chills going up your spine on many fights. The voice work is also very well done\, Barrett specifically is one of the voice actors I didn't like in the demo\, but by the end of the game\, you've really felt the changes in his character and his attitude towards Cloud.Story: As I eluded to above\, the story has been updated. It has been given ADDITIONAL chapters\, but none have been removed. Some people find this bad\, others good\, its all personal preference. I enjoyed it because it allowed me to spend even more time in a city (Midgar) I always felt was mysterious and had a dark side that we don't get a great glimpse into. The big baddie\, Sephiroth\, is much more engaged with Cloud this time around\, revealing things to the payer that were not revealed until much later in the original. From my perspective\, the revealed content wouldnt\, and doesn't\, ruin the overall story telling or surprises that were in the original. The problem is the most vocal players are ones who already played the original and know what happened. This leads them to overreact and make assumptions about what the story is. I am playing this game with my daughter\, not telling her anything as we go along and watching her question the same things I did\, well much more. The big reveals have not dawned on her yet and I think that is a testament to the well done story telling.Overall\, the game is bigger\, better\, more beautiful\, more action packed\, and even more emotional than ever before. This is one you can not miss if you enjoy a gaming and story telling experience in one package.10/10 - A must buy!… Expand"

I was really looking forward to the remake as VII has a special place in my heart for the FF series\, but my expectations were not through the roof because I am older and know better. That said this game gets a 6 from me\, here's why.Pros:The combat is updated and while not what I personally wanted\, it's okay and manageable\, the fact the enemies are visible in the world is great to me.It looks fantastic\, I think it is the best looking game I own on my PS4 ProI like the upgrade the weapons feature\, that was a nice surprise and allowed me to switch up my weapons and go back to the Buster sword more then I would have normally.Mixed:Midgar looks awesome and feels huge\, but after a few minutes in each new section didn't feel all that large or necessary.New story beats are sort of interesting\, but again to me didn't really add that much to the over all story\, but rather felt more of a filler to justify having this part take place only in midgarEnding: Was different\, I didn't hate it like some did\, some of the new story beats are interesting\, and some of them aren't. This was just okay in my opinion.Cons:Summons are a waste of time\, at least the mechanics to me. There is no reason they wouldn't have just made them work like they did in the original. You equip the materia\, you can call them whenever you want in whichever battle you want\, and in order to call them more than once per battle you have to level up the materia just like the rest of the materia. And you should be able to equip more than 1. Having them as a \""character\"" was to me pointless\, especially with the semi randomness of which they will allow you to summon one.The long corridor effect\, in the original\, Midgar was pretty straight forward\, but it was only for about 4-6 hours if you did everything and then the game opened up. The way this was portrayed was the reason it was in Midgar only was to give us an opportunity to explore more of it\, baring a couple of areas that were a bit more fleshed out but for no other reason then to extend the game playing time started to feel boring and pointless.  I beat the game after 35 hours\, completed all the available side quests and really felt that I was in Midgar way to long.The game can be beat in about 30 hours\, I am sorry but when Square-Enix says a full game\, I was thinking something closer to a 50-60 hour experience for a JRPG. I have put more hours into a racing game then I did with this one. And yes I could go back and play through it in Hard mode\, but why would you want to? The only reason to do so is for the trophies.Some of the fun parts in the Wall Market are replaced or taken out completely for significantly less fun parts\, I don't want to go into details because of spoilers but it was less fun doing the first part of the Wall Market compared to the original.All in all this is a very long review for a game that i wanted to like more\, that makes me want to go back and play the original\, except for the fact that I find it hard to do now\, because I don't want random battles anymore\, but I want turn based combat\, or my original summons back in the way they should be\, I also want my Midgar and rest of the game to look like this one and be voiced like this one\, so I find myself having a difficult time wanting to play the original now that this exists. This fixes some issues with the original game no doubt in my mind about that\, but creates new ones that from a remake I didn't want nor was expecting. For that reason it's a 6 in my mind\, I might up it to a 7 depending on how long it takes to get part 2 and whether or not our character and materia progress carries over to the next part. But if it doesn't and this really is a stand alone game it will stay at a 6 or go to a 5.… Expand"

Ending up in disappointment for spending that hefty price on a game that doesn't meet your expectations.. Well.. Final Fantasy VII: Remake isn't one of those moments! It is\, by far\, THE best remake of a game I have ever played. They did everything right.  They kept it classic at some times\, at others they enhanced some of the details to make the experience much higher quality. Great balance between action and dialogs\, the pace of the game is good. Rich NPC personality\, makes you care about every single line they have to say. Combat system is\, in my opinion\, top notch\, a la FFXV style but more fluid. It can become hard sometimes if you're not prepared. Like wipe 2-3 times hard. The voice acting is top quality\, it even made me do some reseach on the voice actors. Wedge's voice sounded so familiar that I had to double check! (If you're a Breaking Bad fan you'll recognize that voice too!) The music is so immersive\, all the classic song remake are perfectly blended within the nostalgia. Made me put my life on pause for the entire gameplay session. Graphics are obviously taking the best out of the PS4 capabilities. Even on non-PS Pro version. From the very first second\, you already feel the attention to every single detail was put into play. I commend the artists who worked on that. Two negative points: Side quests feel like they are just there to  time gate the game (although they might only add 3-4 hours so far). They're not that engaging I think. That's something they could improve in the next game. Tutorials pop ups\, even though being a standard nowadays.. Are breaking the immersion. I wish they used  another way to tell players about gaming mechanics without having to pause your game to read some text.. In conclusion\, I am happy to finally feel like my 80$ was worth that much. Even more.I am so glad to see all the years of FF14 Online monthly subscription fees that I invested in SquareEnix finally paid off for some great game development!10/10 (it made me create an account just to write and post my review)Good work to the SquareEnix team who worked on FF7: Remake!… Expand"

Yes.Was i happy with what i got? No.This is an honest non biased review. I did enjoy the game but theres things about it that have knocked it down in score for me and i will explain below\, i will also say what i liked after.The length of the game is a big down factor for me\, this game is easily finishable in 25 hours with all main/side quests done on normal and no cutscene skips. This i'm not happy with purely because of the price tag on the game with the amount of content given\, my guide for games is £1 per 1 hour on my first playthrough and i never rush the first time (closer to the price tag it is with hours the happier i am). They didn't have enough content at all in this game for the price we paid\, i would have loved some endgame stuff like going back to previous people you've met and talking to them with your endgame party. I would have preferred just more story overall but any type of new content to make the playthrough last longer i would have been happy with. Platinum'ing a game isn't where the hours should be\, all main and side quests should at least be 45 hours of content on a game like this.This isn't anything big but it needs to be mentioned. This game needed more polishing\, there are really weird delays at times like when talking to a vendor/person it can take 5-10 seconds for the speech to even happen. There are delays elsewhere even in combat and just exploring that like i said can easily be looked past i just needed to mention it. This game wasn't polished quite enough its in alot of the smaller things that can just make a huge impact that they didn't look into and fix. I have an up to date PS4 Pro that never gets exsessive use\, so its not the console thats the problem. The AI need to be looked into too\, there's many times im forced to switch to another character purely to just spam square so they have ATB to be used\, Tifa wasn't bad she generally had at least one bar there for me to use when needed but everyone else would barely attack to even charge it. I'd be sitting there with 2 ATB before anyone even got half a bar. In a real time fighter\, not a turn based game this shouldn't really happen.I liked the fact they've added more story to characters previously you didn't really care for because you just didn't know them. I like that they've risked a realtime combat system for a game that was purely turn based and its worked just needs to be polished. I loved the change to the way Aerith gets her dress\, that person amused me quite abit. The characteristics of people really stand out\, cloud even while you can tell Zach's memories have taken over he seems to have more of a cloud personality.  I generally really enjoyed what i played its just i only got to play 25 hours.This is the game Sqaure Enix really cannot afford to mess up\, If these points are sorted in the next part they will end up with a near flawless game. The playtime however knocks it down quite alot. That has made me unhappy with the product\, there just wasn't enough. If this game was a 30-35 price tag i would have been happy.

75036,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,8,"I got the chills when this game began. As soon as I heard the start menu music\, I was dopamine blasted and it just kept getting better as the intro continued. I may have teared up.in terms of how the game looks\, I couldn't have asked for better. It encapsulates many of the actual visions many had for the '97 version\, I'm sure. For the first several hours\, I was just so amazed at 'what they've done with the place'. They got it right.  Weapons\, I loved that they showed them when you switched them out in FF797\, which was kind of a big deal back then. They are a true beauty to behold in the remake\, I spent some time just staring at the Buster Sword on Cloud's back.I enjoyed more depth in some old toss aside characters (Jessie\, Biggs\, Wedge mostly) and that they were better at making Monsters that LOOKED bad ass and tough actually those two things in practice. There were bulls eye personality upgrades. Characters like Don Corneo and Professor Hojo really dug in and said\, \""No. THIS is how creeped out these guys are supposed to make you feel.\"".There was a lot of conversation padding\, don't quote me verbatim here but at times it just felt like a big case of:\""What if I can't do it?\""\""I believe in you!\""\""I can't go on.\""\""You have to\, besides\, here's yet again another list of all the problems followed up by the list of pick me ups I've been serving you for the last 20 hours!\""Cloud \""You're right. Let me spit out these new things I have to say with my yet again newfound resolve!\""\"" C'mon\, Cloud. Let's go do that thing that you probably forgot you even had to do since we've been having this same discussion AGAIN for about 20 minutes or so.Barret: \"" Let's kick some Shinra behind! I need to be as offensively stereotypical as I can be\, FOR THE PLANET!!\""This is what happens when you make Midgar a game all on its own. Midgar is just so small compared to what the rest of this game world brings to the table. They think FF7R will fit in just three games if they keep this up? If they do everything like Midgar\, our generations kids won't ever see the end of this remake much less myself. This is only a scratch on the surface on what the whole story brings\, and it worries me that they will start cut corners on account now they're in too deep doing it like this. They did give me an employee Shinra Key card with it in a nice little tin case. I wondered if we all got the same employee number. Sadly they're all the same\, they missed an opportunity to make the fans happy there. Nice touch\, though.Boss battles\, in some cases\, pulled the\, 'You may have defeated this version of me but how about ANOTHER!!!' too much. It's as if they felt the game had to be a certain number of hours long\, which is fine\, but it's a shame when you've looked forward to a game for this long\, only to hear yourself thinking\, \""When is this part just going to be done already??\"". The final say......I dunno\, 5-10 hours were especially guilty of this. They made some pushover monsters from the past tougher. Sometimes it really worked\, and I loved it. At other times it felt planted just to keep that clock ticking. Things got a tad absurd considering these heroes have a litany of other things to go see and do beyond Midgar. Long cut scenes\, however\, are what you sign up for with FF7. I loved them then\, and I love them now.UGH\, some of the corridors and forced camera angles! The seizure inducing spinning! Unnecessarily slow walking! NPC's that take forever to respond to you (and until they do\, you're stuck buddy get comfortable.)!Side quests could have been more fun. I don't want to have to simply attack a certain way X times before I can get a Summon. I want to FIND things. If I'm going the wrong way\, I'LL FIGURE IT OUT. There are markers on the map! Getting lost in FF97 was part of the fun! Here we have lots of invisible force fields\, and\, \""No Cloud\, THIS way!\"".  Okay\, okay! Here Tifa\, just take the controller!I do love what they've done with Materia and upgrading weapons. Battles have more of a Star Ocean feel to them\, and that's fine with me despite preferring turn based. I like the summons\, but I'm not happy with the money side of things. Cactuar and Carbuncle are already available for cash if you only got the standard version. Money should only ever be for cosmetics.When this game is good\, it's perfect. when it's not\, I think back to how it didn't matter what they were making me do in FF97 as long as I could keep playing it. This game\, despite its flaws\, was a labor of love. That said\, um... do I get to keep all the stuff I got here next time?… Expand"

As a series fan\, I was looking forward to the prospect of a faithful modern-day FFVII remake\, the nostalgia factor of seeing one of the best casts in video game history trod a timeless path. The original game is a classic for a reason\, and any excuse to spend more time in this world is an excuse I will take. However\, I was also somewhat frustrated that this multi-part remake by Square Enix's division 1 team likely meant we wouldn't be getting a new original mainline Final Fantasy for some time. Without spoiling too much\, they've managed to successfully open the door for this ongoing project to become something more than just a remake\, and instead become a brand new take on a familiar story.This in and of itself wouldn't normally excite me\, except that the game here on offer is brilliantly realized in how it adapts events from the original game with excellent presentation and storytelling. The characters are alive and vibrant\, and despite the talk above about what the game changes\, it keeps the core elements of their personalities and world views untouched. The additions are embellishments that support the strong characterization of the original\, and almost all of the additions land. The character relationships are better than ever. Cloud's complex psyche can be seen in things as subtle as eye movement and body language. Wall Market has never felt so lively and debaucherous\, and Seventh Heaven has never felt more like home.The combat is excellent as well. I would've been more than happy with turn based\, but this is a fine action RPG system that leans very heavily on the RPG side of the equation. Combat is tactical\, and strategic use of your characters' different abilities is key to boss fights and even many regular fights. The game is visually gorgeous most of the time\, but there are some janky texture issues. It's unclear if it's lack of polish or a technical issue preventing them from loading in\, but it's very noticeable in certain sections. The music is a standout\, choosing to feature a extremely varied blend of a lot of tracks from the original remixed and reordered. The new tracks are largely ambient\, though there are a few new memorable melodies scattered throughout. I'm a particular fan of the somehow even moodier interpretation of \""Anxious Heart\,\"" my favorite from the original as well.I cannot wait for the second part of this project.… Expand"

75051,FFVIIR,2020-04-17,10,"This is one of the best games I've ever played in my life. The battle system is one of my favorites ever in a JRPG.  They designed it to kinda feel like a turn-based system once you understand the strategy of it. The depth of the world is absolutely breathtaking\, both in terms of visuals and characterization. It feels like the characters have come to life. At times\, it seems like Aerith is a real person--they did especially well with her. The voice acting is great all around. I was a bit worried about the voice acting after seeing the trailers\, but when you hear it all naturally in the game\, it doesn't have the stilted sound like it sometimes does in the trailers.How does it compare to the original? The original has two big things going for it--one\, our nostalgia; two\, it's the complete story. That said\, I stand by what I said--I think Remake is one of the best games I've ever played in my life.(Spoilers)Some people are upset by the ending\, and I just beat it about an hour ago\, so it's still relatively fresh on my mind....but I don't think there's anything to indicate they definitely beat \""Fate.\""  They beat the Whispers there at the end....but are those all the Whispers? Can the Whispers come back? We're not told\, so I think assuming they've beaten destiny is perhaps going a bit too far.Next\, even if they did beat destiny and we never see the Whispers ever again....is there any indication that the next game won't follow the story for the most part? I mean\, the whole thing is kinda commentary on the whole Remake process anyway. I think it's cool--if they do follow the story for the most part\, it's because the characters have their own free will\, and yet we know it's because the original story went that way....but the characters aren't bound by that destiny in their own world. I think that kind of back-and-forth play is very cool.And this is where I depart from many people--if tomorrow\, they announced that they're going to do a completely different story with these characters\, I'd be on board all the way. And I would be because of the excellent game they've created here. I want to see what this team does in the next installment and if they just go crazy with the plot\, I'll be on board with them as long as they keep the life that they breathed into this game.… Expand"

FF7 Remake does have great visuals and gameplay and would get a 10/10 if that was all that mattered. The original took patience to deal with the turn-based gameplay and polygon graphics (groundbreaking for 1997 no doubt). But it paid off with a deep storyline that took turns at every break point and invested your experience into the character development. That great spirit is why a remake was demanded 20 years later.Being an original fan I could look past the episodic release even though the 1st episode covers only 10% of the original. They did add depth to minor storylines that extend the playtime. The remake story followed pretty true until the final chapters of the game. The developers unfortunately pissed away a good deal of goodwill of their fans by forcing the main antagonist into the story way too soon\, destroying the mystique of this antagonist and setting the road to completely altering the story that was what made this game last the test of time.

My only gripe with this game is the lock on system \, the camera doesn’t center on the enemy when doing so\, instead they are off to the side and makes it feel awkward. Also the dodge mechanic could use work\, like maybe grant you 1/10 of a second of invincibility because I seem to always take damage when I dodge attacks no matter what. Also a parry mechanic would do wonders \, make it similar to Gladio’s parry would be perfection .

Players are very busy during the battle.  So\, it is rich in tactical nature\, if we speak favorably of it\, or it is extremely complex\, if we speak unfavorably of it.  Also\, the equipments must be replaced such as Materias frequently\, because the party members often join and leave.  I feel that deploying a system for this is necessary.  In addition\, the cap of growth factors such as level is low\, and the exhilarating feeling and decreasing difficulty for battles are small even after the clearing of the game.Finally\, the story is upgraded well from the original.  However\, new elements (ending\, fury\, a scene of the grave for trains\, i.e.) appeared in this time stand out from other elements as a bad meaning\, and I feel that those are not along the flow of the story and not suitable for the world view of FF7.  It is no exaggeration to say that this is the biggest and only problem of this work.Overall\, it's an entertaining game and a very good remake of FF7.

Like GoT became a prime example of this for TV\, FF7R will be looked at as a case study for it in the medium of video games.The Whispers (or Dementors or Sephi-ghosts) prove to be the biggest problem in the game; overshadowing graphical issues (like NPC demon mouths)\, over padding (sewers and train graveyard)\, and bipolar swings between classic Aeris and all-knowing-reality-bending-demigod Aerith. This coalesces into the Meta stand-in for fanboys that must be defeated so the game can stand alone\, divorced from it's predecessor. What actually results is a loss of any agency for our heroes as any and all struggles they face are simply preordained conclusions\, the most egregious being the Sector 7 plate drop. After said rabid fans are put down\, the game fast forwards to an unearned fight against Sephiroth that renders any further conflict with him devoid of stakes\, since we've already killed him.Had the game ended with the highway\, I would have given it an easy 8\, maybe even 9\, Whispers and all.

I tried to approach this game with and open mind but since it does have the name FF7 REMAKE\, i will compare it to the original as well.This game will take you about 40 to 60 hours to complete depending on if you go through all the sidequests. Off the bat I realize that combat is changed from turn based strategy to like a real time action system where you can pause and issue commands. If you've played FF15\, it's the exact same\, and almost feels as if it was pasted on to this game with FF7 skins. I wasn't really a big fan when they used that system with FF15 and this game didn't change my mind at all. The camera sometimes goes wacky and you can't see what's going on for about 5 secs. The lock on system is shotty at times and can be difficult to control. You will also at times miss attacks\, spells or even LIMIT BREAKS due to interrupting cinematics.The graphics for the most part look amazing. Midgar was recreated from the ground up with immense detail. The characters look great\, materia is seen in weapons and everything looks good in action. Unfortunately\, it feels as if the graphics are the only thing this game has to offer.FF7 Remake has a completely different vibe than the original\, that at times feels like a cheesy disney movie. The story is mostly the same with some questionable changes. These changes don't really add to the story because they don't really feel engaging. The changes just add more confusing elements to a story that already had them and it doesn't clear up anything.Gameplay is extremely linear and they hold your hand through most of it. The puzzles aren't thought provoking at all\, and just feels like a waste of time. The sound design was done well and i appreciated a lot the original remixes. The side quests in this game feel close to pointless\, mostly serve as filler and is only for getting extra items or materia etc.  Actually about 8 to 10 hours of this game feels like filler with weak dialogue and endless banter. It's understandable because Midgar took 10 hours to complete it the original\, but why not just use those resources to fully complete the game instead of drawing it out? Speaking of complete\, Red13 isn't even playable and is just an a AI controlled character towards the end of the game\, which is just disappointing.Overall I was left feeling duped once the game was over. Square Enix built of off the hype that was FF7 and released mediocrity. Knowing that there will be two more parts of this at the price of $70 a piece is disheartening and I can't recommend this version to anyone unless it's on sale for $20. It's apparent this game was made for a younger generation and not the original fans of it. This one falls into a long list of remakes that shouldn't even be bothered with.… Expand"

75123,FFVIIR,2020-07-27,6,"As someone who did not fully play the original\, I was expecting this to be a more faithful remake so I could experience the story in a package where the gameplay mechanics are more up my alley. But it's pretty disappointing that they decided to take it in a totally different direction\, and not even in a very clever way at all. Basically there's a swarm of ghosts that represent 'fate' and when they're defeated the story is no longer on any preordained course. It seems to me like the whole reason they went with this plot device is to make an excuse for changing the story. It's 4th wall breaking in a way that breaks immersion\, and at a point I stopped taking it seriously. I still think FF7 has a really cool underlying plot and setting\, I'm just not sure I like how they are manipulating the story and characters going forward. On the bright side it wins some points back for having decent writing and dialogue for the majority of the game.There were things I enjoyed\, the wide array of well designed and interesting boss battles being chief among the game's strengths for me. But there are definitely some weak areas too. While the graphics and artistry are quite top notch\, the level design is ridiculously simplistic\, most locations boiling down to a long hallway with tiny 10 second detours. After playing a lot of other similar games to this\, it feels like they didn't even try to make exploration interesting\, which is disappointing.The combat is good and can be really fun at times\, but can also devolve into a cluster**** other times since you are trying to manage 3 characters while enemies are flailing all over the place. The party system and the way you have to manage it during combat makes things feel less skill based and more just plain high maintenance. This kind of depth of party control works for a turn based game like the original\, but in all my 40 or so hours playing this remake I never felt like it quite clicked for an action RPG with aggressive enemies that don't give you room to breathe. It too often felt wrong. As I said before though\, during boss fights is when the gameplay is at it's best in terms of skill and strategy.Plus the materia and weapon system underneath it all is pretty meaty and actually matters. You're really shooting yourself in the foot if you don't try to build your party up in a way that the characters compliment each other. That aspect of party management was something I definitely liked. It's when in combat managing control over everybody's actions that I found to be a pain in the ass\, since the AIs controlling the characters you're not using are a bit brain dead and rely on you giving them commands to be even remotely useful.… Expand"

They managed to make the characters express so much through the animations\, I wanted to give them an Oscar for acting.- Voice acting. They chose very good professionals to do it. Cloud was soo good.- Inmersion. Midgar felt amazing just to walk and listen to NPCs\, it felt the city was very lived\, and I found myself looking around so many times just listening and enjoying the inmersion.Cons:- A couple low quality textures\, which honestly I did not mind at all. This game really pushed the technology. It is a pity\, but for PC I hope this will be changed.- Level design is indeed simple\, classic RPG\, nothing special. Which is not really a problem since the combat is so fun\, and everytime the characters talk is a blast.- Controversial Ending. Without giving spoilers\, the ending is different from the original FF7 and therefor means the next game will not be necessary exactly the same story as the rest of original FF7. This at first I did not like\, due to incertainty\, but after some thought\, I do not care so much\, I will trust them. Also\, not knowing what will happen is really starting to excite me!(This is the reason hardcore fans came here to give low score to this game\, which is by far not enough to lower it even a little\, since we are talking 1 hour out of 56 in my case)But as I said\, the good things are sooo good\, that it is impossible not to rate this game high.… Expand"

The original FF7 was released 23 years ago and RPGS have changed a lot so square took elements from all their most popular recent RPGS and put it in this game.  It works.  They also introduced a neat little story trick that allows them to tweak established lore.  I know some people are upset by it but it allows them to give the same story as before that everyone loved while also keeping players who know that story on their toes as their is a chance things will be different this time.  A lot of work went into the story as well.  The writing\, voice acting and direction of the games cinematic's are all top notch. Fighting is a mix of Kingdom Hearts big summons and limit breaks and FF15's quick jumping around hack and slash style and is very addictive and allows plenty of room for player skill improvement.Most of my gripes are minor and could be fixed with some DLC missions or updates but as of right now thet are:- The game is too short.- There are not very many side quests or optional bosses- One of the major characters aren't playable- Tifa's **** look ridiculous.  Everyone else looks normal and she looks like a cartoon.- My biggest problem is that recently Square focuses more on storytelling then game play and no place do their games suffer more then the world map.  Like the latest Kingdom Hearts 3 they did an amazing job with the set pieces to tell the story but it winds up being a lot of you start at point A and need to go to point B.  It didn't bother me to much here since we never make it to originals world map in this game but I really hope the next one has a more open world like FF15.Overall though it's a great game that finally delivered the start of a new FF7.

At that Point you either hate the game with a passion\, or you are curious were they will be going with this. I count myself to the 2nd group\, yet i will try not to have too high expectations.Gameplay:The gameplay has about 4 things1.Battle2.Walking\, Running and a bit of Platforming with Dialogue3.Cutscenes4.Minigames1. Not much to say\, i had fun with it. Though there are thing i hope they work on.Camera (like in most 3d games\, the Camera is your biggest enemie)\, Air Combat (flying monster were a pain without a ranged weapon)\, maybe better invincibility frames for the roll.2. Without interactions between characters\, this would be hard to bear\, good thing there are things that make the world feel more alive than the dreaded Tunnels of FF13. And to be fair\, the Original FF7 was at least as linear as FF7R.3. Square Enix can do cutscenes\, enough said.4. Wish there were more\, or you could do most of them without playing through a bunch of story first\, then again i had a blast with them.Presentation:Game looks gorgeous\, just a few places were you just see the limitations of consoles (sometimes the resolution of the background is fuzzy).I love game soundtracks\, a game with a bad soundtrack can be hard for me to enjoy\, no problems here though. This game alone has a big enough Soundtrack that you can fill 7 CDs with it.Some are arragenments or remixes of the original FF7 Soundtrack\, done by Masashi Hamauzu (hand picked by Uematsu) and Mitsuto Suzuki\, both of them know for their Music in the FF 13 Series.I really like the cinematic approach they are taking with the music\, also the transition from normal to battle. There are a bunch of new tracks\, maybe missing the Uematsu charme\, yet i could listen to some of them for hours.Normal price is okay for this game\, if your own pace is about average you will spend about 30 - 40 hours on your first playthrough and about 50 - 60 hours for the platin trophy.Things that made me lower the score:- Camera and air combat- not much exploration\, now that you have a map\, you see how linear the game really is- oh please tell Normua and Toriyama not to make the storyline more complicated… Expand"

At the end of the game you'll be left wanting more enemies and bosses to fight\, more of the story\, and more of the overall experience. People who gave this game a bad score is being unreasonable. The game does so many things better than all the other games: amazing characterization\, fantastic combat\, great lore and story.Now with the flaws (not major enough to really dock points) buy they are very evident cannot be ignored:- Marketing. Apparently many people thought this was a completed original FF7 game from head to toe. Although I knew this\, I can admit that it can be slightly misleading since there are not \""parts\"" or \""episodes\"" on the box. Rather\, it only says \""Remake\"" with small captions on the back of the box that explained the game being episodic. I don't personally find this worthy of docking a ton of points since I got over 60 hours out of this game so the value is worth it.- Bad and/or slow texture bugs on day 1 launch. It's something that is noticeable and does take away immersion a little. Game still plays fine and I haven't experience crashes or anything serious.- Aerial combat is a annoying. Luckily you don't fight too many aerial enemies but when you do the battle always feel extremely drawn out because you cannot get to the enemy and when you do the can only hit them a few times before falling. Aerial combat also potentiates the camera issue.- Camera issues. It's not horrible per se\, rather\, it's somewhat inconvenient? Even with the lock-on system I've used skilled in the opposite direction or miss a combo entirely just because of the way the camera is. You sort of have to constantly move it yourself. Many areas are too cramped or small and the camera is literally at your character's head and can barely see anything. Overall this can easily be fixed and i's more of an inconvenience than a deal-breaker.- Lastly is the pacing. Trust me\, you'll be able to tell which part is pure 100% filler or padding. Some parts feel inorganically drawn out and overly long or no reason.Overall these are all technical issues that can be fixed. The core of the game: the story\, combat\, graphics\, and characters are ALL fkin amazing. I'm on to getting Platinum while waiting for the next chapters.… Expand"

75168,FFVIIR,2020-05-03,8,"Amazing game that was 10/10 for me until the ending that brought it down quite a bit.Its still a fantastic experience\, i absolutely loved it but i dont like that newcomers feel like they have to play Crisis Core\, Dirge of Cerberus and watch Advent Children to understand that Nomura wants Sephiroth to be a time traveler because thats his idea that ruined Kingdom Hearts which assumed people needed to play the 3DS game called Dream Drop Distance along with bunch of story added via phone app *breathes*That being said\, excluding the ridiculous fate whispers and the minor problem yet new questionable additions like the japanese marketing booster Leslie and the \""funny\"" obnoxious soldier Roche\, FFVII Re-Imagined is ridiculously good. The music is good\, although i wish we could switch to a different more similar original music though. I loved the Coliseum\, even the sidequests because i loved having more to do\, spending time with my favorite characters and not just rushing through the short part of Midgar. So i loved many of the new \""filler additions\"" personally.The battle mode and graphics (excluding the background at times) is fantastic\, the cinematics (when no whispers are around) is 10/10 and depth of the characters is 12/10\, Aerith and Tifa are by far the coolest characters and i had to pinch myself a few times while playing\, i'm really playing this timeless classic re-imagined\, very similarily when i experienced as a 11 years old when it came out. The ending was the only boring part to me and i miss Sephiroth's depth\, main good guys got some great depth but he really seemed to lose his mysterious presence in the game\, where he killed President Shinra\, while dragging the bloody body of Jenova out of the Shinra HQ while the gang was imprisoned (Which didnt happen in this game\, minor bummer). We probably wont be astonished at him hanging the snake on a pole either. I just wish this was really a remake since the writers are expecting everyone to know Sephiroth so thats definetly less special for newcomers and to sum it up by time traveling and alternate timelines is just poor writing\, one Nomura excels at unfortunately.Also the fact that the game isnt allowed to be more brutal is kinda annoying\, you just dont see blood which is ridiculous.Original game was way more eery and dark\, which was kinda one of its main atmospheric strengths.I also sincerely hope (which is my main concern) that we wont see more time travel/alternate timelines like Nomura did in Kingdom Hearts\, i hope the Avalanche gang wont ALL survive and i really hope the heroic sacrifices that really made the story great\, will not be touched\, especially not through Cloud going through time to save certain someone. i sincerely hope FFVII will get to stay faithful to its roots while of course trying lots of new things that dont ruin the greatest moments. Making Zack and Aerith stay alive would probably be the worst decision they could ever make.My favorite moments were way too many\, i loved the Honey Bee inn\, Aerith smacking gangsters with chairs and Tifa being able to train in the gym as well. Sooo many fun details that were added\, the materia system is fantastic\, leveling up weapons was a good idea while not having too many of them. Also great that the game has New game plus and japanese voice acting. So if i wanna redo chapters i can have different language and play the game at my pace\, Hard mode is really well done and the gameplay value is alot. I feel like those that love the game can easily end up playing 150 hours in 2-3 playthroughs. Incredible ride overall and i really hope Nomura wont screw this up\, FFVII might become 4-5 parts even\, who knows.I dont mind it as long as there are no more Whispers and time travel. Thats my only concern and what brought my rating down to 8/10.… Expand"

Ya no solo por la fidelidad del casi 99% que me ha hecho revivir momentos únicos de una manera mucho más profunda y visualmente espectacular\, sino también por el controvertido final que para mí gusto es un acierto\, pues da pie a crear una historia distinta y no saber qué nos depara el futuro de la saga.A pesar de las opiniones en contra\, que son igual de válidas que el resto y las veo justificadas\, yo creo que han encontrado una manera sencilla pero muy válida para la continuación. Por mi parte me ha gustado la sorpresa final\, pues creo que sin este cambio esta parte habría quedado algo \""floja\"" e insulsa para mí gusto\, por muy fiel que fuese al juego original.Creo que llamar a esta primera parte remake ha sido muy acertado\, porque es básicamente lo que han hecho casi en su totalidad. Aunque personalmente me da bastante igual el nombre\, lo que me importa es el contenido\, y no se puede negar que es un juegazo en todos los sentidos y hace honor a su nombre.La única queja que puedo tener es que se me ha hecho muy corto para ser un Final Fantasy\, y que tiene poco contenido extra para rejugarlo\, más allá del modo difícil y sacar un par de detalles como pueden ser los vestidos. Y que se puede hacer algo lineal\, aunque eso es algo que en la parte de Midgar ya ocurría en el anterior.

75195,FFVIIR,2020-04-22,9,"It's been over 20 years since I played FF7 and although my memory of the whole story is fairly hazy\, the main thing I think of at the end of the remake is just how much of the journey there is left to play and yet I'm not able to and I've got no idea when the next of probably 2 or more installments will be made available. Could it be months or years? There's no doubt what an improvement there is in this offering. The graphics are amazing\, the battle engine is loads more fun this time around and the extension of storylines has made what was really the opening couple of acts in the original epic a solid 40 hour game that is probably one of the best this year.For me however\, there was always the feeling of being shortchanged whilst I marched on towards what was the end of disc 1 of 3 back in 1997. I know it's probably unfair to expect more from Square Enix considering the effort that has gone into this game\, after all\, if they expand the rest of the original to the lengths they have with these 19 chapters\, I'd probably still be playing up until christmas to reach the end. That doesn't stop me wishing I was swapping out disc 1 for 2 and continuing the adventure rather than writing this review though.There are other complaints too.... it's only small things but they start to grate\, Sometimes immediately. The voice acting for instance... for all the painstaking detail this game has been given\, the voice acting is often terrible\, Especially Barret who really got my back up from scene 1. It's just feels very B-Movie\, especially off the back of playing games like Death Stranding or The last of us (for instance) where the considered dialogue has been handed to A list professionals. I kept justifying it as being targeted at the younger audience but then you're reminded of it's PEGI 16 rating buy the often unnecessarily 'S#!T' blurted out in an effort to make it feel more grown up. Maybe that was the case in the original\, I don't really remember.Then\, there's the random comments your team makes\, it's like they're joining a conversation they didn't quite hear from across the room in an effort to feel included. It all just makes the script writing feel very dated. 2020 Graphics\, 1997 dialogue. Having said that\, I felt it got better throughout the game and by the end\, Barret was slightly less irritating (or maybe I had just gotten used to him) and in general the scripts seem to have been given more thought.  I'd known for ages that this release was only going to take you to the end of the Midgar part of the original so I shouldn't be too disheartened but if Square Enix think I'm going to shell out another £50 for the second of possibly 3\, 4 or whoknowshowmany sequels then\, well\, they're absolutely right\, actually....But I'm hoping that in the next few months a DLC will be made available for a reasonable price and off I go again in the adventure. Wishful thinking I reckon.So to sum up then... if you loved the original\, you're probably gonna love this too. The storyline goes deeper than I remember and there's loads of extra time to explore the various sectors of the Midgar undercity and play side quests.The battles have been brilliantly updated so you can now mix the turn based actions with all out button bashing (although mostly just the square one) The visuals are incredible but then again\, what did you expect? And the soundtrack is also a real win too. But\, for me\, it's all just too much of a tease to get full marks so 9 out of 10 it is.Please guys\, jusy give us the rest ASAP!And whilst you're at it\, get working on FF8 too (just don't think you need to add 'Remake' to the end of the title\, we know it's a bloody remake)… Expand"

Replay the game on hard\, pay -very- close attention to underlying themes and motives behind character behavior.  There are good reasons for all these choices and I would hardly sum it up to poor storytelling.  All I will say is this:  Sephiroth and Aerith have hindsight this time around\, aside from that everything in the transition from Midgar to Gaia is the same.  The game literally ends the same as FF7 with the characters embarking on their new quest and heading for the next village.  The extra bit they added\, is a sweet indulgence for old fans and I don’t believe it will severely impact pivotal events\, atmosphere\, or pacing in later games.  Again\, just do your hardmode replay and pay very careful attention to the behaviors of certain characters\, particularly Sephiroth and Aerith.

Seriously?? 8) they had to add pro-trans \""gender is anything you want it to be!!!\"" propaganda BS that\, of course\, wasn't in the original.Ugh.... anyways\, it's not bad. I just don't understand why they have to milk it and destroy the soul of the game. Oh wait\, I do. It's called money.And SquareEnix\, if you read this\, you BETTER not take out the overworld airship flying in the next one or you're going to have a lot of pissed fans. Please\, please don't get rid of the airship/overworld and make everything menus and linear BS like every FF since FFX.… Expand"

So much was done right from music\, to the NPCs\, to the weapon upgrade system;however\, so much was done wrong like camera angles\, battles\, and cutscenes. If you want to see more in-depth reasons for my rating see my Pro/Con below.Pros:Music: I LOVED the music in most sections. I usually turn video game music off to listen to a podcast or something and I haven't done that once with this game.NPCs: The sectors felt alive as I went through them. I liked to hear dialog about their lives as I walked past. Also\, the little side quests were a nice way to \""grind\"" without it feel like grinding.Weapon Upgrades: Really nice to customize the characters to support a play style I liked.Cons:Camera Angles: Why were the angles so bad? Why? Half the time I couldn't see where I was fighting or was phasing through other characters during scenes.Freedom of Movement: Yes\, FFVII was a linear game and I expect some of that to return but in a way this was worse than the original. We have the technology now to make it so slow walking through a sector isn't the only way to get to an endpoint. Clearly they can climb\, jump\, etc. so why not allow that a la Assassins Creed?Battles: Warning rant/screed ahead. tl;dr: Battles make no sense.Hitting an enemy who is resistant to physical attack just so I can get enough ATB to use the magic I should be using is annoying. Special abilities I get\, but things like magic and items should be available for use anytime. When I am fighting and trying to move away from an enemy who is about to attack\, half the time I end up bumping into one of the other party members.Faces: For the most part the female faces were okay. Not always great but okay. Male faces were always too soft and rounded. They felt out of place when looking at someone like Jesse. It feels like two different art styles got tossed together and whoever did Jesse is the superior artist.… Expand"

Who is in charge of this? I am astounded and completely saddened that this was allowed to happen...the only evidence we should have of Sephiroth even being alive by this time is the assassination of the president of Shinra (which we should not see for ourselves...Sephiroth’s existence should still be a rumor here) ... I can’t wait to see how you make up for this in the later versions ... bringing back anticipation is very difficult once you’ve already let the cat out of the bag...now that I’ve gone back and replayed it...I believe you spent more time giving Tifa and Scarlett giant **** and Sephiroth DSL than you spent working on the story and respecting the original game..tsk tsk Square...tsk tsk...- Cloud cannot see the future...the climax of the game is his self-realization that he is not the puppet that Hojo and Sephiroth make him out to be...why are you purposely foreshadowing the most anticipated scenes of the story unnecessarily? This does not benefit the die-hards nor the newcomers...these are pointless indiscretions and I don’t like them at all...add to that the inclusion of Meteor this early in the game...your main demographic knows the story...don’t give it away prematurely without reason...seriously...and this continues throughout this first cut until the end-game ... when Tifa somehow can now see the future as well...you didn’t give it away with the original...who the (bleep) thought it was a good idea to ruin some of the greatest moments of the game this early?- What is the deal with changing difficulties and chapters? What sticks and what doesn’t? That is the most frustrating part of the game...pick a stance and stick with it...there is no continuity once the game has been completed...what “game progress” am I working on? Some (bleep) sticks\, most everything else does not. Big waste of time for gamers. If I go back and obtain Bahamut\, for example\, it doesn’t show up in my “hard” game mode...but which game mode would it go to if we as gamers can freely jump from chapter to chapter? Where is the continuity? Love the idea of Chapter select but you did not think about everything that goes with that concept.- The remake of Final Fantasy VII is the most anticipated remake of all time...do you want to approach this opportunity with so many flaws or do you want this to go down as the greatest game of all time?… Expand"

The music is outstanding and the dialogue is (in most times) entertaining and fun.Overall\, the game is entertaining and it's great to see the characters who we loved to show again in today's technology. What made FF7 great is the rich story and characters. Unfortunately\, the \""remake\"" did not live up to the same level.The remake could have stuck to the original story and be one of the greatest modern hits\, but they decided to manipulate the story to be 100+ hours longer in order to create several installments. The story was dumbed down the dark and nihilistic side. The characters are too cheerful considering how their situations are.The people in the slums look too \""clean\"" as they are your usual Starbucks customers rather than what supposed to be laborers who are suffering from bad living conditions living under a huge metal plate covering the sky and inside huts with no lights and rats running everywhere.Some parts of the cutscenes and dialogs are cringy\, like Berret's overreacting over how he cares about Marlene and the anime-like behavior of the girls namely Aerith\, Jessie and even Tifa.The side quests are **** What made FF7 stands above all the other RPGs is putting the player into the action rather than wasting time on fetch quests and \""bring me my cats\"" **** to fill up playtime. None of the sidequests were interesting. They could have invested richer dialouges and side stories to add more interesting characters but they dropped the ball hard time.There are a lot of levels with 1-2 hours of corridors and one-way routes that are too long they become boring and you just want to finish them ASAP to move on.The new characters are all cringy and annoying you wish you can hit them hard in the face\, especially Johnny who isn't annoying in a funny way.Finally\, the \""ghost\"" thing was a very bad diversion from the original story. As I said before\, because the original story is grim and dark\, they want to fix it (it's not broken in the first place) by changing the story to a fairytale. I won't proceed more so my review don't spoil it\, but the story is going to be a Disney-like franchise where people are happy thereafter.The game is ranked as \""T\"" for teens\, a game which 80% of its fans are now in their mid 30s and older.The game took too long to be released\, and not even the full game too. You can see they used most of FFXV and KH's engine and mechanics so it looks like the game wasn't in production until far later when they reused the existing stack\, which is not necessarily a bad thing.… Expand"

75230,FFVIIR,2020-11-12,10,THIS is how you remake a game. I'm almost surprised they did so well with it. Highly recommended.
75233,FFVIIR,2020-04-18,9,"This game gave me feels. As an player in 1997 of the original title on PS1\, this game was an amazing recreation of the PS1 as well as adding a lot of material to lesser characters like Jessie\, Wedge and Biggs. First of all let's start by talking about the graphics. They're absolutely beautiful. The models are beautiful and close-ups to characters faces are very detailed. The models don't look plasticky or one tone color skin. The backgrounds and colors are beautiful. Look\, for example\, at Aerith's house. It's amazing to see.The music.If you played the original\, you'll love the fact almost all the music is here rearranged. You would think that would be a bad thing\, but the music just plays amazingly and beautifully. Gameplay.The gameplay is not turn based. Sorta. It has a mix of the active time battle system and the battle system of Crisis Core FFVII for the PSP. The difficulty selected during gameplay will determine how the battle scenes will play out. Replayability.If you are a trophy hunter\, you will need to play this game multiple times to unlock the Platinum Trophy. To obtain all the dresses you will play this game more than one time and there is also a trophy to beat the game on hard difficulty\, which unlocks after beating the game once. Veredict.This game is nostalgia for anyone who played the original and Crisis Core before it. My only complaint is that the game only covers the Midgar portion of the story\, but the amount of extra content placed in the story makes up for it. The game is around 35 hours of length for the first playthrough.… Expand"

75238,FFVIIR,2020-04-20,9,"Critical this game gets a 9/10 for me\, personally it is one if the best games I have ever played and definitley one of the best Final Fantasy titles\, personally the best since X (and I rate X very highly).90% of this game are a beautiful recreation of the original Midgar part. Every aspect here is build with so much love and respect that it felt like they build this world directly out of my memories. Start of chapter 2\, entering the slums\, looking at the upper plates skybox and seeing all this people talk made me tear up\, because it was exactly \""my\"" Midgar.The other 10%\, the ending\, is where things show you that this is not just a Remake\, but almost a Sequel. The ending itself is genius and the next game will show if this is a good or a bad thing.Characterization in this game is the strongest part of the game. Every character feels perfect and they have so much more character traits then in the original\, best FF character design in ages. All additional characters feel like a great addition\, especially Roche to show how crazy SOLDIERs actually are.The world itself looks stunning\, Midgar looks perfect\, Wall Market is exactly what it should be. The size of the Shinra HQ is impressive as it really shows the power of this company. Overall the world feels so alive due to the many NPCs with unique voice acting.The voice acting itself is also great\, I loved every one of them\, especially if you consider that some of these VAs had no experience before (e.g. Aerith). Barret and Red VAs are perfect and just capture the characters personality very well. The only one I was not sure about was Sephiroths VA - but after almost 100 hours I also really enjoy his voice. It is the same tone\, all the time\, with no emotions\, which makes the character itself even scarier.The gameplay is the best gameplay a Final Fantasy ever had. It perfectly combines action based combat with tactical components. Its like they took the best parts of every FF and put them into this. Stagger mechanics feel nice and rewarding\, the character movement delivers much more tension\, the weapon system gives great choices of how you build your characters and especially the fact that every weapon is viable and they do not replace each other. If you want to play the game only with the Buster Sword\, you could do that. And at the same time every character can fullfill every role because of the different weapons. Overall this fighting system feels awesome and so rewarding. Bossfights are 100% action from start to finish\, just feels great.The soundtrack is on the one hand very faithful to the original and in these cases perfect. There are also new tracks and remixes which are great. Only song that does not fit at all and did miss the situation was the song at the Honey Bee Inn when Andrea starts his show. Otherwise the soundtrack is easily a 10/10.But there are also some negative points regarding the game:First there is a issue with textures not loading. In many places the textures just show the basic ones\, sometimes the real ones are loading after some seconds\, some are not loading at all\, which leads to some janky looking areas.The level design itself is average\, almost bad. Many spaces are linear - which is ok because the original Midgar part is very linear aswell - but those parts also dont look too good. For example: Leaving the Reactor in Chapter 7 leads to through the reactor\, but its just the same hallway\, 4-5 times with a control room in between. Same for other areas like the sewers. So: Midgar itself and the world is great\, level design very average.There are some CG rendered scenes in the game and the characters do look very strange there\, almost too smooth and not really appealing. The in game models look way better here.Regarding the story: The \""plot ghosts\"" itself are way too obvious. Would be great to just have Cloud these visions as a story telling option\, but the ghosts are too much into your face to show you what they are supposed to be. Otherwise I loved the thing they were leading to.Overall I enjoyed every second of my playthrough\, I love the ending and cannot wait what they will do from here on now. The next part will definitly the one to be judged regarding story. The fundation was set here - lets see what they will do with it\, but I am with a positive mindset for the next title.… Expand"

Just seeing them presented like this in a game with such high visual fidelity is enough for me. They nailed every single character.Right now\, all I can say is that the only thing I'm not too fond of are key story changes like that one \""promise\"" scene just for a quick example. I felt now in this game it was just so out of place while in the original it was executed perfectly and was shown at the perfect time in the story. So just things like that...and yeah\, the story is important to me when it comes to FF games but the bottomline is....I cannot deny the fact at how much fun I am having playing this game. No matter what\, I prefer it to games like The Witcher 3 and Skyrim - those just aren't my thing.So yeah\, this game truly delivers from a character development standpoint\, visual standpoint\, sound\, art design and especially the gameplay and how well executed I thought it all was.

There's no denying the care that went into this project and I can appreciate that for all its worth.And the most important thing? When I'm not playing it all I do is think about just getting back into that world. Because honestly\, it's probably the most spectacular world ever created in a game for me. And to me that speaks volumes. Midgar is truly a living\, breathing city now and that alone gives this game an ultimate pass.… Expand"

I'm a new player to this game\, I have not played the original\, and the only Final Fantasy game I've completed 110% is FFX and I loved that game because it was turn based and not a mash buttons marathon. Which leads me into this by saying I had the oppertunity to play on classic mode which was really nice for me to get into the game. It's not exactly the same as turn-based where you can go get a beer\, mid combat. No\, here you get to promt in abilities by spending the ATB bars. I did this a while\, then I switched to normal mode at chapter 4 because the game inspired me to play it more \""Immersive\"". And I loved that too. Right now I'm playing on hard to try and get my platinum.The graphics of this game is uncanny. It's downright beautifull\, even though sometimes structures and ground clutter wouldn't render in completely\, but that might be because my PS4 is from 2014. Characters are believable and feels real for the fantasy world\, pun intended. However\, throughout the game I didn't get to know the characters as well as I wanted to\, but there is a reason for that after all.FF7 Remake is very linear\, but still it feels massive and lived-in. There are a few side characters I felt wasn't needed and a little bit annoying\, but the main characters are the show\, and everything I grew to care about\, as it should be.The progression system was amazing\, and really interesting to experiment and learn about. How you level up characters\, materia and weapons are progression done right in an RPG in this game. You can level up your weapons however you want\, and it feels like there is no \""right\"" way to do it. Of course there are combinations and setups that are better than others. But it doesn't feel like the game punishes you for how you decide to build your character or \""loadout\"" with materia and weapons.I think a 9 is fair for me to give this game because all the negatives I have to say about this game are basically nitpicks. And as a trophy hunter I thought it was a little stupid that I couldn't play on hard right off the bat. But then again this game has a lot of replayability to me\, and I can't wait to finish up what I'm missing in chapter select.Also as someone who hasn't played the original game I can't judge the reamagining of the classic either.With that said I can STRONGY recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played the original\, and even those that hasn't played a lot of FF games\, or JRPG's.

You have epic soundtracks for the battles\, super catchy soundtracks for some of the area\, etc. The theme song has beautiful melody and vocal which really suit the theme of the game.Really like the combat as well. It just feels very solid and it gives freedom to players on how they can engage with the enemies. It has an almost perfect mix of tactical and growth elements you expect from an RPG and action as well as button-mashing elements you might expect from an action/ fighting game. There are so much potential to the combat and I feel if they want to\, they can make it much more better in the next game. Aerial combat is problematic and needs to be improved though.The story is pretty good and intriguing to say at the least. There are so many buildup I hope will be paid off in the next installments.

Also this game seems to forget what it was meant to be... a remake of a classic but near the end it felt like a kingdom hearts game totally influenced by Disney tropes. On a technical level it lacks polish which is the reason it should get low reviews since this is a triple A game. 1: textures pop in and out all the time. 2: the sound mix is poorly managed\, sometimes I couldn’t hear the dialogue because of the music. 3: the music has wayyyyy too much variation. In the second near final boss (yes the random kingdom hearts boss) the music was literally taken from a Disney movie. The director of Ff7 needs to get this kingdom hearts BS out of his system. 4: the interactions with NCPs is very choppy\, sometimes you’ll spend seconds after clicking on someone for the dialogue to start.I could probably add more to this list. But this game definitely does not deserve appraisal on a technical aspect. I would have rather waited an extra year for them to release a triple A game. I was dumbfounded by the end\, but I rolled with the punches. It makes me wonder how much stuff they put into this remake to satisfy themselves as creators\, which seemed at times very self indulgent. They should hire someone that helps maintain coherence with the actual story at hand. There are some random moments that are more wtf and are not necessary to tell the big story they want to tell. The original is more grounded to a reality and has different rules in story telling. But honestly I’m hoping they stay away from anything that reminds people of Kingdom Hearts or Disney.  if they want to take a risk and piss off the fan base then they should at least make sure the game is fully polished. Only reason I gave it an 8 is because the gameplay is awesome\, and I’m hoping they keep the same battle gameplay for the second part and expand on the materia. I mentioned all the stuff I didn’t like but there’s also a lot they did right. But who cares about what they did right. Square Enix needs to read the feedback to make sure they don’t go completely off the rails if they want this 3 part series to succeed. This could very much be a deciding factor in the way their  reputation is formed in the future.… Expand"

75315,FFVIIR,2020-04-23,9,"The game is just shy of masterpiece\, but it's early version still so it will definitely be polished through patches to perfection. The game is scored wonderfully\, all being delicately remastered from the original soundtrack. The enemy designs have also been suitably polished\, all being just as creepy\, intimidating\, or adorable as they should be.  The game has been reworked to expand the original world to be tenfold the size as it would be\, areas like the Sector 5 rooftops\, which used to be three backgrounds and two minutes long\, being expanded to an hour of traversal\, combat\, and dialogue. The action RPG battle style of XV and Kingdom Hearts has been brought to the game for a newer audience\, seeing how turn-based has become a relic of the past outside of indie games. The ATB system having control over items\, spells\, and abilities can get a bit tense\, especially when in high level encounters. But a bit of tension and challenge never hurt anyone (except your characters.) The only thing I have to say against this game is that some of the texture work needs fixing (the early version need for polish at the beginning.) In Final Fantasy XV\, plates of food would show half-loaded textures for a few seconds\, before switching to an HD rendering of your meal. Many environmental items look like those half-loaded textures. I do\, though\, have faith that these will be given a rework in a patch soon enough. Finally\, and spoilers here\, just play the beginning of Chapter 13. The plate has been dropped on Sector 7\, and you find Barrett\, looking Biggs\, Wedge\, Jessie\, and Marlene. In this scene in the original\, I hardly showed any emotion. It was a unfeeling text box talking about characters I didn't care about. But now\, you care about Biggs\, Wedge\, and Jessie. They feel like characters now. Barrett is in tears\, his voice broken\, his spirit with it. The biggest\, strongest\, toughest looking guy on the team\, is in tears for your friends\, his friends\, and his daughter.  I cried.

75317,FFVIIR,2020-04-16,9,"FF7 was the first JRPG that I had played before Harvest Moon and etc. in 1990s. I have to say that I have alot of expectations to this remake version as I spent 100hrs in playing the original and replayed it over and over again. However\, with new technology and graphics\, this remake blew me away and made me fell in love with FF7 all over again. The transition between animation and action is so fluid and it doesn't feels boring at all.The relationship of the characters are so fresh; NPC and non-NPC. The expended stories and side quests that kept me interested and engaged. I remember when Aerith died back in FF7\, it was a sad Chapter for Cloud and you could feel the loss. I could bet that the upcoming FF7 remake episodes will make more of an impact in it once she's gone. The roadmap is quite linear and not an open world concept like FF15. The ATB and upgrade battle systems is a joy. Now summons can even join you in fights once you call them out and use some of their powers to aid you. I had spent about 20 hrs in this game and near ending of Chapter 8. Just taking my time to enjoy this game and its world which I had missed as a gamer.Overall\, I give this remake a 9/10. First of all\, the battles are either too easy or hard depending on what character you are using and the enemies that you are facing. I would like to go for hard difficulty but currently there's none at the beginning to start or change ingame. Second would be the story episodes. In my initial expression of the game\, I was excited that its going to be FF7 Remake as a whole game like the original. But unfortunately\, it is just in Midgard episode nothing more. That disappointed me a little than I expected. Another is the playable characters. It is only few\, and doesn't have Vincent which I fully favoured alot in the original game. Lastly\, I like to spent hours playing JRPGs and somehow its going to be lesser than that. Other than that\, I recommend for both fans and newcomers to get this game and experience a new FF7 remake story.Hopefully there are updates for this current remake in the future for additional side quests and events. I look forward to it and the next episode. Let it be soon!… Expand"

If we add to all the above that it is a game that in its original version came complete in several CDs and in this case is sold as several episodes that are worth the same as a complete game each we can reach the conclusion that the idea is to get the maximum benefit at the expense of mistreating a classic title in an unnecessary way.I don't recommend its purchase since the original game is a much better way to live the FF IIV experience and in case you are not looking for that experience but for a game of this style I think there are similar options in the market that for the price of a single episode of this title include the complete game.… Expand"

Graphically the party models look great\, as some of the cutscenes\, but the npc and some of the environment take a massive dive in quality to PS2 levels. Could be a bug.The real problem comes with the plot itself: the events are there\, but a certain bad guy is everywhere\, and not only he's aware of the events of FFVII 97\, so are certain creatures that make sure nobody messes with the events of the original game.These creatures will inject themselves in a lot of story events and ruin them\, you will understand as you play.Also\, it's heavily implied this is a Sequel that's taking place in a reality where the original game already happened.The final arc is probably the biggest mistake Square ever made: while it's not confirmed\, the battle and the events at the end are very\, very different from the original and make it obvious the rest of the remake is never going to happen as FFVII 1997 is now the scrapped past\, and they're going to do their own thing moving forward.As a game it's a 8.5.

75385,FFVIIR,2020-04-17,1,"Final Fantasy 7 is a game that carries a lot of meaning and importance to many people\, myself included. Having played it in 97 when it orginally came out\, I fell in love with the characters\, world\, and the epic story that the game told. Square had a recipe for success with this game as the original story was great as it was but they decided to alter the flavor drastically and made something sour and bitter.I can say the character world design is overall exceptional and its amazing to see characters and places you met and visited in your childhood in such vivid detail. Midgar feels like the Midgar you pictured in your mind while playing the original game. Combat is actually  fast and fun and requires thoughtful approach. The remake does a good job when it expands upon and adds much needed depth and backstory to better understand and relate to the characters that many people already love and adore. A great example of this is the games treatment of Aeriths adoptive mother\, description of Aeriths early life\, and the focus on Jessie\, Biggs\, and Wedge as friends who you grow to know and cherish\, friends you fear to lose.The remake largely is a faithful adaption of the original Midgar section of the game up until the finale when the game introduces metaphysical entities\, time travel\, alternate realities\, all of which never existed in the original game. These additions do absolutely nothing to enhance the story. The original game never needed such to tell a great story as greatness was already there\, this ending comes across like poor fanfiction. Square has stated over the past couple yrs how faithful to the original the remake would be\, its very disingenuous and misleading to call this game a remake and not reimagined with the poor story changes near the climax.… Expand"

Let's also leave aside the appearance of Zack so early on taking away from the major twist of the game\, and Barret's Cosmo canyon scene being emotionally lessened due to Biggs and maybe Jesse being alive. Let's leave aside the final fight with Sephiroth being all flash no substance as he hasn't earned his place to be there yet. Most newcomers will still have no idea who he even is so what is he doing as the final boss.Narrative is important\, the key themes and concepts of a story resonate with people. We recognise ourselves in the characters we see strengths weaknesses and are able to abstract lessons from them. These characters and their stories are as real to us as real people because of the effect they have had on us and our lives.

I'm gonna score it a 0 as a protest to all those 10s which this game definitely does NOT deserve!Let's just say for example Square left the story alone and Nomura didn't insert his extremely cringey dementors into key moments of the game and ruining it. Let's say they didn't add terrible cringey side characters like Roche and Chadley  who don't fit at all. And let's just say they didn't ruin the entire story and characters by constantly showing Sephiroth every hour of the game\, killing the subtlety of his approach in the original. Long gone is the mystery and intrigue. And lastly let's say they didn't completely **** up the end by changing everything. Letting Zack live and destroying the core of Clouds character. Ruining any build up to a fantastic journey to fight and defeat Sephiroth. Even if all of the games story stayed true and didn't piss off the loyal fans\, my point remains that the game itself is still weak!Even staying true to the original it's a 6-7/10 at best.Let's name a few things.-Repetitive combat. Mostly spamming square and healing on occasion.- Hallways everywhere! Flashbacks to forcing my way through FF13. ugh.-Cloud constantly moving slow in areas.- Cringey dialogue. (Jesse dying was painful to watch and not because it was emotionally painful but because she wouldn't just die already! had so much terrible dialogue to spew out) She's also thirsty as ****.-Side quests are terrible and repetitive. mindless padding. Something FF15 does alot of-Pacing is destroyed completely. The flow of the story is so off compared to the original. You're not as invested because of it. Ultimately the original was so much better.Such a shame.This game thanks to Nomura is gonna just go do its own thing and like anything he's involved in will just be a badly written mess and you'll all be wishing it had of just stuck to being a solid remake of the original.… Expand"

The lightning effects are on point! \, the acting itself (movement) is really well done and when it comes to combat\, you really can feel when you use Barret's gun-arm or Cloud's Sword and heck! Even Tifa's fists when you fight enemies. Loved the music in this game just as I did on the original.( This is the real un-paid review of this game )The game feels more like a movie than an actual game\, the fighting\, effects or music doesn't make this game any better than the original. I paid for a game and not a movie.Therefore I give Final Fantasy 7 Remake a weak 6 but close to 7 out of 10.(Input 6 to 4 because of the terrible choices to the story and VA's)It can be changed for some money ;)\, here I am Sony.… Expand"
75444,FFVIIR,2020-04-13,0,One of the most disappointing games I played in recent years. The game was supposed to expand over the original content but instead was padded out with boring side quests and narrow corridors. Thanks for nothing.
75445,FFVIIR,2020-04-12,0,"I created Metacritic account to reflect how badly Squarenix failed with this game.They ruined Sephiroth! The villain of the game that defined whole console generation.The villain that was originally introduced with mysticism\, inspiration\, fear and awe in the later parts of the game that tied the whole story arc together.The villain who showed that Shinra is not all powerful and that there is more to the planet than just mako.The villain that gave motivation to the main character to become who he is.The villain that we understand because he too is just an experiment.Sephiroth is now introduced in the very beginning of the game with no context - in fact just randomly as an flashback on some trashy Midgar alley because development time were so tight on budget. Probably because Nomura had ruined the story so many times with the external studios.Story is prolonged with game mechanics that are clumsy and reflect more other game titles that FF7.

Now that is a gross exaggeration\, but you will DEFINITELY notice it at some point\, and not in a good way. There are also some surface textures that are so bad you will think they haven't loaded in yet. They have. They are just that bad. But these are nitpicks\, hence the 9/10.Animation: 10/10. Does this even need explanation? Every animation in the game was rad. Even the silly ones.Story: 7/10. Of the elements I use to score games\, this element is the worst in FF7R. I never played the original so I am not sure how faithful this version is to the original\, but my God this story was a roller coaster in the worst way possible. It is really hard to explain my position without spoiling it\, but needless to say some things happen towards the end without some much needed foundation and explanation. It was bad enough that once I finished the game\, I immediately replayed the chapters leading up to the end to see if I had missed something or just did not understand what transpired. Nope. I got it. It is just not great storytelling. The conclusion lacks support and reaches its plateau too quickly. And it is really too bad\, because there are moments much earlier in the game that are the culmination of really great storytelling. The other reasons for this score are: (1) the ending wasn't... an ending. I can't really explain it without spoiling it\, but it just was not the completion of the story presented in the preceding 38 hrs; and (2) there is VERY REAL padding throughout the game that sometimes made me feel like I was grading a development student's first gaming project on pacing. I am not exaggerating when I say that cutting 5-10 hrs from this game would have made it better.Characters: 10/10. These characters are so well realized. I loved every one of them. And I knew I loved them because when they would leave the party\, I would miss them. And I would keep missing them until I saw them again. One of the reasons I am playing the hard replay-through is to see them again.Customization: 8/10. 5-ish second animation every single time you want to spend skill points on a weapon\, something you will do FREQUENTLY. This may seem like a small gripe to you\, but until you have actually played the game all the way through having to see that animation for every single character\, every single time you want to spend skill points on every single one of their weapons\, you can not speak to how annoying it becomes. It was actually bad enough towards the end that I no longer wanted to spend skill points when I got them. I would bulk save and wait until I felt like spending 10-20 minutes leveling things up.Gameplay: 10/10. In this game\, the gameplay for me is the combat\, and the combat is great. It is nothing like what I have ever been exposed to. The sort of quasi-pause combat. Really cool. One thing I will say though\, is that I wish the game was balanced with less pausing in mind. There are some fights that require a bit TOO much pausing to succeed. Still 10/10 though.Voice-acting quality: 10/10. This game has really good voice acting and it literally makes the characters. I mean MAKES them. You will know it when you hear it.Music: 10/10. The music was the first thing my friend mentioned to me\, and I can see why. The game has a really great set of music\, notwithstanding some of the game's songs that you can \""find\"" in the game world. Seriously great though - may buy the soundtrack.Price of game: 10/10. A pretty great game for $60.Extrinsic positive/negatives: +0/-1 I am going to just be blunt - the side quests in this game are not side quests. They are semi-required for reasons that I can not explain because of spoilers. But needless to say\, that I would not mind them being semi-required\, if they did not suck. But they do. They really do. And for a lot of really obvious reasons that are not worth sharing. If you are going to put side quests in a sequel (if there is a sequel!)\, please for the love of God make them better. The only reason this wasn't a -2 extrinsic is because of the VR battles. They are sick and I had fun with them. The rest of the side quests blow.Average score: 8.1/10. FF7R is a great game. I am not sure how faithful it is to the original\, as I have never played it\, but I did enjoy the remake. Having said that\, the end of the story in this game needed work. And if they intend to make a sequel\, that element better be nailed on the head\, because I really wanted to give this game a 9 or 10 out of 10. Some of the other elements in this game are Game of the Year material. They are enough to carry the game\, but not enough for me to recommend this game to people who play for really good storytelling.… Expand"

Unfortunately\, this one has mostly bland to downright poor qualities.Unlike the original game\, the remake has been artificially extended cinematically and gameplay wise\, mostly repeating the same points over and over in game. Some new story elements have been added\, but they don't appear to impact the game in a positive way at all\, and frankly; weigh the story down more than it should.Yes\, Midgar looks pretty\, sure. But the world feels empty\, just like in some of other Square's latest games. The NPCs have little to no purpose\, they don't feel like people and they do not contribute much to the world at all\, they are little more than rocks for the protagonist to either step on or around. Serious missed opportunities to expand the lore and mystique of the game more than just some fetch quests and extermination missions\, or being stuck with a bore-fest of walking around and listening to everyone talking about what to do\, instead of actually doing it.The voice acting\, at least in English\, is downright dreadful and cringe. Gone are the great VAs that made Advent Children a joy to watch and characters we enjoyed as kids in Kingdom Hearts. Instead\, we have contradicting characters that regularly make asses out of themselves repeatedly in the majority of scenes\, especially Barret and Jessie\, all complete with horrible voice acting.The combat is passable\, though more often than not it's just a series of button mashing\, though strategy itself doesn't really have much use in the game. It's mostly just half-baked\, and personally\, feels even more so than it did in FFXV.This game feels very unfinished\, and just a fragment of an original game that's being charged for $60 on top of preorders and other editions\, this needs to stop.I highly doubt Square thought this through when they announced the game -five- years ago\, and I doubt even more so that they have a detailed plan going forward\, but I will remain highly skeptical of the company that I was once enraptured by.… Expand"

75481,FFVIIR,2020-04-11,4,"Finished it yesterday.All i can say is play it to the end before giving rates.For me FFVII Remake was a mixed bag\, overlong dungeons which became very frustrating towards the end\, felt like artificial ways to just get longer running time for the game.Characters were great and made me smile continuously\, nostalgy was present many times but not as often i would have hoped.By the 26h mark i was getting bored. felt like nothing was happening in the game.When i got to shinra building my nostalgy were thrown out the window after i met hojo\, he was fine but the dungeon of hojo was just too long and boring and added nothing to the story.When i got to see what happened to president Shinra\, the changes we're just unnecessary and lacked punch compared to the mystery of sephiroth and the \""horror\"" part of the original.So then i got to the end and had to step into some kind of portal... I knew it would go off the rails.I never personally liked Advent children's Cloud who is more like a superhero than traumatized ex-soldier. So the end ruined all hopes of me liking the next installment of remake series of final fantasy VII. If i want to experience superhero-story i will watch marvel movies instead.In my opinion Final Fantasy VII Original wasn't like this at all.I despise Square Enix for turning this into bland and hollow superhero fantasy in spirit of dragonball z.… Expand"

And that’s not much. Every noble sacrifice is either completely stripped of meaning or just retconned entirely. Everything\, however integral to the original storyline\, is retconned. Every plot point is gutted to accommodate the unwanted changes. And the new retconned ending just outright veers into pure fanfiction territory in a way that only a paid shill could defend. There's a reason why most of the '10' reviews here are mispuctuated stock one-line phrases.This is an utter mockery of everything you liked about the original and I URGE you to watch it on youtube before you even consider buying it.

It's a pseudo sequel that assumes you already know the plot of the original.With that out of the way here are some faults that hopefully will convince you not to give Square-Enix your money for this subpar product:-Final Fantasy XIII levels of hallway design\, the game is extremely monotonous and linear\, it even goes as far as blocking you with a WRONG WAY message like it's a racing game.-\""We expanded Midgar into a whole game\"" actually means they added a ton of padding (it takes over an hour of walking simulator section just to get from the church to Aeris' house) and lazy sidequests (for example\, kill 10 types of this enemy); you don't actually get to explore other sections of Midgar that were not in the original game.-Graphics take a huge nosedive after the demo section of the game\, certain environments and textures look like something out of the Playstation 2 era\, this is not an exaggeration.-New characters/entities start showing up early (also right after the demo section\, conveniently enough) and often\, and they pretty much ruin every scene they appear in by depriving the original characters of their agency. Not much more can be said without getting into spoiler territory\, but it cannot be understated just how much these new entities clash with the atmosphere of the game and the story.-Action battle system doesn't actually offer any more depth\, every single enemy you encounter just happens to be an annoying damage sponge\, further contributing to the padding.-Despite all the padding\, it's just a 20-30 hour game unless you are really dragging your feet or get stuck somewhere somehow.-Already known for years but always worth repeating\, this \""remake\"" only covers around 10% of the original game\, but you still have to pay full price for it.-English voice acting is very mediocre for modern standards. Some characters\, a lot of NPCs in particular\, seem to just be monotonously reading the script while putting no actual effort.The music is good but thankfully you don't have to pay $60 to listen to it.… Expand"

Its actually a strong B+ however given how many glowing reviews there are I don't want Square enix to get the wrong impression and think they re-captured lightening in a bottle. Amazing game. Loved every second of it until the end. I know they want to give us a new experience but they really don't need to.

Just look at the facebook or reddit game threads\, it is what the fans actually want. The story is literally already perfect\, it can't be more perfect\, changing it can only make it worse and lead to fan rage/less sales.

I'm glad you kill the big whisper at the end because I never want to hear about fate\, crossroads\, or see another dementor again. Also other constructive feedback\, let a character stay dead\, it cheapens the stakes if everyone comes back. Finally stop with Zack. Cloud is the protagonist not Zack. Zack is like superman great but conceptionally boring. What makes Cloud a million times better is that there is nothing innately special about him. Hes just a kid with some mild altruistic traits who crushes on the girl next door and through a series of traumatic events and some Jenova cells/Mako later becomes the hero we all know and love. The fans love Cloud BECAUSE he is a flawed character\, let the protagonist be flawed. It's ok. His flaws give him the strength to be the hero.

A few examples of this are having the dementors from Harry Potter show up as a plot device and ruin moments that were so good in the original. Robbing players of Cloud and Aeris first encounters. Another is overly using Sephiroth.

Most of the side missions are optional\, so if you don't want to do them\, then... don't... no one is forcing you.All of the characters have stronger personalities and that makes the game so much more enriched in story. I'm looking forwared to the second part since that's when the real game actually starts. There's actual character development now.The battle system and materia mechanics are amazing. This is the playstyle I've been waiting for! I love it.On the negative: the game isn't polished enough to merit amazing reviews. It lacks attention to detail becacuse throuhgout the game there are textureless doors\, texture pop ins and outs\, and the sound mix forced me to raise the volume and then lower it. Also some of the music sounded like a disney movie near the end which is weird\,As the people giving low reviews.... I don't think they have actually played the game\, it's an amazing game. And yes the changes in the end are pretty amazing too! Just let it sink it after you finish it and if you know your FF7 lore this goes perfectly.… Expand"

There are two FF7 Remakes co-existing in this game. FF7 Remake is a straight up remake. It's great\, it's nearly perfect. FF7 ReMAKE is an attempt to one-up the original game with new story additions and additional content drawing heavily from the FF7 'Extended Universe'.

MMO-style fetch quests with no relevance to the plot\, turning screens that you originally ran through in 20 seconds into a 45-minute slog through scripted battles and boring\, tedious puzzles\, and introducing new original story content that is also entirely irrelevant to the plot and filled with the the exact same padding.

To remake the game with these kinds of productions values and expand on the characters and plot\, I mean\, it honestly couldn't all be done as one $60 game; it just couldn't be financially viable for them to not split it into more than one part. I truly do not believe that this is a cash grab\, in fact\, I think it's always a big risk to put this much money into a JRPG. That's why major competitors like Bandai Namco have their Tales still looking like PS3 games for their last two PS4 entries. To further prove my point: Square Enix actually included two discs with my standard edition: one for game data and one as a \""play\"" disc\, because unlike the vast majority of publishers\, they care about giving you the game playable on disc rather than just making you go online and download the whole thing. So no\, I don't believe it's a cash grab. I believe they spent a huge amount of time and money developing this game\, and that it's worth the price of a full game. What people are calling filler is the world building that I always craved in the original. I wanted to spend more time getting to know these people and locations. I usually don't like when RPGs are just an Inn\, an item shop\, and a weapon store\, followed by another dungeon... over and over again. Spending more time in the world makes me care more about what's going on. I know that FFVII is a revered game\, and many people think it's flawless\, but I don't think so.

When things are too hectic you can use it to gather your thoughts.Each character feels unique in combat too. Cloud is by far the most fun to play in my opinion however I feel the characters get better later in the game. For example Barret feels kinda dull at first but later in the game he can be so much fun and quite often has saved the day for my party. I prefer to use him as the ranged character with a gun but he does get some powerful melee weapons. I just used them at a certain time in the story while I learnt it's abilities then switched back once I had mastered it. However his smackdown skill is incredible when you are surrounded by enemies. His charge attack is great too. I'll let you all play about with each character and figure things out yourself\, but each weapon really does make a character play different and I love that.Story wise...just wow. I am so impressed. Few questionable changes especially the last chapter which I am keeping an open mind about. I kinda like it because if it was just the original story there wouldn't be as much excitement and mystery.

The combat system is much improved and enjoyable to play. That my favourite thing was the characters in this game are done perfectly. I find with jrpgs the dialogue normally is horrendous and takes you right out the game. But there's some genuine great voice acting and dialogue making you feel attached to the characters. In a strange way I feel a lot of throwbacks to Final Fantasy XIII game play. But in a good way. I'm still disappointed at that I think they could have fits all into one game without the pointless filler and extended corridors. With games as large as the Witcher can do it I'm sure this could have done. I've not been a fan of the recent Final Fantasy stuff. Kingdom Hearts III and Final Fantasy XV were mediocre games in my opinion but this is so much improvement let's hope we're not waiting years for the next parts.… Expand

He is followed back in time by ghosts that try to make sure everything happens as it should.So while the first few hours are a faithful 1:1 remake\, it very quickly changes to this new\, Kingdom Hearts tier storyline that has nothing to do with the originalSephiroths character has been assassinated by this new story. In the original\, he was a mysterious\, threatening entity. You rarely saw the guy\, you mostly just saw what he did. The impaled midgar zolom\, the massacre at Shinra HQ\, the nibelheim flashback. He was so intriguing as a villain because he was mysterious. In the new game every hour or so\, Sephiroth shows up and does some monologue that has nothing to do with the original story\, because as I said\, this isn't a remakeThe game then ends with an Advent Children tier cutscene in which Cloud and co are flying around\, slicing flying buildings in half\, having a one on one duel with Sephiroth in space\, fighting a giant flying time travelling monster.Um\, how are we supposed to go on to the rest of the game after that? The stakes have been set so high at the first part of this multi game series that the pacing is pretty much screwed up forever.Also the whole concept of the time ghosts is stupid.

If there's any reason to play this game\, this is it. Inspired between a mix of FF13s stagger system (but more simplistic) FF15s combat (technically more simplistic\, but flows better) and FF12's general \""feel\"".Some minor flaws though\, such as the camera is R3\, but changing lock-on targets is also R3. So if your target is behind you\, or out of sight\, the act of moving the camera to see them\, will lock-on to a different target\, and make your attacks miss.Most bosses don't have real mechanics. (Roughly 20-25% do though)And enemy variety is sparce. (This one isnt fully SE fault.)Combat Score: 9-NONCOMBAT GAMEPLAYI can't possibly stress this enough. The game is mostly padded filler. It's clear the developers couldn't possibly make enough of the game within the modern age of gaming. The \""new areas\"" are just road blocks/hallways\, to slow your progress through the game. It's very disingenuous for the \""new content\"" to be considered an \""expansion\"" upon the original. And with so many long road blocks and tedious treks\, the games pacing comes to a crawl. (IMO FF7's strongest feature is its pacing. As any singular factor of the original was never that great\, but the pacing made it amazing.)This alone would easily be scored a 1 out of 10. But\, to be fair\, there's still more than just pacing. Such as customization. Which is great\, and helps fill in the tedium of trekking through the games new hallway sections. Town exploration is mostly fine\, sadly no real new areas to explore\, since new areas are meant to be road blocks\, and not actual hubs/fields. Additionally the old mini games have mostly been ruined\, but some of the new mini games are pretty darn good.So combining it all together...GAMEPLAY SCORE: 5-STORYAlmost every character introduction involves a lot of poses. (Think Genyu force from DBZ) Followed by some of the cheeziest lines ever written. (Worse than the originals cheeze)The new segments are poorly timed\, or poorly built up. Such as hoping you would find certain moments scary/intimidating\, despite not actually explaining WHY the event should be seen as terrifying. But despite most of the new segments being bad\, there are at least a small handful of moments that improved upon the original a bit. (No spoilers here)Story segments from the original game had small parts cut out\, in awkward ways\, that don't make the scene flow properly.Lastly\, characters aren't really interacting with the situation\, location\, or other characters reasonably.ex: Barret Knows the name of a character that he previously didn't know\, despite no one telling him. Then suddenly knows what that character means to another character\, despite not being told. Followed by trying to harm the character\, despite the character not clearly being an enemy. And lastly\, states the characters goals\, despite not being told any of this. But YOU the player know this\, so they don't bother having the conversations flow correctly.STORY SCORE: 6-MUSIC/ART DIRECTIONThis isnt about graphics\, but how they chose to use artistic visuals to present the story\, along with the music. Both were improperly used. Such as happy music during sad moments. Colorful scenery\, when its an oppressive tone in the story.MUSIC/ART SCORE: 4FINAL SCORE 5.This game was clearly the limit of what they could make\, and tries to pretend its about \""expanding\"" the story of midgar\, when only 10% of it is expanded\, and barely at all. Most new content is designed to slow you down\, and not have any actual substance.What does Aertith think\, when she finds out about Cloud being in Avalanche? What does Cloud think about the bombings? These are questions we'd have loved to see explored\, but instead we get only a few lines regarding the implications of the bombings from a small portion of the cast\, with most dialogue being about fetch quests\, roadblocks\, and the trailers new \""ghost\"" looking beings.With no spoilers\, I can only say the ending is also rather dull\, and rushed. The final opponents have even less \""mechanics\"" than prior bosses. (They have none\, zero\, zilch) And contribute nothing to the plot\, while also being a complete change in tone of the rest of the game and story.The ending brings worries of all the things they can do wrong with the next games\, and unfortunately\, I can't warn what they are\, w/o spoilers.… Expand"

75749,FFVIIR,2020-04-13,3,"I am a huge Final Fantasy fan. I have played the original Final Fantasy VII and was completely open minded to whatever direction the new dev team wanted. I was so prepared and ready to give this game a 10/10. But as you can tell by my score\, I was let down. And this is all just my opinion\, if you enjoyed the game I am happy that you were able to\, I unfortunately was unable to. Also\, spoilers ahead so be warned!To start off\, I'll state what was good about the game. The character designs are amazing. I fell in love with the new updated looks. The game can be absolutely enjoyable. I would say that 30-40% of the game is nearly perfect. Anytime the game focused on the main beats of the story\, the game was a blast to play. Playing the Don Corneo beats\, going to Wall Market (experiencing Honey Bee)\, fighting Reno and Rude\, etc. All of it was wonderful. The combat can be rather enjoyable and challenging\, which is always good to have. They fleshed out the characters a lot more than the original and at points made them feel more relate-able than the original. Cloud and Tifa's relationship is more well-rounded\, Barret was toned down a little (could have been more well-rounded in my opinion)\, Tifa and Aerith's friendship is brought to light. Even Biggs\, Wedge and Jessie are more thought out.  But as I stated before that's roughly 30-40% of the game. The rest of it was absolutely a disappointment.There are so many issues that I have so I will do my best to cover all of my issues here:- The music is downright hard to hear. I have seen some comments on how the music doesn't compare and to be honest\, I agree. It is lackluster in comparison to the original.- Jessie is completely written as a desperate thirsty lady who cannot wait to get into Cloud’s pants. It is a shame that they drove her character from being attracted to Cloud to being downright almost begging him to have sex with her. If anything\, it made me hate her character and made me not care about her at all.- The textures in this game are horrendous. I do not know what the issue is. I cannot tell if they did not render the right textures into the game or if they have an issue of textures changing from long to short distance. For example\, Cloud’s apartment doors\, walls\, windows\, the bricks on the Leaf House\, etc. It reminds me of Sonic ’06 which makes me so sad that I have to compare it to that.- I have to remind myself that Materia is even a thing in this game as it feels like it was an after thought. It’s there for nostalgia and nothing else.- Sephiroth comes into this game way too early and for no real reason. He shows up all the time for no real purpose to the story. Sephiroth only shows up so early here simply to tease the fanboys and fangirls. It has no plot relevance at all.- The script. I was 100% prepared for there to be changes in the story and would have welcomed them as long as they made sense to the overarching theme\, plot\, characters\, and so on. If I am being honest\, my original time spent in Midgar was maybe 6 hours\, 10 hours at most if I am being generous. In my opinion\, the original Midgar script felt fleshed out. It was the inciting incident\, it banned the group together and got me prepared to fight Sephiroth and save the world. But that is just not the case here. It is completely dulled out and flushed out to a microscopic amount that it is extremely boring. The sense of urgency for example in many key moments is completely gone simply because we need to spend a full chapter and two boss fights in a train graveyard for no reason. As a player it was infuriating. The story is so hard to find through the mountain of quests\, dulled out chapters\, crazy long dungeons\, and way too many unnecessary boss fights. 50% of this story can be cut out and it would be for the better. It feels as if this was only fluffed out to hide the fact they did not have the open world map or mechanics figured out yet. And I can't even talk about the ridiculous additions near the end\, it was awful.- There are issues with the combat despite the fact I said they can be thrilling and fun at times. First off\, the camera does not follow your target if you are locked onto them which can be extremely frustrating. Secondly\, the ATB is infuriating at times. Charging abilities is totally alright\, in fact the Summon and Limit Breaks are done well in this game. But the fact that enemies have home-seeking abilities that hit you while you are using an ATB to use an item or spell and then knock you out of it taking your ATB with it\, is so frustrating. It makes the system feel as if it is based on luck. Aerith’s AI is wonky and does not do anything unless you control her\, at least in my experience.

While the first 2/3rds of the game made me feel like the good times\, before the empire\, the last third of the game is a blatant slap in the face to fans of the classic game.  I understand it's a remake\, and that you need to make it fresh\, but to change critical story points and add a half baked notion of fate/destiny to a world where that never existed is disgusting and disrespectful to the classic. This game takes away from the agency of the characters\, their trials their sacrifice in order to make something more Nomura like\, i.e. bringing Kairi back to life in KH3. Barrett is basically Kairi in this game\, he gets stabbed in the chest by Sephiroth\, then the fate ghosts bring him back to life\, yes their are actual FATE ghosts in the game. Not to mention that the fate ghosts look like giant mummified phallus. I'm sorry if you have to suffer through this game\, because if someone with half a brain had kept Nomura from writing this ending then it could have been a classic.Also the combat is amazing\, till you realized it doesn't evolve at all. Enemies use too much interrupting abilities to actually play the game without hitting r2 to pause. Also they turned it into an mmo where you have to manage aggro\, because guess what\, your allies' atb bar doesn't fill up on its own. So you will be spending most of combat slamming square to build it up. It's needlessly micro-managey. I hoped they would implement mechanics so that your teammates didn't stand around doing jack while you build your atb\, but nope. Basically they took a less refined version of ff12's combat and made it even more useless.   Add all up this isn't even a complete game and they have the nerve to charge a full price is the end.  The good will earned by 14 and 12 is done. I will not buy a single square enix game again\, even the western ips.  Thanks guys for being arrogant and disrespectful.… Expand"

Subtlety\, a drawn out but distant threat\, unclear motives\, seeing his power without actually seeing him. What do we get instead?

75737,FFVIIR,2020-04-10,10,Incredible remake faithful to the original with added scenes that make it even more perfect.The combat system is incredible and they have known how to adapt an action + rpg
75738,FFVIIR,2020-04-15,1,"The game was okay - normal albeit a bit boring up until the last portion where you climb the Shinra tower\, at which point it go straight downward until it reach borderline disgusting.I have a feeling the last several chapters was done rushed to meet deadlines because the quality of everything suddenly dropped significantly.1. Story got really messed up\, dialogues are cliché as heck\, probably the writer ran out of time and just insert whichever line first come to their head.Game is totally not for newcomer\, because unless you already played the original FF7\, you will have absolutely no idea who the white haired guy the party is ganging up against is\, and what he has done to deserve such treatment.2. A game freeze bug that most people get by just play normally. I lost 5 hours of gameplay because I was stuck permanently immediately after a grinding spot. The whole game is only 3X hours\, and poof\, 5 hours gone just like that.3. The gameplay is just badly designed.Because Enix likes action games\, they try to \""improve\"" the original ATB system into a \""more active turn based combat\"". What they got was a worse version of classic Hack'n'slash.- Most of the Materia in game are garbage\, just space-filler to make it looks like there's a lot of new and old Materia. You won't even have the interest to mix-match Materia in your equipment like the original\, because there's no real \""combo\"" to use.- As a new addition\, they give you a \""talent build\"" equivalent system\, which is named \""weapon upgrade\"".Sounds fun\, but in reality what it mean is you will spend most of the time choosing between \""+10 atk talent that cost 16 sp\"" versus \""+3 attack talent that cost 5 sp\"" in 6 different swords x 4 characters. And you will likely choose the latest weapon anyway\, except for Barret if you want to keep playing ranged (which is OP as heck)Probably the playtesters voiced that problem as well\, so they add an \""auto upgrade\"" feature\, which you will turn on for all of your weapons if you are smart.This weapon upgrade is prime example of a complex system with 0 depth.The design only get worse into the late game. I have this thought the entire game that with 4 PCs and a party of only 3 people\, how will they resolve the Materia/Equipment management issue at endgame? Turns out they don't. They ran out of time. They just add a square button DURING cutscene that you have to hold if you want to change equipment. If you forgot\, good luck fighting with naked Barret.The late game fights feel like they never went through 2nd design iteration. in the last several fight you basically have 5 seconds to smash buttons\, and then interrupted by another cutscene animation\, and repeat for half an hour.The game could have been decent. Fighting was boring\, but at least the story was good. But the last portion show so much disrespect for the player.SE obviously just want to get this cash-grab done with asap to fund other projects. When they said they delayed release to \""get a better game\""\, they probably didn't even have a running game by then. The delay was so they can compile the first version that could actually run.… Expand"

I especially appreciate how they’ve modified the weapon and materia systems.Even typically assumed weaker weapons can be useful now\, as it’s all a matter of play style\, and weapons you may have left to collect dust sometimes become useful again as your character levels up and all weapons receive new «weapon spheres» that sometimes add unique bonuses depending on the weapon it’s for. Good examples of this are one of Cloud’s later weapons and Tifa’s early weapon\, Iron Fist\, which has insane physical damage at any point in the game\, but at the expense of magic damage.Cloud’s late game weapon\, on the other hand\, has low physical damage\, but higher magic damage that somewhat allows him to overcome his general lack of magical proficiency - especially\, considering it comes with an attached ability that I won’t spoil. Feom what I recall\, the Materia system in the original game wasn’t this complex\, as it sometimes matters whether you place them in the weapon or armor slots\, and there are tons of combinations that allow for more strategy. Final Fantasy 7R is an excellent game that I didn’t accept imnediately. It doesn’t always quite capture the essence of the original game\, in my opinion - not to the extent that I would’ve desired from a more purist point of view anyway\, but it doesn’t seem like that was Nomura’s intention. It’s a re-imagination of the original game\, and for what it is\, they’ve done certain things well above expectations\, and other things not so well. It does have a fair share of minor flaws\, and I found the pacing a bit frustrating at times\, but it also surprised me how polished the game feels. It’s definitely an ambitious game\, and I’m really excited to find out what happens next\, because when FF7R doesn’t beat around the bush with it’s often slow pacing and mostly underwhelming side-quests\, it tells a story that becomes drastically more epic and immersive towards the last few hours of the experience.… Expand"

In your standard JRPG's pre-PSX\, you'd usually only have one or two side-quest chains because the game had limited space\, and thus the random battles RNG would hammer on you a lot more. In PSX and later JRPG's\, the ability to have a compelling storyline due to disc space not being a concern (other than pre-rendered cutscenes) moved away from hammering the player with random battles and instead added a lot more side-quests to them. It wasn't until the MMORPG's (XI and XIV) where the very-long sidequests-with-no-combat for nameless NPC's started being a major thing.Like the cat's sidequest was actually kinda cute\, but wow did it not drive any story. In another cutscene\, holy crap do those cats look a little too uncanny-valley.But I'm glad they put them in\, as optional material\, because something does need to break up the monotony of \""press x to win\"" combat. Which yeah\, I think this is a little bit guilty of. Action RPG is fine\, but one of the charming aspects of FF6/7/8/9/X was that the storyline wasn't pinned to grinding to get to the next part of the story. If you bought the latest gear\, or did all the optional sidequests\, you'd already have enough money or the gear already. Many JRPG's of the NES/SNES era required you to \""grind\"" a lot to get the money for upgrades\, or to make the next boss easy enough to win against\, owing due players not putting enough strategy into their party makeup/skills/items.

Anyway\, most new story ideas are downright goofy\, the battle system is cool at first but the gimmicky boss battles\, the constant focus on the stagger bar\, the back and forth switching of the characters and the bad lock-on mechanic make it tiresome pretty quickly.

75784,FFVIIR,2020-04-12,10,"Lets start from the beginning.The combat is amazing and really a crazy good mix between action and turn based. It also is challenging in some places and u get better at it over time.The music is the best you can find in a game out there. Seriously from town themes to boss themes it has everything u possibly want.The visuals are astounding and i dare say some of the best\, if not the best we have seen(excluding some minor pixelations and bugs found by some people\, myself included on rare occasions).Now to the story and characters. The characters are really well executed both on a voice-acting standpoint and a development standpoint and i found myself really caring for them.The ENDING which a lot of people hate because they dont understand is quite simple actually. They defeat the fate\,aka og plotline and that way they open up possibilities for new things in the next installments. We cant be sure if biggs is alive or if zack is alive because we have no clear context. I think zack is dead cause if he is alive we wouldnt have this story to begin with\, and also i think biggs is alive in an alternate timeline and is shown so we can understand the meaning of beating fate.All in all i think up until the fate boss fight the game is a clear 10/10. i personally like the ending so i give the overall game a 10/10 but i can see how this ending left some people wondering. But not the extreme so they give it like a 5 or below\, thats unaxeptable and totally biased. Also lets get this straight. A remake is the same core game done differently so they didnt \""false advertise\"". If they would call it Final Fantasy VII or Final Fantasy VII Remaster then i would agree. But they didnt. I myself never played the original but i have some knowledge on the characters and knew about zack etc. So as a new player knowing the basis of the originals plot line i was pleasantly surprised and cant see how someone would be mad at this masterpiece. 10/10… Expand"

The original story has been kept with some minor alterations up until the end. Some of these additions are good and add to the story where before there where gaps\, and some are disneyfied instantiations of an other wise gritty and dark story as originally conceived by Sakaguchi.Graphics and music are a masterpiece in their own rights. Gameplay is fun but can get a bit hack and slash at points\, but an improvement over FFXV without question. There are not enough monster killing sidequests except for the arena and the VR\, maybe a free DLC could fix this or events like they did in FFXV.The story is good\, unfortunately a bit diluted with some characters fates changing and making it more normie friendly. Basically deducting a sense of tragedy from the original game\, one of the core themes of the original.There are parts that have been elongated where it wasn't needed\, namely at the pillar where the sense of urgency of the task at hand is slowed by dialogue and cut scenes with overly chirpy characters.Overall a good game\, would be better if they deleted the last chapter and had the crew walk off into the sunset.… Expand"

Worst of all it is in no way faithful to the source material.I get that FF7 did not age well but  for all the high tech visual rebooting everything looks incredibly generic andOK\, Ive played it all day on advanced copy.  FF7 remake is not horrible but it is not great either. It is slightly better than average once you get past peoples fanboy squee-ing and the nostalgia wears off. Worst of all it is in no way faithful to the source material.I get that FF7 did not age well but  for all the high tech visual rebooting everything looks incredibly generic and bland . The char models look modern equivalent but the world models are ps2/early ps3 level simple. In some places more detail\, many are on a MUCH lower level. This is something that they can add more poly objects to make each area look more lively but for this  is WAY behind where it should be.It is much like XV and other AI party member games like KOTOR you will have other party members locked into \""roles\"" and you will only use/command them very sparingly for one or two specific techniques you need. You will rarely need to trigger another party members ability or spell and in most cases you can do that remotely.The combat is completely redone into FFXV interface. It does somewhat improve on that making things like spells/skills/items more usable but its still just spamming the attack button than any thing else. The specific fights involved are effectively nothing like their original counterparts. They are completely re imagined and are \"" X In Name Only.\""The old fights are completely different. It takes out strategic thinking and replaces it with twitch gameplay like taking say Civilization and dumbing it down to be Starcraft. I do not inherently dislike such a system\, but in a RPG and namely a JRPG where the game is about developing specific and unique characters it makes your secondary party members little more than an after thought once you have them programmed to behave like you want them to. It was the same in FFXII and every incarnation of having AI passive controlled party members in a real time battle system since.While the voice acting ruins the characters\,  The music is redone but for them being redone they are vastly inferior to the many covers that have come out with. They really messed the prelude up in this as well. Yet already \"" hip hop de chocobo\"" has been an infectious\, meme worthy surprise.They have taken the original script and treat it like it was just cliff notes for this. Adding all sorts of extra dialog and depth to characters like Jessie that otherwise did not have it. That sounds good but it does not play out very well with such an over the top anime presentation.More over they have clearly pandered to SJW logic in this. For example the deflating of Tifa. Now its hard to say how \""large\"" she was in the original FF7 but you can clearly see a pattern of shrinking her from other media including Advent children. Not that such things actually matter\, its the principal of it. The point is more that the ideology behind such a choice is also going to be adversely effecting certain plot elements that are seen by today's logic as dated and try to fix that. Problem there is that is like pulling a thread out of a sweater.Over the course of an 80 hour game(and how long they pad it out ) there are going to be hundreds if not thousands of little instances that each individual player will have interpreted differently from the source material and each other. Its going to face a lot of criticism because it is impossible for any developer to make a game true to what fans want because every fan can interpret the same instance in a multitude of different ways and we know that fans are HYPER critical when it comes to something they love not matching up with their perception of the source material. It might be OK if the game were all done as one package but between multiple episodes you are looking at a game that is going to cost 150-200$ MSRP and its DEFINITELY not worth it. It might get treated as GOTY but it will be received like Outer Worlds or RE2 remake.Good\, not that big of a deal after the initial novelty wears off.Its a decent product  with some serious\, glaring flaws that some will gloss over immediately because its FF7. Yet there is nothing here that warrants a day one purchase. Unless you never played the original\, you are better off waiting till the whole game has been remade and get the \""definitive\"" edition of it. You wont be missing out on any thing crucial. I would actually prefer to give it a 6.25 but 6 seems too low but 7 is WAY too high.… Expand"

This is a through and through reMAKE of Final Fantasy 7 and I've enjoyed the first 12 hours of it since it was released in my time zone to a great degree.Since it seems to almost be mandatory\, yes\, I too\, played the original Final Fantasy 7 when I was younger. I don't think it's fair to even compare the two unless you're talking about anything other than story as the core gameplay (active time battle) incorporates real-time fluid combat with a mix that you have control over to slow time to a crawl and choose your next move. The game even offers a 'classic' mode that of course isn't going to be the same as FF7\, but it pauses combat between moves so that you can strategically string them together more akin to the original.I have a strong feeling\, though I won't accuse anyone with a negative comment\, that they're angry because of the changes to the story and to a larger degree the ending. I feel like that's a totally warranted response\, but going back to my first paragraph\, this re*make* will likely continue to share the core story; however loosely that may be.I enjoy FF7 Remake *for what it is*\, and it does what it set out to do perfectly\, the narrative may not be quite what I was expecting\, but I also didn't expect it to be a 1:1 copy of the original either. What I love most about FF7 Remake is the way they've created this hybrid combat system of ARPGs and traditional turn-based RPGs into something I think we will see more often in other games or systems resembling it.Also I agree with many other reviewers in that there are some nagging details such as the texture streaming\, atypical map that can be hard to navigate in some areas in particular\, and a great OST that I would expect out of the majority of Square Enix created games.… Expand"

Sure it is one part of many and not the full game but what did you expect?. The graphical detail alone would mean a massive time to deliver just what we have. The extra parts and fleshed out sections work well enough and are all Final Fantasy. Just because it did not follow the original to the letter does not make it bad guys. If you wanted the original then go play it\, this is a re imagining of that classic not a copy.Sure there are some sections that drag a little but let us be fair here no Final Fantasy game has ever not struggled in some parts to keep it going.

FF7:R is a sequel to FF7\,advent children\, and Crisis Core. It's not necessarily a bad game;as a pseudo-action RPG it's pretty great. You might be wondering why I'm listing it as a \""psuedo\"" action RPG;well one thing this game stays faithful to is how the battle-system works;similar to the original RPG;FF7R treats the player as if they're going through a turn-based combat system(very similar to FF12\, or Crisis Core\, but not quite). You're able to freely move\, and utilize basic attacks\, or pick specials without cool-downs(not including limit breakers);however unlike an action RPG your evasion inputs really don't matter unless you're avoiding large AOEs\,constantly managing your party\, and switching characters to utilize the best method of taking out enemies\, or supporting fellow party members;as an action RPG it falls flat\,as a spin to classic RPGS though it does a great job with its battle-system. If you're open to a new story I'm sure the game diverging the plot won't be an issue\, but if you're expecting a 1:1 remake\, or a follow up to the original story via ep.2 you're not going to get it;I'm emphasizing this is a sequel\, because of Sephiroth\, and because of a returning character from Crisis Core;also because of ghosts that weren't in the original story that now are;if you don't know what I'm talking about;play the game\, or don't;maybe look up a walk-through.

For the 60 Euros price tag I just expected something more. The 40 hour length of the game is on itself not a problem\, as long as those 40 hours are packed with fun and engaging activities. Unfortunately 7s Remake provides here significantly less content than 15 did. Most minigames happen only once or twice in the story and even the sidequests are mostly fetch- or killquests with not much story to support them. Despite that Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a really good game with many improvements over the original. The biggest improvement in the Remake is in my opinion the battlesystem. After the boring press-circle-to-win tactic from Final Fantasy 15 it's great to have a battlesystem that combines a modern action combat system with parts of the classic Final Fantasy ATB system. Also the graphics and the new character models along with the voice acting took\, in comparison to the original (which didn't have voiceacting)\, huge steps forward\, although I still prefer Advent Children Sephiroth. For people that love Final Fantasy I definitely recommend buying it\, people that love RPGs in general and have no or only small ties with Final Fantasy should maybe wait for a pricedrop to 40 or 50 Euros (or the equivalent currency in their countries) or rent it from a friend for a few days and play the first few chapters for themselves.TLDR: Great game for fans of Final Fantasy\, very very good but relatively expensive (comparing price and content) game for RPG fans.… Expand"

As an all time fan I have been overjoyed at how the characters have been handled and expanded upon. It was like seeing how things were meant to be but couldn't be shown well enough back on the Ps1. The gameplay is also fantastic and is new and fresh\, it has a good blend of the classic turn based mixed with a new action\, hack and slash flair. It also has variety in switching characters and each has a different play style to delve into making for a real satisfying and deep experience. The visuals are absolutely incredible\, however there are some texture issues such as doors looking particularly bad at times but I'm sure they will be fixed in a future patch. Everything is just such a pleasure to look at and is brimming with atmosphere\, sometimes you just have to stand there as cloud and really take it all in.In conclusion I think this really is a return to form for square and a real good comeback to being the Kings of jrpgs\, it really is everything I could've hoped for and I cannot wait to see what the next installments of the new FF7 series will bring.

These hooded sand-ghosts flying around scenes and influencing the action\, I kept trying to interpret this new addition to the narrative\, I tried to settle on it just being a device to show the planet trying to direct the heroes on their path\, or even Jenova cells deceiving them.Something just didn't quite sit right though\, they looked\, and behaved quite like 'Nobodies' in the KH series\, a thought which broke the immersion and brought me back to a reality where Tetsuya Nomura was at the helm.I remember how awful the KH series had become\, how much of a let down FFXV was\, how convoluted and contrived the plots were\, and how cringeworthy the FFVII expanded universe had been (perhaps bar some parts of Crisis Core\, though a lot of it was very\, very 'anime').And so\, with that sick feeling in my stomach I reached the last few chapter of the game\, knowing in the back of my mind that things were about to go off the rails\, at least to some extent.Suffice to say\, things were worse than I could have imagined. I don't need to describe the events of the end of this game\, but it was truly\, truly disappointing\, and actually quite saddening\, to see what could have been such a celebration and honouring of an all-time classic be corrupted.After the end credits I found myself quite upset if I'm being honest. It's the same sort of feeling that the final season of GOT gave me\, or that feeling when a band you love 'sells out' and starts playing cheap\, formulaic pop songs.There's quite a few thoughts and questions I've been ruminating over\, now that I'm starting to digest what's been done in this game.Why did they call it 'REMAKE' and not advertise it as a completely new story\, or even a sequel (I think the events of the game point towards it being more of the latter)? I think I would have not pre-ordered\, and would have set my expectations very differently\, had this been the case. I suspect money could be the only reason I feel duped as a fan of the original.Who decided that the story should be drastically changed\, and indeed be changed by none other than one of the stinkiest\, hack-iest tropes of story telling in time-travel and alternative universes? I suspect Nomura had a big hand in this\, given his track record on creating absolute messes of narratives in recent game he's been heavily involved in.The thought that angers me most is that the original FFVII is a piece of art\, it's no longer something should be though of as solely owned by its creators. It's in the hearts of many\, many fans\, who give the game and story its honoured place as a classic through their fandom and love for it.The more and more I think about it\, I feel like Nomura and co. have little to no respect for the fans that have given their work this love\, and perhaps even harbour some contempt for them wanting to see their childhood imagination and memories of the story realised as they deserve to be.There is a certain arrogance to twisting this world and story to their own whim\, as if to say that \""this is our world\, our characters\, what you fans think means nothing to us\, we can do what we want with them and you can get f**ked if you disagree\"".Perhaps I will come to terms with the fact that there will probably now never be a full and proper remake of this game\, keeping the original\, impeccable narrative intact\, whilst fleshing out the world and characters in a tasteful fashion. The first 90% of this game achieved this goal\, just to throw it out in the final hour or so.Perhaps I'll let it go one day\, and try to enjoy the sequel\, though I won't hold my breath given how truly awful the new writing at the end of this game wasYou were so\, so close to perfection\, but I suspect egos\, pay-checks\, and influence are too much a factor at Square-Enix.… Expand"

The pronunciation of Mako is different than I thought it was as well.I’m hooked\, if you liked the original or are a fan of rpgs or good stories I general you should buy this and help support and encourage them to make another sequel\, hopefully If this is a big hit they’ll have even more resources to make perfect sequels in years to come.… Expand"

The battle system is different and challenging and exciting\, but it gives a very different feel for the game. Instead of feeling like a force getting stronger and stronger to the point where you're unmatched and need to seek out ever more powerful monsters. Where with every battle you get a chance to marvel at the grandiose magic effects and summons you cast. Remake makes you feel more like you're just getting by\, always pushed to the limits enemy after enemy\, and you'll spend most your time looking at the health bars\, ATB gauges and small section of the battle trying to actively evade and block attacks.Don't get me wrong\, it is a fun and captivating battle system\, one that grows on you and I wish future FF games adopt\, but it gives a very different gameplay feel to the game compared to the original.Beyond the battle system feeling so different\, remake improves on everything else. The story is deepened\, the characters are well enacted and have their recognizable personalities. The world is gorgeous. Midgar is actually made interesting. I found the missions were well designed and kept me engaged\, I even enjoyed the side quests. I also love how they show you that there are secrets for you to find\, but don't tell you how\, making it into a bit of an exploration puzzle.

I can't wait for the next installment\, and see where they take it!P.S.: I was hesitant at first with splitting the game up\, but this new take on Midgar really sets up the story better in my opinion.

I'm not getting these '0' and negative reviews - it's a beautiful game and very worthwhile.It is heavily story-oriented\, leaving me wanting for more gameplay\, to be released into the world. The main game had this portion of the story very on rails as well\, so the scope of the game was detrimental to this specific entry. That said\, they were able to add small elements of freedom\, which was very bite-sized and wasn't completely satisfying. Their reuse of all of the areas was creative but again seemed a bit like spreading a little butter over too much bread.That said\, the game is remarkably beautiful\, fully polished and rang true to a remake. The boss fights were tough\, variable and interesting. There were a lot of ways to build your characters. I found the gameplay very interesting\, though there is room to improve. My main gripes with the battle system is that it felt a bit too messy sometimes- I couldn't properly use abilities\, spells\, items because the actions took too long to animate. It basically took out the element of skill and planning if an enemy can jump across the screen and immediately stop you. I suppose this is supposed to make it more challenging but I found it was often hard to tell when that was going to happen. If there was a buff that could make you uninterruptible that could provide a good solution.I hope the rest of the game is less on rails...

This is a beloved story and many have been wanting to experience that story again with the outstanding graphics\, beautiful updated soundtrack and incredible combat system.To diverge that hard at the end feels unnecessary and unearned. Imagine watching Iron Man and right at the end you see a fight between Thanos and Tony. It doesnt belong there yet cause they hadnt built that up yet. Throughout the game we fought robots and regular enemies then in the end we fight the manifestation of fate? arent we getting more games to complete the story? i mean where do you go after fighting god? That is what FF has always been about in the end\, but this game wasnt the end! If a story goes through multiple installments then you need to build up to the big fight throughout all those installments. Also it seems like the party is trying to escape the fate of the original story\, but why? that was a good story. Sure it didnt all end with everyone alive and completely happy\, but everyones arcs were completely fulfilled. why would they want to escape it?That is ultimately why I gave the score I did. May not be fair to lower this score due to a worry about future games\, but that is the feeling I am left with. Not triumph\, not looking forward to whats next. Just worried things will become overly convoluted and confusing like they are in Kingdom Hearts. FF7's story is already pretty confusing. I am not saying that it cant be done. That they cant diverge from the original and end up with a new fantastic story\, but they are going against the an already beloved and fantastic story now. Messing with that can be dangerous as we have seen  with other IP.I was looking forward to this one coming out and now im not sure if i want the next one if it messing with something i already love. I get the argument is that \""they need to do something new cause the old one already exist\,\"" but to that I say its been over 20 years. How many times have we seen superman or spiderman remakes throughout the years even though those are the exact same story points. Each is shown slightly different but still hit all the beats we love. They could\, and largely still can do that here and many would love it\, probably more than they do this. Just please dont turn this series into another kingdom hearts with too many releases to keep up with and what can quite possibly be the most confusing story in history.… Expand"

Square Enix is a shadow of what Squaresoft where back in the 90s\, when FF6\, FF7\, Chrono Trigger and so on where being churned out - legendary game after legendary game. So hopes were not high for me\,FF7 Remake had the unenviable task of following a gaming juggernaught\, needing to both appease the fans of the original whilst giving the same service to modern gaming sensibilities. Square Enix is a shadow of what Squaresoft where back in the 90s\, when FF6\, FF7\, Chrono Trigger and so on where being churned out - legendary game after legendary game. So hopes were not high for me\, especially after the somewhat disappointing FF15.But here we are with the remake. Is it as good as the original? No. In many ways it doesn't even come close to it.But is it better than any reasonable person could have hoped for? Absolutely yes.I'll start with my complaints. First\, this really didn't need to be episodic. The padding is borderline criminal - particularly the numerous pointless side quests - just to expand the Midgar section into a 'full' game. Midgar in the original was actually just a few hours long; it just felt longer because of teh quality and depth of content that was crammed into that location. Remake simultaneously fleshes out the world of Midgar but makes it much more shallow feeling at the same time.That said\, you don't really have to worry about avoiding spoilers for the next few years until the next part\, because this isn't a straight up rehash of the original. Instead\, the story - initially following the original beat for beat - goes off on a mad tangent towards the end\, and honestly I feel this is to the detriment of the game. It feels like they were in a desperate rush to introduce certain characters. The story also lends itself to another issue the game has - extreme linearity. Not as bad as FF13 with the endless corridors\, but not far off from it either\, because the game wants to hit story notes one after the other and therefore has little time to allow the player some individual expression.They are flaws - and big ones - but it would be remiss of me not to now focus on the positives\, of which there are many more. The combat system - my biggest fear of all going in - is beautifully done. The incorporation of materia into a live battle system has been majestically done. I thought I'd miss ATB in Remake and it would sour the game for me; remarkably it hasn't. The characters are spot on - again\, my fear was they'd be diluted and taken too seriously\, but no; the comedic element is there\, the voices (for the most part) are perfectly fitting and the expansion of the side character development here is a definite improvement over the original. Graphically\, this is absolutely gorgeous - Midgar feels alive\, the characters are animated wonderfully - it is in every way the world you imagined in your minds' eye when playing the original with those blocky little characters. The anticipation to see Cosmo Canyon etc. in the next episode for me now is HUGE!I have long felt that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy 7 was the most beautiful\, complete\, awe-inspiring soundtrack in gaming history - one that tells a story in its' own right. The remake reaffirms that view for me - it is glorious. Yet... for me\, not quite as impactful as the originals. I think the music is too... smooth? It's hard to explain\, but I think the lower quality \""abrupt\"" notes from the original left more of an impression\, especially in the flow of the game in Remake and when the sound effects in battle seem to drown out the battle theme.Overall\, despite my fears about it going in\, FF7 Remake is an easy recommendation to make. At least for me. I feel that a lot of your enjoyment of it is going to depend on your expectations going in. If you're a FF7 veteran\, try and bare in mind that this isn't a replacement for the original; it's a reimagining of it. The original still exists for you. It was never going to be as good as the original for you.But for those new to the game or even the franchise? Here's your perfect jumping in point. Enjoy!… Expand"
75997,FFVIIR,2020-04-10,3,"Most people knew that this wasn't going to be a shot-for-shot replica of the original game which is fine\, but the ending to FF7R completely derails from the original to the point where semantics of what a 'remake' is becomes irrelevant. It uses the history and characters of the FF7 universe to start a brand new story on an alternate timeline. Characters that should be dead\, no longer are so fundamental motivations and character arcs are out of the window. The next parts will be starting fresh and this should be extremely worrying to anyone who knows Squares recent history. Square no longer has the ability to create new stories that are coherent or interesting. This is why people were excited for a remake of a story that everyone already loved. They couldn't possibly screw this one up and yet they still have.Aside from the ending\, there are plenty of other negatives too. Filler is a major problem. The side quests are almost all basic filler fetch quests. \""Go here\, kill x enemies\, come back\, go somewhere else\, repeat.\""  I've seen people defending this saying that you can't create a 30+ hour game without some padding. I don't understand this at all. Either make the game shorter or make the \""padding\"" GOOD content. The game is much more linear than I expected. Almost every single walkable area in the game is a narrow corridor.The hybrid combat system is actually pretty good but there are big flaws in the AI. The enemies always agro on the character that the player is controlling and your allies do very little to help or defend themselves. This combination seems to be Squares way of ensuring that you switch characters often but it is so poorly executed and feels forced.The camera sucks in combat even with the recommended changes to the settings. You can't see what you're looking at half the time\, especially if the enemy is above you.There is also a serious texture problem. The worst being looking down to the slums from the plate. I believe that this will be fixed in the day 1 patch though. It needs to be.It sucks to give this game such a low score. FF7 is my all time favourite and I really wanted this to succeed. The game gets some things right\, and when it does\, it absolutely nails them. But sadly there is just far too much crap surrounding it\, that i'm left disappointed overall.… Expand"

The visuals are impressive and the character moments are well written and expertly animated. The environments are full of ingenious details\, with plenty of delightful voice acting. It was a challenge in itself to structure a complete experience from the introductory sequence\, and the developers achieved it.However\, there seems to be a noteworthy difference in direction between the original concept from Hironobu Sakaguchi\, and the new vision from Tetsuya Nomura and Motomu Toriyama. The gloomy and foreboding mood has given way to a more dramatic and eager pitch reminiscent of other entries in the series. The central theme of loss is somewhat diluted amidst the everyday side content\, and the convoluted changes to the main plot\, while surprising\, ultimately lean toward a more generic story. The gameplay elements are varied and entertaining\, but also less effective at conveying the atmosphere\, with a very linear pacing and emphasis on busywork.All in all\, this is a refreshing return to the universe which provides beautiful vignettes and flavorful if less focused additions to the context. It certainly has its own charm\, but it will not haunt me as much as the original. The meta-narrative implications could be notably improved by what comes in the next part\, but at this point\, they do not quite stand on their own.

The new battle system is better than AXB system from FFXV\, its not anymore hack and slash because of ATB system. Classic mode is very bad.

I like the concept of the new  theme being introduced but it further waters down a surprisingly under-developed story. Whenever the game gets you on the edge of your seat\, a left-field plot thread is introduced that interrupts the current story thread you are engaged  with\, completely undercutting the pacing. Characters contradict themselves frequently and we don't get satisfying story arcs for any of them. Cut-scenes are poorly directed and character dialog is atrocious\, sometimes nonsensical.Gameplay-wise\, there is little depth to battles until about 3/4 of the way through the game. Equipment upgrades are few and inconsequential. When you do finally need to be careful about managing your stats and abilities\, the game has under-prepared you. There are very few monster encounters even if you do all side-quests immediately when you get them. Money s not good for much but potions that refill your magic (ethers)\, and you will often find that you don't have enough. The game tends not register correct player input during its dozen or so minigames (some of them mandatory). The worst sin of all is the frequency with which you are forced to walk (as in : not run) behind characters for 10 minutes listening to them go on about errands\, or shimmy between buildings.Of all the FFVII characters\, I liked Barret best and I like him best in this version too. It is really a shame that he is put down RELENTLESSLY by the rest of the party. A lot of scenes with the female characters are gross too\, and not in a humorous way. Part of this may have to do with a misunderstanding of how flirting in Japanese translates to English. A lot of dialog that may have been intended as jokes comes off as pandering or even creepy. At  one point\, Cloud\, Barret and Tifa are searching a men's room for an air duct\, and Tifa asks what she should do if somebody comes in and sees her. Barret replies\, \""Drop and show them the boys\"" (sic). Now\, that was funny\, but not in a good way; in a sloppy way.Despite being disappointed by the execution\, I am still glad I played the game\, especially the last few chapters. There is nothing in this game that Square-Enix nailed\, but it is pretty enough to keep you wondering what happens next.… Expand"

Not only are the remakes of the original songs phenomenal\, but the new originals are truly inspired and beautiful. And then\, of course... there's the gameplay.The gameplay is primarily focused on 3 major master crafted systems: Combat\, Character Progression\,As a fan of the original\, this is a masterpiece. The music ques\, the characters\, the writing\, the visual style... they nailed it. Not only are the remakes of the original songs phenomenal\, but the new originals are truly inspired and beautiful. And then\, of course... there's the gameplay.The gameplay is primarily focused on 3 major master crafted systems: Combat\, Character Progression\, Mini Games. Start with easy stuff: Mini Games are a huge improvement over the original\, while capturing the charm and adding diversity to gameplay. Whereas the original is infamous with the mini games\, because of the controls\, this remake is so smooth that the games are truly fun\, with charm intact. The character progression is deeper than the original\, while not scrapping the initial design. Instead\, it TAKES those original systems and adds to them with complexity that fits perfectly and allows for a lot of customization and optimization. Finally\, the combat: The combat is probably the best combat system in any final fantasy game ever. It has a fairly deep action game that takes place in real time\, with a similar atb system (timed battle system) pulled from the original and layered on top. Succeeding at the action side\, allows your ATB gauge to fill and then issue commands like an oldschool rpg and then watch those commands play out in the real time battle. It's masterfully made and exceptional.The negatives: 1. Fairly linear\, with lots of restriction as to where you can go in an area. I think this is an intentional design to allow the PS4 to run the game very smoothly\, without having to render too much. The narrow paths and lots of blocking structures allow the game to run with phenomenal graphics\, without sacrificing frame rate (this is my guess). 2. Some technical issues like slow loading textures. 3. Can't use items from inventory menu (not a big deal\, just odd). 4. Limit breaks reset at the end of each encounter\, which means you use them significantly less and that's a shame (most battles are not long enough to allow limits to be used). 5. Side content could be improved in future games of the franchise. Basically\, much of the side content acts more as \""optional objectives\"" in a chapter\, rather than proper side quests. This isn't bad\, as it enriches each chapter with their inclusion\, but it isn't a replacement for proper side quests.Neutral: Story has some interesting differences\, as they have expanded significantly on the original. This will either be good\, neutral\, or bad for you\, but I don't think it's objective.  It's also arguable how much this really \""changes\"" as opposed to how much it simply adds and expands.… Expand"

I decided it would be interesting to compare the two and the choices taken are.... Interesting. For people wanting the original game but brought up to speed with modern games\, you're gonna be disappointed.For the most part\, I like what they've done. The game looks great\, the battle system is really enjoyable\, they've fleshed out the main and side characters to make them so much more interesting. The city of Midgar and the different sectors feel much more alive\, giving it so much more depth and reason to do more in these areas as well as hitting all the key points people remember.Unfortunately making the game only consist of Midgar (which was only the first 4-5 hours) means they had to add padding to make this a full 30+ hour experience and my god did they pard this out. Most of the side quests are dull and are purely there to extend playtime. Very small\, brief and insignificant parts are stretched too far and make sections of the game a chore just to get through. The game could easily have been condensed into a 10-15 hour game and personally would have been a better option for a more reasonable price.The worst thing for myself is how they have changed some key aspects of the story. I won't go into spoilers but what I would consider memorable scenes no longer exist and events added that just don't belong there purely because they wanted to rush the story. Sephiroth doesn't even appear in the original Midgar section but for some reason appears all the time. It just doesn't make sense.Long time fans should pick this up as a comparison but I am glad I played the original first and still hold that as the supirior game… Expand"

Period. 10/10.-The last portion of the game is suddenly KingdomHearts-like and makes heavy uses of meta-narrative. This is not a bad thing per se...But in this case\, it messes with everything FFVII has ever been. It really feels like you're playing a different game... and not in a good way\, a choice that can very well ruin future installments. I'm not surprised that OG fans are pissed about this (Even if leaving 0/10 reviews is childish\, please don't).The only consistent aspects of this game are:- The soundtrack. Beautiful\, beautiful soundtrack.- The battle system.At first I was not sure about this but the more I explored it... the more I fell in love with it.To the point where I almost earned the Platinum Trophy even if\, as said\, I think this is a game that barely misses being an 8/10.Worth the money.… Expand"

Tackling such a beloved title brings with it many expectations.The developers must have had their own expectations because much of the work that had been done early on by an external studioFinal Fantasy VII remake has the unenviable task of trying to live up to the critically acclaimed original that is now 23 years old. The development team certainly had a huge challenge before them. Tackling such a beloved title brings with it many expectations.The developers must have had their own expectations because much of the work that had been done early on by an external studio had to be scrapped. Development was moved in-house. This included a change from the Luminous engine to Unreal 4.In the lead up to release many fans (myself included) were worried about the proposed episodic nature of the project. In addition\, the departure from the turn-based combat of the original also worried me as I hadn't really enjoyed FFXIII.The end result then is a surprising result. What we have is a much deeper look at the city of Midgar. What once was a 5 hour opening in the original has been expanded across 40+ hours of meaningful content.It goes without saying that the upgrade in graphical fidelity is striking. Character models especially look fantastic. However\, some environments have some lackluster low-resolution textures that can be a bit jarring next to these high fidelity models.Beyond the said graphical overhaul? The biggest draw here is the characters. As was the case in the original you have a memorable cast of characters. Those you thought you knew before\, have a lot more nuance here. The portrayal of these characters is supported by an excellent cast of voice actors. More surprising is how characters that were a mere afterthought in the original are fully developed in this remake. Biggs\, Wedge\, and Jessie are all great characters that each get their time to shine. You also get a number of fresh ancillary NPC's like Marle in the sector 7 slums that make this feel like a real-world these characters inhabit rather than just a theme park.The combat feels like a blend of the turn-based original and more hybrid action RPGs of today. Each character can have various abilities that can be learned via weapons or from Materia. Tactical mode pauses the action slightly giving you that more traditional feel from the original. Enemies are relentless and seem to aggro the currently active party member. This means you need to switch between characters regularly. This becomes especially useful during boss fights. That isn't to say that it's not without issue. Sometimes the camera can be inconsistent and due to the enemy density at times? It can be hard to get your footing again if you lose a character or two.The materia system returns here and it is just as fun and satisfying as it was in the original. You can employ some clever pairings of Materia to come out on top. Or unleash a number of fantastic summons.I know that some would rather have had the main game and feel Square Enix took a shortcut. But the game I have played shows a passion and care for these characters and this world. I say that as someone that was and still is a bit concerned about the episodic nature. How many installments will there be? How long will Square take to finish the whole journey?Some have said Square lied. I feel Square had been pretty transparent about their plans for an episodic release. It even says on the back of the box that the game covers up to the party's escape from Midgar.Should you finish the game? There is a hard mode that removes the ability to use items and really makes things a challenge. I am still going for the platinum.Finally I would just say that the story does take a bit of a turn. I can't go into too much detail without giving spoilers. But I think if you go into this with an open mind? You may be pleasantly surprised. I didn't think I would ever say this about a remake of FFVII but I really have no idea where they are going next. That unknown is worrying due to Nomura's writing and but at the same time? That unknown is also exciting.… Expand"

73668,FFVIIR,2020-07-11,7,"I’m just going to review what I absolutely hated the most about this game and what I loved the most about it. Now what I hated more than anything else this remake had to offer is.THE ARBITERS OF FATE.The arbiters of fate (or whispers) first make an appearance when you meet Aerith during the opening bombing mission and during the course of the game you come to find that the Arbiters purpose is to ensure that the remake follows the same events as the original story because as it turns out you’re playing in an alternate time line and not at all in the originals time line. Sephiroth is revealed to be aware of all the events that took place in the original story\, which would suggest that he somehow time traveled from the future of the original game’s plotline and is now trying to alter the remake’s plotline by pitting Cloud and the rest of his party against the Arbiters of Fate in order to defy their destiny that they had in the original games universe and all this to change the course of history in the current timeline thus definitively changing the course of the story for all future installments of this remake. Try and wrap your head around that. This is the very reason why I just wanted the same game with current gen graphics because I knew that Square would go into kingdom hearts territory and ruin it. I wish they would have just left the story untouched because now Aerith might not even die and Zack is still alive and that takes away the emotional impact of the story for me… but oh well it is what it is just have to accept it at this point. Now that I got that out of the way onto what I loved the most about this game and that is.THE CHARACTERS.The character development in this remake is nothing short of amazing even better than the original which is something I really wasn’t expecting going into it. I’ve played through the game twice so far once on normal and once on hard and it’s always a joy to watch all the dialogue scenes between these characters even minor characters from the original game are featured more prominently here and this addition is more than welcomed. Having played the original countless times I initially thought it might not be as exciting as it was in 1997 to watch the same scenes and interactions play out even with current gen graphics well fortunately I was wrong about that and Square has managed to get every character right in this remake even Cloud who I was the most skeptical of after seeing what’s been done to his character since the release of Advent Children. As for the chapters without a doubt one of the best chapters in the game is when you get to Wall Market between the renowned cross dressing make over\, Don Corneo’s mansion\, the underground colosseum and even a humorous hand massage scene there’s something to delight and entertain old fans and newcomers alike. FF7 is basically a Japanese anime and like an anime the Japanese voice cast is usually better than the English voice cast but after listening to both I can’t decide which one I prefer more all the voice actors here really did a remarkable job in bringing these iconic characters to life as a long time fan I couldn’t be happier with what they did here.All in all I didn’t love the remake but I didn’t hate it either there were many things I liked about it and many things I disliked about it. As far as comparing it to the original it’s nowhere near as great but that feels really unfair to say being that this first installment only covers about 10 to 15 percent of the original game.… Expand"

Iba con mucha ilusión ya que soy fan de la saga Final Fantasy aunque no los he jugado todos. Las primeras impresiones al jugar a este Remake no podían ser mejores. La historia es un calco de la original añadiendo más zonas jugables donde te cuentan más sobre Midgar y sobre los personajes ya que en el original era todo muy plano y no empatizabas mucho con ellos. La recreación de los escenario y Midgar en general está a un nivel altísimo quitando zonas muy puntuales donde las texturas no cargan. Pero para mí eso no es un problema. En cuanto a los personajes\, depende de gustos\, pero para mí son increíbles\, tienes una personalidad increíble\, todos ellos. Mi favorita es Tifa y Aerith no se queda atrás. El punto fuerte del juego es el combate\, un action JRPG muy táctico que tienes que aprender a manejar. No sirve con aporrear el botón cuadrado\, tienes que utilizar habilidades para agotar al enemigo y que sea vulnerables para infligirle más daño\, ya sea con ataques físicos\, mágicos o con objetos. En el nivel difícil se vuelve un autentico reto\, y más si quieres sacarte el platino con los jefes extra. En cuanto a la historia y su final\, me han gustado\, dejando incógnitas para el futuro que ya veremos que ocurre\, pero sinceramente\, prefiero mil veces esta parte de Midgar que la del original que dura 8 horas.

73693,FFVIIR,2020-05-17,2,"Chapters 1-17 are amazing. Chapter 18 really feels like a slap in the face. I'm not a die-hard \""purist\"" oldschool fan and I didn't play the original as a kid\, so I have no nostalgia for it and no \""mental remake\"" to be drawing from.Most of the changes are stuff I would never have noticed\, and I regularly liked characters and plot points that (reportedly) weren't in the original. But the big changes\, the bait-and-switch changes\, (e.g. retconning out major character deaths\, inserting time-traveling-ghosts\, turning an otherwise realistic and likable Aerith into an all-knowing prophet in the last 2 hours of the game) are impossible not to notice because of how jarring and out of place they are.I couldn't believe how mean-spirited it was for them to basically cast the original creators and the people who loved the original game as the new villains via the \""arbiters of fate\"" nonsense plot. I was really excited to play the remake and get to experience the character-driven story about the inevitability of loss and the permanence of its effect I had heard about\, with the benefit of PS4 level graphics and incredible combat that the original just can't deliver in 2020. The remake is not so much about loss and permanence anymore... it cheapens death by retconning formative losses out of the timeline while explicitly rejecting permanence\, turning grounded and relatable characters with grounded and comprehensible stakes into a convoluted alternate-timeline nonsense tornado filled with cartoonish superheroics about fighting destiny (AKA fighting the original impactful and well-written story and anyone who liked it apparently) or some nonsense.I have lost all interest in playing future installments and feel honestly kinda betrayed and just... empty. 9/10 for the first 17 chapters\, and I wrestled with giving the overall game a 6/ or 7/10 because it really is great and worth playing\, but it takes such a hard\, insulting left turn in the last few hours that all my love for the preceding hours\, my excitement for the next installments\, and my interest in the game overall just... evaporated.  I'm one of the people who actually LIKED FF15 and the new look and feel of FF games.

It has many good qualities and fans of final fantasy should still play it.However a message to all of you 9+ reviewers out there; seriously?If my complaint below wasn’t a thing I’d say this game is worthy of a solid 8/10.But realistically this game doesn’t hold a candle in comparison to God of War. Both essentially remakes\, both with action combat\, small explorable environments\, side quests and many other similar gameplay aspects; Except GoW is worthy of a 10.But here’s why I’m so upset I give this a 2/10 instead of a 8/10:Replayability is a joke\, hardmode is just stupid. It's completely easy until you reach some core boss storyline boss fights and then it's way too hard. The cheap cop-out of hardmode is to just \""remove item usage\""\, therefore MP management is the entire concern of hard mode.Game breaking bugs exist\, in the sense that you are forced to reload your game\, such as crawling in ducts in chapter 16\, if you view below while crawling to see some nods talking\, you will be unable to “press circle to exit” and are forced to reload your game. So if you don’t save often\, or use auto save mostly\, you wasted at least an hour of your life\, and more if you did some challenges. There’s a few similar bugs throughout the game and I’ve experienced it once previous\, while some other people have up to 4 different times in a single play through. Absolutely unacceptable garbage\, it’s not like you’ll have to do some ridiculous glitch moves to make it happen\, nope just play the game casually and you'll likely encounter this\, so SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN.In closing;Much like many legitimate people on youtube and twitch who reviewed this game\, an honest review is to say that this game does a lot well\, and a lot bad. It's both opposite sides of the spectrum at the same time with very little middle ground\, and unfortunately the bad outweigh the good in my opinion.If you can get over the story changes (it's still mostly the same story)\, great. However for me\, the game leaves me wanted to play more\, to play a real NG+\, but instead we're left a poor excuse of a hardmode.Oh\, and Red XIII is awesome but you can't play as him\, and the ending cutscene/fight was pretty ridiculous. Might as well have imported scenes from the Advent Children movie.This is my first true LOVE HATE game.… Expand"
