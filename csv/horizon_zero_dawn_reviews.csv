I loved the story\, I loved playing as Aloy\, I loved the combat\, and I loved this new world Guerrilla Games has created. And I especially love how fresh this felt. It truly felt like they took a risk and that's become a rarity.This is one of the few games where I enjoyed all the sidequests and even ended up playing the 'filler' content like collection quests just to spend some more time in this world. The map isn't the biggest ever\, but frankly I am so tired of people bragging about how big the world of a game is while hiding how empty it is.This place felt great. It was beautiful\, had varied environment\, was filled with gorgeous plant life and had real NPCs. By which I mean that they felt alive. They are going about their day\, and they all look unique. Sure they reuse some faces\, but there is clear effort put into this characters you will literally just see in the background. it also helps a lot that they give each tribe in the game a very distinct look\, which just aids in giving them a more real feel.I loved Aloy and all the side characters\, I just wish there was more content for all of them because I got exited to talk to all of them.The sidequests are all tied to characters with names and a little bit of story to them (it's sad that isn't the norm for all games but I still remember 'widower' from da:i) and all of them add to the world building. Even the errants (the lesser side quests) can have some interesting content. Even something as 'filler' as 'clear this bandit camp' has an interesting character tied to it who tells you something more about this world as well.Hunting the machines is so much fun. And there are so many of them. And they kind of adapt when you keep attacking them. Really I spent so much extra time in the game just playing a machine hunter.The story has some familiar elements\, but it's told in a way to still be very engaging and the end monologue had me genuinely moved.It does have a small sequel tease at the very end\, but honestly the story itself is told entirely in this game\, including why the machine dinosaurs exist and that is refreshing in a time when many games leave giant threads hanging just to pull you in for a sequel.While this isn't part of the story or the gameplay I also really love the photomode and it has kept me playing longer than I would have.This game is already one of my all time favourites.… Expand",true

The combat is great\, and more importantly it is challenging\, fast-paced and in the end satisfactory\, with machines that will really make you run and roll for you life like never before. What I feel is the strongestHorizon Zero Dawn is an ode to single player and open world gaming. The game plays fluently\, Aloy is versatile and easy to control\, giving you a smooth and enjoyable gameplay. The combat is great\, and more importantly it is challenging\, fast-paced and in the end satisfactory\, with machines that will really make you run and roll for you life like never before. What I feel is the strongest point however\, is the story. The first day I saw the trailer at E3 2015\, I was immediately interested in discovering the reasons behind the apocalyptic open world that you will explore\, and I was not disappointed. The story surprises\, shocks and fascinates\, keeping you gripped until the epic grand finale. Aloy is of course at the centre of the story\, a strong\, funny\, emotional\, and sometimes insolent (to others) character with which you will fall in love with\, making you care for her\, which is something that not a lot of games manage to do. But it is refreshing to see that all of the side characters that you will meet in your main quest or in side quests\, although secondary to Aloy\, are well-written and interesting nonetheless. And of course something must be said about the open world. It is gigantic and wonderfully designed\, making each region of it beautiful and unique while making you feel little and insignificant to such vastness\, but most importantly it is packed with things to do and to discover\, making exploration interesting and rewarding. However\, even if this review has been a general praise of the game\, I must talk about the only problem that I had with this game\, and make no mistake it did not ruin my experience at all\, but was still annoying. My issue with the game is the day and night cycle. The in-game night is as long as the day and it is really\, really dark\, and though sometimes fascinating\, it makes the combat and exploration a bit more uninteresting and underwhelming. But I repeat it did not ruin the experience as a whole.… Expand",true

It makes up for this with such gratifying combat and stealth mechanics that I spent days ignoring quests and just hunting Stormbirds and Thunderjaws instead. It is one of the most enjoyable games to be simply playing.Horizon Zero Dawn's main story may echo familiar sci-fi setups but it twists and rejuvenates them in original and fascinating ways – when game publisher CEOs talk about transporting you to new worlds\, they’re talking about games like Horizon Zero Dawn. The environments Aloy traverses are spectacularly designed and rendered and\, again\, echo places and include monuments we know but in enormously emphatic and poignant ways. The machines are exceptionally well-designed in relation to their roles in Project Zero Dawn and obviously take deliberate inspiration from our own world. In praising the work of Hannah Hoekstra and Ashly Burch in their excellent portrayal of Aloy\, it’s easy to overlook the many other characters and performances that bring HZD’s world to life while the soundtrack leaves a lasting impression with Julie Elven’s haunting vocals soaring above it. The game’s side quests are compact stories in themselves\, never repetitive or dull\, and sit comfortably and meaningfully in the world. The game is a joy to play.Sumptuosity. 9/10.… Expand",true

So often you just have to stop\, go into photo mode and capture a shot of the landscape.The world map: Nicely varied landscapes ranging from forests to mountains to desert to tundra.The story: Very engaging\, you're gripped from the start. The characters are compelling and the voice acting is well executed. The story also maintains an element of mystery about it for the most part too\, with each main quest unravelling the events of the past and how the world came to be in Horizon Zero Dawn. The plot teases you with bits of information as you progress\, but leaves you wanting to find out more and so keep playing.The combat is fantastic\, as is Aloy's (the lead character) movement in general. There is great satisfaction in the fluidity of the player movement in this action-intense game.A variety of upgradable weapons and armour\, as well as unlockable player attirbutes keep player progression interesting and prevent it going stale. And you don' have to go through dull time-consuming fetch quests to upgrade to the best gear either. You will gradually pick up everything you need as you play. There is great value in this.The game difficulty is set about right too. The game is not too easy and effort is required to take down the biggest beasts (sometimes I would have to plan out how I was going to use the landscape to my advantage to take down a large mechanical beast\, and which weapons would be most effective in the process). However\, the game is not so difficult that the flow of the game is hampered and you end up rage quitting.It is immediately clear when playing Horizion Zero Dawn that a great deal of effort went into making this game. Everything from quick menus and menu clarity\, to the collectibles\, to the engaging storyline\, the quality combat and the gorgeous landscapes has been so well executed. Certainly one of the best games to come out of this generation.… Expand",true

I found it novel and interesting but I can see how others wouldn't enjoy it as much. The characters are engaging and believable although some of the interactions outside the main story were less than interesting.The combat style is fun. The controls have a very Far Cry feel to them but the mechanic of knocking parts off an enemy and then using those parts to defeat them is a great idea. There's a lot more that can be done with this idea and i can't wait to see how it evolves in future games.The main character Aloy is a breath of fresh air in an industry that is packed with contrived characters seemingly added for the sole purpose of virtue signalling. Aloy's frenemy Sylen is an interesting character and I'm really looking forward to see how he returns in the next game.This game has an engaging story and fun combat dynamic.

With its diversity of weapons and enemies there are many approaches to a fight and on normal difficulty it is a perfect balance between casual and strategic fighting\, and once you get a certain piece of equipment you can go all out even if you are the kind of player who wants to stay at full life all the time.The gameplay is very smooth and polished and really fun and the voice acting is really good.With The Witcher 3 and The Last of Us this game is in my top 3 games I ever played.… Expand",true

Here a few notes:Graphics: 8/10\nThe game provides some incredible visuals no matter where you are on the map. I played it when it was already over 2 years old\, so I wasn't expecting to see the BESTThis is a difficult one to write because I have so many good things to say about this game\, but I do have some major gripes that are keeping me from giving this game a 9/10 or 10/10. Here a few notes:Graphics: 8/10The game provides some incredible visuals no matter where you are on the map. I played it when it was already over 2 years old\, so I wasn't expecting to see the BEST graphics that I've ever seen. But needless to say\, I was impressed and sometimes even moved by the beauty of this game.Narrative: 7/10Aloy's journey is a beautiful one\, but I found that the story itself had some weak points that started to lose me. It's somewhat predictable\, but it carries itself with enough confidence that there is a payoff in the end.Protagonist: 9/10One of the game's biggest strengths IMO is Aloy's character. Her story is written with care and it doesn't take very long to become engaged. She's got an aura about her that makes it easy to root for her\, and makes playing that much more fun.Characters/Interactions: 4/10This is probably just me being super picky\, but this is definitely one of the games weakest points. There's absolutely no depth in any of the side characters\, which is not the worst thing in the world\, i know. Video games are video games\, and there's going to be cheesy\, \""video-gamey\"" dialogue\, I get it. But man\, the cringe is strong with this one.Villain: 6/10There's nothing that really stands out here. I wasn't overly impressed by the villain(s) in this game\, but they were fine. Nothing that I can complain about\, but also not much that will stick with me for years to come.Editing/Cutscenes: 4/10Again\, just not much here to write home about. I hate to overuse this word\, but it just feels cheesy. Almost every mission is the classic \""Ahhhh! Help me! I can't find XYZ!\"" taking-head-style cutscene that we've all seen a million times. For me\, it gets old and takes me out of the game. Spice it up a little bit!Gameplay: 10/10If there's one thing Horizon excels at\, it's the combat and gameplay. Taking down robotic animals has never been more fun! With a plethora of different weapons and ammo types\, it's impossible not to have a blast finding some creative ways to defeat your enemies.Overall\, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed. I went into this game expecting it to be a 9/10 or 10/10 type game\, and I tried my absolute best to ignore the things that were bothering me. But in the end\, I couldn't overlook those things. Don't get me wrong\, this was still a very fun game and actually the first game that I've ever achieved Platinum. So I'd also be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. I'll say this\, the DLC showed some VAST improvements on some of the things i was complaining about\, and that gives me hope for Forbidden West.

Anyways for a start this is one of the best looking games ever and the best looking game on console by far. Uncharted 4 is a close second and thats it. Ten hours in and I never get tired of just walking around climbing and doing nothing lol. Gameplay is so addictive. Every encounter is different. You have to figure out their weaknesses and how to move and respond. The story is surprisingly more engaging than I thought. Actually it seems to be very well written so far. Obviously in 2017 it is hard to avoid cliches with being raised and the loner type person but you cant really criticise that. Crafting and armor and weapons are great and diverse. I know there is a lot more because I seen somebody a few days ago in a playthrough with the whole weapon wheel filled so I'll just say myself that its very in depth. Nothing bad apart from slowish close combat at times and a few not the best executed voice acting lines but not game breaking. Its open world so with all the dialogue needed to be recorded thats something I could forgive and forget. Overall the voice acting is great. So far 10/10 and I don't see myself changing my mind… Expand,true

As many reviews have already said\, this game looks stunning.  Having just bought an HDR ready TV the visuals are gorgeous and there were several occasions where I got Aloy to just stand and look around at the stunning vista in front of her.  The story is excellent and the mix of late 21st Century technology and primitive Sun worship work together really well and getting involved in the tribal bickering and gradually unwinding what actually happened on Earth in the long distant past is great fun.  Wandering about and coming across a herd of mechanical beasts and hoping that they don't spot you really has you on your toes and taking down some of the bigger beasts such as a Deathbringer is very\, very rewarding. And using your focus to highlight the weak-points of each beast is very useful.  I did find the way Aloy fought a bit annoying at times because sometimes the camera would hide Aloy and sometimes I found myself in Focus mode when I really didn't want to be.  Fighting is not easy at all\, even later on in the game when I was at Level 34 it was still tough to beat the likes of a Stormbird or even a flock of Glinthawks\, but\, at least you can craft halfway through a battle to create more ammo :-)This is far more of an action game as opposed to a fully-fledged RPG.  For example when you enter a town you can't enter any buildings\, there are no guilds to join\, like you would in Skyrim and the SKill tree\, if you can call it that\, is very basic.  One a plus side this makes the progression of the game much easier than other RPG's as it's very easy to keep track of your Main Quest\, Side Quests and Errands.All in all a great game\, with a great story\, stunning visuals and an amazing central character.… Expand",true

Some of the textures like wood etc might need to be bumped up a little bit but that is just nit picking. The character models both in game and cut scenes are some of the best this side of PC in my opinion. If you own a 4K tv with HDR capability you must play this game on it! The lighting during sunsets and also moonlight stalking is more than worth it!The score and sound design are really nicely done as well and makes you even more immersed within this world.The story is heartfelt and unfolds well as you progress and will keep you interested throughout your 30 to 40 hours + of gameplay. I literally had to stop myself to go eat and walk the dogs it is that addictive! Toilet breaks be damned too!Combat is both fun and fluid which is rare in gaming these days. If you own a PS4 Pro you will be treated to an even better experience. Truly some of the best combat mechanics in any game of this genre I've played and I've played most of them. Similar to The Witcher 3 and Tomb Raider combined. Very well done Guerrilla.Do yourself a favor and pick this gem up especially now when it is half price. It is a modern classic that I hope will become a franchise so the developers cam improve the experience even more!I won't give it a 10 because there are very few games that would deserve this except for Bloodborne and possibly Skyrim (at the time).

Outcast from her tribe since birth\, she has had to prove herself to everyone around her for entire life\, testing herself not only against the traditions of her tribe\, but a dangerous wilderness filled with hostile\, animalistic robots. And\, controls permitting\, she does\, and then some. It's just that game fights you for her success at almost every turn.Before I talk about Horizon's true strength\, I need to talk about its weaknesses. Where Horizon stumbles is always in its mechanics\, and\, admittedly\, in its odd facial animations. Some of these are small annoyances: the limited inventory space compared to the sheer volume of pickups\, or the drop rates on certain resources. Or the fact that it relies on a crafting system at all\, as it is about as much a survival game as Mad Max is: which is to say\, not really. Some of the problems are a bit bigger\, such as the circle button being used for both backing out of menus and dodge-rolling: perhaps off the nearest steep precipice\, something that happened to me at least four separate times and killed me each time. Or the oddly temperamental target tracking on melee attacks. Or the incredibly janky and nigh-useless mount controls making so that you are better off navigating on foot.Setting aside my personal dislike for archery as a game mechanic\, there is a fundamental disconnect between what the player is capable of versus what the enemies do. You will constantly get hit by enemies\, as the dodge and sprint are insufficient to evade them. Enemies will also frequently interupt your arrow draws\, knocking you all over the place and keeping you always on the retreat. You are given a variety of weapons other then a simple bow\, including such technological marvels as a slingshot\, as well as some actually interesting devices such as a burst-fire auto-crossbow and tripwire launcher. Each of these has specialist ammo types\, some of which seem to encourage direct combat\, but for at least the first half of this dense title you are seemingly discouraged from direct combat with the enemies for the simple fact that they will beat you in to the ground\, over and over\, with no mercy invulnerability\, forcing you to mainline healing items just to stay in the fight\, with the occasional exception of the lackluster human enemies that can be dealt with just by arrowing them in the head for the most part. The intent seems to have been to use ambush tactics and fight creatively\, but the longer I played\, the more I wished I just had some kind of gun so i could tear through the enemies and get back to the interesting part of the game: the story. I can say this because there are rare occasions that they DO give you a gun\, allowing you a few precious seconds of glorious automatic fire or explosions before the weapon inevitably exhausts its magazine\, forcing you to revert to plinking killer robots with goddamn twigs.It became so tedious that I even lowered the difficulty from normal. I'm not one for playing on \""screw you\"" difficulties\, but a game should not be so frustrating on normal. Even when they give you some flashy elemental launchers with good damage and status in the Frozen Wilds expansion\, they saddle them with astronomical resource costs compared to the vanilla weapons. I nearly exhausted my supply of chillwater\, a resource used for ice-based ammunition\, built up over the course of the entire playthrough\, just dealing with the especially superfluous \""Kill all the Fireclaws\"" quest tacked on to the end of Frozen Wilds' main questline.Overall\, the longer i played\, the more I wished that Guerilla had taken lessons from their own past\, and had combat similar to say\, Killzone 2. Nonetheless\, I soldiered on through the bulk of its content\, largely because of its aesthetic quality.Horizon is a very pretty game\, make no mistake. The landscapes and character designs are some of the best I've seen in any game\, in fact. But where Horizon truly shines is its story: it has a quality of voice work\, storytelling\, atmosphere and world-building that combined creates a narrative and setting strong enough to carry the lackluster gameplay through to an emotionally charged conclusion that quite literally left me in tears. If Horizon were a film\, it would have been a damn good one.I can't give Horizon a green rating\, but it is worthy of note regardless.

It could have easily been a mediocre\, fun experience just running with that. What Guerrilla Games actually delivered was\, as lead writer John Gonzalez putts it: \""something that's beautiful in every dimension\"".You can feel the passion and creativity that was lovingly poured into this game by people wanting to create something wonderful as opposed to a sorry lot being forced to churn out lucrative AAA mediocrity by slaving through \""crunch time\"" under an oppressive whip.Gameplay:This isn't your typical open world game that quickly loses its flavor like cheap bubblegum. Each encounter feels fresh. Whether you're sneaking around a bandit camp\, running for your life from an onslaught of cultists\, fending off a robotic T-Rex and its buddies in the cramp confines of an underground factory\, or sleuthing out a fruit burglar; It rarely feels repetitive or boring. HZD nails the satisfactory feeling of scaling sheer cliffs and the visceral crunch of your spear making contact with a machine. Each encounter rewards you for taking a moment to devise a custom strategy around it.Story:As a fan of hard sci-fi\, I was delighted to uncover a deeply thought-out explanation for why the premise (primitive tribes hunting robot dinosaurs) actually makes perfect sense\, but HZD's story takes it several steps beyond providing a sound logical explanation for the premise\, it tells the story with an emotional resonance that ended up bringing me to tears several times. A story of people clinging to hope in a hopeless situation and gut-wrenching sacrifice on unimaginable scales. It also ties the protagonist in deeply while providing a fresh\, semi-subversive twist on the \""chosen one\"" trope. A trope I typically find dull and tired.While you're uncovering the mystery of the world's past\, you also have to navigate the rich\, complex politics of the present: A hand full of colorful factions with their own vibrant cultures\, histories\, and beliefs which make sense given their geographical origins yet also seamlessly reinforce themes of the mysterious past.Characters:Aloy has become possibly my favorite fictional protagonist of all time. Her story is expertly crafted so that the player effortlessly empathizes with her as you both discover the world together. Her dialogue is an absolute treat. The few (maybe three?) times I skipped dialogue from some long winded NPC\, Aloy echoed my own thoughts with some razor-sharp line about the NPC talking too much. It was like the game knew what I was thinking.There are dozens of well developed supporting characters too. The writers somehow managed to make me love a complete sociopathic monster who lives to kill. Going in to the game\, I had a specific twist to the ending spoiled for me ahead of time\, yet; as the story unfolded\, I couldn't make sense of what I knew about the twist and the character involved who I came to understand during the course of the game. It wasn't until late in the final chapter that all the puzzle pieces started to click and all the character motivations became crystal clear. Nothing ruins a good character faster than poorly reasoned actions and confused motivations\, I'm happy to say HZD never commits that crime despite the overwhelming attention to detail that interactive media demands on story writing.Art:No need to write much here\, you've likely seen videos and screen shots. Every frame is a painting. If you have any understanding of the technical challenges Guerrilla Games overcame to build their engine\, your jaw should be through the floor.  Moonlight bleeding through leaves. The way the whistle to call your mount echos in a snowy valley. The fact that mountains in the distance look like postcards\, but you can travel to those mountains\, scale them\, and look back at where you once were. No copy-pasted\, pre-fabricated set pieces. The terrain and villages are all generated naturally. This isn't Red-Dead-Redemption-style flexing by making horses poop as though that's the height of interactive entertainment. It's all in the name of emersion and in service to the game.I could write volumes about why this game is about as close to perfection as the medium is currently capable of\, but I'm running out of characters. Just play it. You won't regret it.… Expand",true

86541,Horizon1,2018-09-27,9,"This is a memorable and beautiful game\, and worth buying a PS4 to play.Simple crafting and RPG/ skills elements make it a little deeper than some other open world games.Machine combat\, which is most of the enemies\, is excellent. It always feels fair and makes you think tactically\, and choose the right approach for each enemy. The machines are really quite impressive\, each quite different\, with good artificial intelligence. Some are dinosaur themed (Thunderjaws\, Watchers) but most aren't- there are a lot of misleading comments about this. They are mainly intended to replicate modern fauna- deer\, cattle\, wolves\, lions\, crocodiles\, tigers\, crabs\, buffalos and others.The core story is very strong\, and the overarching background is actually quite fascinating. Learning the truth of the machines is a gripping journey.There is plenty to do\, and its fun to just get into fights to see if you can make it out alive.The environment\, with its stunning views\, weather and water effects\, wildlife\, swaying grass and ambient sounds is second to none. And there are plenty of collectibles and tasks to get you to explore it all.Downsides?A few\, but not enough to spoil it.Fighting the human enemies is fairly unsatisfying. Most can be easily beaten by picking them off by stealth or simply culling them one by one with a spear.The side stories are mainly pretty dull\, consisting of rescuing hapless villagers from machines/bandits\, solving crimes by following easily signposted footprints or blood trails\, or acting as a glorified courier. There are a couple of exceptions.Aloy's sarcasm gets a bit wearing at times\, and is a bit out of place for most of the game; until she becomes a genuine badass.

This is a very good game that does a lot of things well and has a fantastic concept.  I was immediately interested as soon as I saw the first trailers and was very much looking forward to getting my hands on this one.  I'm a big fan of the post-apocolypse genre and the mix of terminator style machines taking over the globe and humanity living on in tribe like bands amid the ruins of an advanced technological society looked really compelling.  For the most part this game lived up to expectations but it does fall flat in some areas.Pros:  The world itself is main selling point of the game and I got more enjoyment out of simply traveling from one place to another than from doing most of the quests (more on those later).  Visually the game is amazing and you definitely get a sense of awe while exploring.The combat is also a big plus.  The enemies are still quite tough even when you are leveled way up and a planned out strategic approach will often pay big dividends.  It can get tedious fighting so many of the same enemies after awhile\, but it's easy enough to avoid or run away.  Fighting humans definitely gets boring but the robots are really well designed\, difficult to take down\, and definitely feel threatening.There is a large variety of different activities to keep things interesting like hunting grounds\, collectibles (especially the banuk pieces)\, cauldrons\, quests\, etc...   Some are better than others and the rewards aren't always worth it\, but it's still nice to have the option.The crafting and upgrade system is well implemented with an intuitive\, smooth interface that doesn't bog the game down.Cons:  Character design is a mixed bag.  Some of them are really interesting (including the main character)\, but too many of them are one-dimensional with poor voice acting.  The NPC side quests are extremely linear and not very interesting at all and rewards are lackluster so I just stopped doing them pretty early.While the main story is good enough to remain interesting but there are a lot of things that really bugged me about it and you really have to suspend belief to maintain immersion.  For one thing\, there are data points conveniently dropped EVERYWHERE and too much of the main story is propelled along by just recovering data points that just happen to be laying around for you to pick up after centuries of non-use.  Also - it's pretty ridiculous that such technologically backwards people can go toe to toe with super advanced robots using bows and arrows.My earlier comments about the visually stunning above ground environment do not extend to the dungeon/ruins delving portion of the game which I found to be very lacking.  I found the ruins delving to be a major slog and the environment just looks terrible compared to the above ground portion of the game.  The cauldrons are a little more interesting since those are still functional and you can see machines being built there\, but the metal ruins were disappointing below ground.The designers blatently ripped off mechanics from other successful games (most notably the Witcher and Uncharted) almost to the point where they seem directly ported over.  I understand this is pretty common in gaming but they could have done a better job of putting a unique stamp on the gameplay.Overall though these gripes are fairly minor but they are enough of issue to break immersion for me and keep this game out of my top tier.  That being said I easily got my money's worth on this title and I look forward to what Guerilla Games has on the Horizon!… Expand",true

The ending give a big \""Sequel\"" that Sylen revived hades and captured him just to get more knowledge from the past. Showing the relation of the past of what happened before the present was really interested and astonishing. Especially the relationship between Elisabet and Alloy. What got me disappointed was the two people Alloy met during her \""Proving\"" forgot their name since you only know them for 5 minutes and they are also dead but the names I'll give them are \""The Bully\"" and \""The First Friend\""\, just wished they could've lived longer to have a big relationship with Alloy.Gameplay: Very entertaining but a little disappointed because when it comes to fast travel the player would have to buy them at at workshop but the ingredients for them (Yes they are ingredients for making fast travel) are not that difficult to find\, I thought fast travel would occur during the middle or mid-end of the story arc. Using the Focus is really cool when hearing audio recording and tracking enemy patterns is good way of the getting the upper hand of the game. But the final boss was awful as its just all machines are just going after you\, nothing different\, nothing more.Characters: Alloy is awesome\, she's smart\, badass and very dependent when taking responsibility. Including her mother Elisabet who sacrifice herself to save the world that was about to be extinct. Seeing their relationship made me felt accomplish for beating the game\, also for Rolan it made my hart sank a little seeing him sacrifice himself to save Alloy. All other characters are amazing too\, even though they act ignorant but that was part of their culture.Machines: They are some fascinating creatures when traveling the open world\, and for the team has put so much effort into making each machine deserve to be best gaming design for Characters. Even fighting them was the most accomplishing thing I did when playing this game. Just wish you ride mostly all of the Machines that you override especially the GlintHawks\, flying on those would be greatest game/adventure ever!Conclusion:Story is amazing\, Final boss is a disappointment Characters are well created and the machines designs are spot on!

The side missions is repetitive too\, follow the trail to find somebody which wants a item which a machine have which you must kill it to take... When I realized that at 2/3 of the main mission I complete I stop doing every side mission and just rash to the main missions to complete the game.

If you're a Monster Hunter fan\, than the huge monster battles in Horizon Zero Dawn will seemI ended up enjoying the game quite a bit\, because for the most part I enjoy an open world RPG more than the next fellow\, but it's far from the masterpiece that some people say it is.First of all\, If you've played Witcher 3 and Breath of the Wild\, this game will not feel fresh to you at all. If you're a Monster Hunter fan\, than the huge monster battles in Horizon Zero Dawn will seem simple and dumbed-down.The main strength of the game is that it's a well made game that doesn't overstay its welcome\, has solid gameplay and a good main story. I was never bored while playing it and always welcomed going back to it. It's a good looking game\, although I will say not as atmospheric as Witcher 3\, and I still think that despite the technical limitations the almost hand painted quality of Breath of the Wild makes it a much more unique looking game than Horizon Zero Dawn. I think similarly to The Wind Waker on Game Cube\, the games that were considered technically more accomplished at the time\, like Resident Evil 4 for instance\, will age terribly\, while you could still start up the Wind Waker and be impressed by the art direction. 5 years from now\, Breath of the Wild will still look good\, and Horizon Zero Dawn will be obsolete. I think the current realistic approach to video games\, while technically impressive\, make the limitations of technology all the more obvious. For instance\, when you look at the characters faces in Horizon\, you are at first impressed by the likeliness\, but then all you end up doing is noticing what isn't quite right. like facial hair\, teeth\, or skin tones. I think a skillful art direction is more important than realism.While I did say that the main story is interesting enough to hold your attention\, I can certainly not say the same of any of the side quests. The other main issue is that literally none of the characters are interesting. (save for maybe Alloy and Sylens\, although that might be due to Lance Reddick's performance) They are absolutely milquetoast and cookie cutter stereotypes that remind us all too much that we live in a post Witcher 3 world. The game gives you plenty of documents to read and audio files to listen to\, which would be fine if they were interesting\, but they are anything but. I think I've had more fun reading the phone book.Having said all of that\, I understand that with a big open world like this\, comes limitations\, and it's still an impressive effort from the devs. The variety in monsters is quite good\, and some of them are genuinely challenging before you understand how to approach them\, or get very overpowered once you unlock all the good equipment. I liked the hunting challenges\, and collecting the right parts to unlock armors and upgrades kept me entertained for a while. The game is on the shorter side for an open world RPG. You could easily finish it in 30-40 hours if you focus on the main story\, 60-70 if you're a completionist. But that is a blessing in a way\, because the game would overstay its welcome if it lasted any longer.In conclusion\, if you like open world games and are not expecting great characters and amazing side quests\, you will enjoy this game.73/100… Expand",true

The setting is a far future apocalyptic Earth where feral machines roam the planet like wild animals and mankind survives in small primitive tribes warring against each other. The story is amazing with some cool and interesting twists.  The combat\, however\, is the big selling point.  It is deep and surprisingly difficult even at average difficulty.  If you go into nearly any fight without doing your research you will lose a ton of resources\, health and maybe the fight.  There are dozens of unique robot enemies\, each with their strengths\, weaknesses and weak points.  Dozens of hours into the game and I was still finding new enemies to fight.  The open world is huge with biomes ranging from ruined overgrown cities\, to desert\, snowy mountains and jungles.One issue I had is that stealth is a lot harder than other similar games like Assassin's Creed or Shadows of Mordor.  Enemies spot you very easily\, even with stealthier gear equipped and when they do spot you they (mostly human enemies) alert the entire camp instantly.  Some camps are designed where stealth is all but impossible\, or at least very time consuming.  Some stealth abilities like Death from Above or the Ledge Grab I've never used because their were no good situations to use them.Loot is randomized and always crafting supplies and upgrades.  Every type of weapon or armor must be bought from vendors and every vendor has the exact same inventory.  Would have been nice for some variety.The voice acting of a handful of the main characters is great but some side characters\, especially in the beginning of the game\, is hysterically bad.  I'm looking at you young Nora warriors.The combat is the biggest selling point of the game.  It is probably the hardest of recent games I've played on the PS4.  It's both a plus and a minus.  I love the difficulty which usually consists of targeting small weak points hidden on a machine.  Certain ammo types will remove that component or destroy it causing massive damage.  The problem I have is that\, being a native PC gamer\, I'm not great at targeting fine points with the controller stick.  That's my problem\, not the games.  I don't want to lower the difficulty because I like the challenge but I wish I had additional settings options to help me.  Like lowering aiming sensitivity on the right stick.  If you lower sensitivity it lowers your look sensitivity in and out of combat making everything painfully slow.  Or maybe a setting to increase my bullet time slow down or even lower the speed at which time is slowed.  These enemies are brutal and you'll find quickly in the game that even standard enemies can seem like boss fights especially when fought in numbers.  All enemies have perfect aim that never miss and must be dodged.  There are no blocks in the game.  All machines have melee charge attacks that require near perfect timing to dodge.  All fights are challenging yet very rewarding.  Even after I finished the main story I went back to punish myself for more.… Expand",true

Geniální koncept a nápad. Skloubit jakoby pravěk se scifi se tak často nevidí a tady to navíc vypadá luxusně.

Průchod příběhem není vůbec k zahození. Postupně se snažíme přijít na důvody narození hlavní hrdinky a navíc i na to co se stalo s původní civilizací. Tady k tomu bych měl jednu asi největší výtku. Zjišťování co se stalo se z větší části děje přes textové datové nosiče\, hlasové záznamy a hologramy. Vše se to děje vždy v rozbořených budovách původní civilizace a navíc vše až na výjimky se to děje v reálném čase. Za mě to ubírá na intenzitě. Kolikrát jsem jen stál na místě a četl nebo poslouchal nějaké informace. Mělo se to více dít v cut scénách. Bylo by to mnohem více vtahující. Ty hlavní zvraty ohledně minulosti se tam v cut scénách stanou ale dalších 50% důležitých věcí se přehrává někde v pozadí a nebo přes postavičku v hologramu. Chtělo by to více vyvážit. Navíc průzkum těchto ruin je dosti jednotvárný. Úzké koridory téhle hře nesvědčí a docela tam zlobila kamera.Když jsem na té vytýkací vlně tak ještě úvod hry byl docela naprd právě kvůli stejnému problému co jsem před chvíli zmínil. Člověk se teprve seznamuje se světem a je hned na začátku hozen do jedněch takových ruin. Chápu to příběhově ale hratelnostně to bylo moc dlouhé a bylo to takové prkené. Jakmile ale tahle část skončí tak úvod hratelnostně už v pohodě.Tohle je asi jen jediná výtka a navíc k jednomu konkrétnímu prvku/části. Jinak se ta hra….parádně hraje. Strávil jsem tam celkem 35 hodin a mám splněno 80%. Svět je překrásný a vábí k průzkumu. Každé nové prostředí je zajímavé a každý nový robot hned křičí (nebo chce vás zabít) k prozkoumání. Komplexnost soubojů je geniální. Každý robot má na sobě různé součástky které mají různé vlastnosti a slabiny. Navíc různorodost zbraní vám umožňuje neskutečné strategické variace na to jak je sejmnout. Můžete jít přes hrubou sílu ale stačí pár mířených ran do nádrže s palivem a nebo sestřelení krytu hlavního obvodu a zvíře lehne po pár ranách.Jak se pozná že svět funguje ? Tak že když jsem se vrátil k hlavnímu questu co měl úroveň  12 a já měl 25.

I played A LOT\, and then some more. Only every once in a while I didn't fully understand the story\, did not do too many sidequests as I was primarely focused on getting the main storyline done. That said\, ever since I played The Witcher 3 I don't want to rate a game unless I've actually finished the damn thing\, so here goes in a simple sentence: Horizon Zero Dawn is an epic piece of an adventure\, but it's wayyy too early to call it the best game ever (which title goes to TW3).Horizon Zero Dawn puts you in the skin of Aloy\, an outcast of the Nora tribe\, bla bla bla. I'm sure you've heard the primary story. Another outcast\, a man named Rost has been raising you as his own. This world is filled with robot-dinosaurs\, and some 80 different models of them\, not sure how many. It was a pleasant surprise that\, playing on 'normal' mode\, the vast majority of the bots are still damn tough to take down. Even little 'weaker' machines like watchers can be deadly\, but this is easily avoided if one goes through the game in stealth mode. Luring a machine over and giving it a 'silent strike' wipes everything out like that. A cool encouragement to do the stealthy aproach\, in which the tall grass helps a lot. In the very first trailers it appealed to me how the grass reacts to the player\, amazing. Talking about graphics\, sometimes I would take hours with photo mode to create some stunning images. There's only minor issues here\, which wouldn't downgrade my verdict so I won't mention them.The main quest is very interesting to say the least\, though at some times it may be a bit complex. No spoilers mentioned here\, some vague humour is mixed in the way people in tribes are organised. The player has to see this for themselves. The story overall had me\, from the point that I was actually making some progress advancing from just roaming the country to actually pursuing main goals\, mainly interested in how humanity would have ended and the robots taken their place\, with only some tribes surviving. Without giving spoilers\, the answer was not as 'unexpected' as some people would have me believe. Just a minor problem is how the story is as complex as it is\, frequently naming names I hadn't heard before didn't help. 'Go to this place' and only the map would show where that exactly was\, or some guy who just at that point became important\, though I expect at the next playthrough that'll become more clear. And those are the only cons about the story so far.There's a lot to say about the gameplay. I just love the way Aloy dodges stuff\, just the movement in general. I like how\, when you crouch and jump\, you land still crouched. It doesn't change the stealthy movement at all.The hitbox and climbing system though\, they work extremely well. That's a good thing\, but it just goes to show that the results are annoying\, but in the same way you feel good about being hurt watching Game of Thrones. Aloy rarely walks automatically onto a balancing rope and frequently misses a parkour-jump\, which makes it all the more realistic. Foxes won't get shot as easily when you use precision arrows\, with these hitboxes you'll sooner just pluck a few hairs from its skin.That's why I firmly believe it is my own fault when I try to shoot something but the arrow doesn't launch\, it must've been me unknowingly canceling the arrow.I find there is much too few space for\, about anything with the phase you pick stuff up.The graphics are absolutely stunning. Even better than TW3. I'll just say that. Any photo you'll make just looks so professional\, which accounts for my sudden rise of followers on imgur. The fact that photo mode makes you control time just blew my mind. So that's good.I had 1 rage quit; for some reason the enemy's arrows were OP AF\, resulting in 4x unknowing deaths.So much to say about this game and I have only 5000 characters.Why no perfect score (as The Witcher 3 got from me)? At a later point in the game\, some big battle\, a stormbird froze mid air and therefore I could take it down (so due to a glitch)\, AI sometimes is pretty dumb. I can only remember some characters\, but I have no special emotional bond with any of them. This game only rarely is a glitch fest\, but when it hits\, it's good.Why as high as an 8? Because the story is good enough to make me want to know everyting\, something The Last of uus didn't do. Graphics is a +. Unpredictability for most of the story\, almost perfect gameplay and some awesome details. Realistic humour (which would be spoilers). Very quick crafting system\, but an overall epic idea to make is battle robo dinos (for some reason I can't type the word USS).Though it did not make me feel as emotionally good as TW3 did\, the fact that I spent 53 euro on this game makes me feel I robbed the studio.

She's very appealing on many levels at the beginning but didn't develop further depths as I'd hoped and started to feel pretty bland further in and I have to say\, I think she could have been improved on as the dialogue doesn't do her justice and the voice acting is very dead pan.Back to the positives though - the combat mechanics are outstanding - the bow and arrow\, once beefed up a bit\, felt like a sniper rifle in its power and accuracy\, and the wide range of weapons available are fun and rewarding to use. It takes a while to get to know their strengths and ideal applications and once you do you can swap around as occasion demands and really kick some metal creature butt....when you're not getting your own kicked\, which happened a fair bit in my case! I found the combat challenging....in an exciting\, pulse pounding way often...and definitely had to strategise and plan my attack. There were times when that freshness gave way to grind when the game upped the difficulty by throwing more of a particular machine at you at once\, but I never got bored. Occasionally very frustrated - the Hunter Trials\, for example\, are a good idea but the ridiculously short time allowed just makes them a frustrationfest.The climbing mechanics are the best; even better\, dare I say it\, than Uncharted 4. Of course the scenery is utterly lush\, I don't even need to say that. There were times that I just stopped and looked at the view for a while in awe.The crafting system is well set out and enjoyable. I wasn't thrilled with going out around slaughtering endless numbers of cute animals to find a few of the rarer parts I needed to upgrade my gear but needs must! I thought it was a shame that I achieved the best of the gear relatively early in the game which didn't leave a lot to work for in the later game stages\, other than the legendary Super Duper Armour which is ridiculously OP but looks cool. Unlike\, I have to say\, many of her higher level outfits - who on earth thought those head hat/crowns/whatevers were a good idea??! A girl needs to look her best...If there was any lack\, I would say it was the lack of real personality or depth\, to some extent in Aloy and even more so in NCPs\, and it would have been great if settlements were more than just somewhere to stop and pick up supplies. There was token 'relationships' but way too superficial which meant that there was little deep engagement with the main character or the human world in this game. They were all patently forgettable.  More attention to that one thing would have elevated this game\, for me\, to greatness. As it was\, the game was fun but forgettable. By about half way through I was feeling a bit 'is this it?' and would have given it an 7 but closer to the end the story kicked up a gear for me and I was utterly engrossed and moved\, which pushed it up to an 8. Definitely a fun ride and one not to missed.… Expand",true

It’s very polished\, and comes with a compelling story\, relatable characters\, an absolutely fascinating setting\, and top-notch gameplay. On top of that\, its visuals will make you wonder if Santa secretly sneaked into your room to replace your PS4 with a gaming PC while you were asleep. It simply looks that good. Horizon Zero Dawn is not only one of the best-looking games of this generation\, but a must own for every PlayStation 4 owner. And anyone who is willing to buy a PlayStation 4 just for this game. You will not regret it\, I can guarantee you that.In addition to Pros and Cons; First of all\, i'll explain cons a little so I don't leave you confused. Story sure is compelling\, it was just me who found it a bit familiar but that was only in the starting quests I believe. The further I got into the story\, the more I started to like it.About the resources\, it doesn't bother in some of the stuff we have to craft but it does when we need to craft Fast Travel Bag otherwise we cannot use fast travel. And we need a few resources to craft our ammo so if you run out of resources between a fight and you cannot craft anymore arrows or other ammos\, you're dead meat. Other than this\, it's all good. Not annoying at all.About Pros- Other than those three\, Outfits and Weapons are really good. Especially the weapons. You get to have so many options and it all depends on your gameplay\, how you want to set up your own weapons for battles. You can choose four weapons and those four are enough.Last but not least\, I will recommend everyone to complete all the errands and side quests before finishing the story. Also upgrading everything to the max so you don't need to run out of ammos\, resources and potions quickly.You will need to explore the whole map for that matter but it's worth everything. Good luck!Pros:-1) Hunting Grounds is a great addition to test your skills and improve.2) AI is really good\, either NPCs or the machines. Each one of them.3) Outstanding environment and gameplay! 10/10Cons:-1) Compelling story but a bit familiar one. 8/10 from me.2) Collecting resources for crafting.… Expand",true

It's a 10 hour game deliberately padded to last at least three times as long. It's a grind and a chore.A lot of it's problems don't become evident until you cross over into the second half of the map. At that point the difficulty is steeply ramped up. Every engagement requires you to exhaust all your resources. Then go harvesting for them again. Even when you unlock the skills that give you more for every plant you pick you'll still barely fill up a notch of your health reserve before you stumble upon the next engagement.You'd think there would be some system for replenishing health without wasting your resources reserved for combat\, but no. No healer at camps\, can't sleep to regain health\, even fast traveling to a bon fire doesn't replenish them. In fact fast traveling to a camp will make you lose your mount\, which are a pain in the ass to obtain but are practically required for traveling. And\, no\, you can't capture a back up mount. You can unlock an ability to call in back up mounts but that requires at least 10 skill points.If you run out of a resource like health potions\, things you need to craft health potions\, or a resource that you need to craft arrows to fight enemies but are mostly found on enemies then you're going to have to buy it from a merchant. However\, everything is on the expensive side. The bigger problem is you can't buy multiples of stuff. You have to buy everything individually. So if you need to buy say 30 wires to craft anchor cables you have to buy them individually! If that wasn't bad enough\, it's not like you hit x and it's instantly in your inventory. Every action goes through a confirmation wheel that takes a second to fill up. Way to waste the player's time Guerrilla.Then there's the combat itself. The aiming is way too slow to manage how fast and agile these enemies are and there's no sensitivity option. Pretty much every enemy requires that you learn their weak spots\, you can't just unload a volley of arrows on them and hope they go down. Preferably you'll also learn which element goes best with those weak spots. The problem is that these enemies move fast\, have twitchy animations\, and often have weak points concealed. It's really difficult to keep your reticle on a few exposed pixels by itself. The camera zooms in when you aim down the sight and zooms in even further when you go into bullet time. When this isn't even necessary with it's already low FOV and the fact that enemies close the distance really quickly. Mixed with the twitchy animation this leads to looking at a pixel one second and then the enemy not being in your line of sight the next. The end result is you'll start mostly relying on melee and traps.Once you cross to the other side of the map the enemies themselves are tough. Every engagement feels like at least a mini boss fight. But enemies never come alone. Not only that but the poor enemy placement on the map means that an engagement with one group of enemies can spill over into another group and even a third. Imagine trying to line up a shot with three groups of boss like enemies barreling down on you. Your character often won't have time to get up before three enemies get a few hits in\, tossing you around like a rag doll. Having platinumed games like Rogue Legacy and Bloodborne I found this game too much of a pain even on standard.The respawn logic boggles my mind. As a final boss quality stormhawk that I only defeated moments ago respawned almost instantly when I moved a few meters out of the area. In another area where I came upon and saved a civillian under attack the encounter respawned in exactly that form when I came back a minute later from picking flowers to heal the wounds I sustained from that encounter. Yet\, an area that was designated with a type of machine I needed to complete a quest had no enemies anywhere close.Speaking of quests\, you can't complete multiple tutorial quests at the same time. You have to choose one as active. This kind of constant micromanaging is a big part of the problem with Horizon.The game is also buggy. I've seen things like floating plants and dead enemies. NPCs teleporting from one spot to another or their torso disappearing. The game crashed on me a couple of times too.Another annoyance are Horizon's equivalent of towers that clear the fog of war from a map. They are mobile here. Which means if you missed your opportunity to get on it\, you have to wait five minutes\, standing around doing nothing\, for them to come back around.The game does look amazing but even that's not without caveats. For one thing night time has a green hue that looks unnatural and there's too much black crush. Lip syncing can look completely off. You'll run across giant piles of snow that your character has no impact on. Just clipping through without as much as even a sound effect change from standard ground foot steps.… Expand",true

While the game focuses a lot onHorizon Zero Dawn is a science fiction\, open world action game with RPG elements. That is the technical definition of the game. However\, the game should be defined as a story about a young girl who loses everything\, but rises to be a hero in a harsh but beautiful futuristic world.Gameplay – You play as Aloy\, a young girl with a mysterious past. While the game focuses a lot on exploration the combat is the highlight of this game. The player gets a variety of weapons to take down the enemies. It is some of the most creative use of traps and bombs I have ever seen in a video game. This isn’t a game where you can run in guns blazing. Not to say those moments are totally absent from this game\, but it isn’t what the developers had in mind. Aloys main weapon is a bow and arrows. Each Unique bow has unique function or type of damage. Along with bombs and traps the player has multiply ways to destroy enemies. The combat is strategic but not in a difficult way. It’s a system that lets you be creative\, without having a steep learning curve. Whether you are discovering a cave with a secret piece of armor or surviving a horde of machines the game seems to offer something for just about every type of play-style.Graphics and sound – I played Horizon Zero Dawn on the PlayStation Pro. The developers took advantage of the Pro’s features and turned an already good look game into a visual masterpiece. Blades of grass move with the wind\, sunlight trickles through dense tree tops\, and rivers splash as they traverse through the land. These little details add so much to the experience. The game has you cross multiple different bio-domes. You start your journey in dense forest areas. Eventually crossing desert and snowy mountains. The game is based in a futuristic Mid-west America. Mostly in Colorado. The developers do a phenomenal job in capturing Colorado’s unique landscapes. They also recreated many real landmarks and locations. There was something eerie but satisfying seeing Colorado in this ruined post-apocalyptic state.This beautiful crafted world wouldn’t mean anything if the sound accompanying it didn’t match. One good example of the level of detail of sound put into this is the creak of rope on Aloy’s bow when she draws it back to fire an arrow. That was probably easy for the development team to replicate. The impressive part is all the futuristic sounds they created that do not exists. The giant robots sound as if they could actually exist. The screech and click as they move. You can hear their joints as they stomp around.Story and characters – The story of Horizon is the best part of the game. It’s the distant future and instead of an advanced society with flying cars and laser pistols\, the human race as devolved in a way. Society has reversed back to tribes and more primitive ways of living. Part of the story is discovering what happened to the world and how it got this way. Aloy is kind of an outcast in her tribe. With no parents to look after her\, she grows up in the wild\, honing her survival skills. After a devastating tragedy on her tribe\, Aloy is forced out into the world. There are so many interesting elements to the story the range from revenge to new friendships. But the highlight of the game is uncovering the mystery of why the world fell.  Aloy is one of the most interesting characters in any video game I have ever played. Because she was isolated for her entire life\, she is naïve about the world. This makes her curious. She doesn’t know deceit or cruelty. These means Aloy has flaws and makes mistakes. This allows the character to grow. While Aloy is most definitely a kick butt character. She isn’t this overpowered super hero. I think that is so important for the audience to have some sort of common ground with the character.While Aloy is the only playable character in the game\, she isn’t the only interesting one. As you travel you will meet interesting\, funny\, and sometimes dangerous NPC’s. The development team proved they can make their own strong female lead. Which seems to be a hot topic now-a-days in the gaming community. Gamers love female leads. Look at Laura croft from Tomb raider\, Jade from Beyond Good and Evil\, Jill Valentine from Resident Evil. I could go on and on. Aloy is prof we still have smart writers in the gaming industry that can deliver a powerful\, unique\, and rememberable female lead.… Expand",true

Nothing new here\, except the machines\, which are a nice touch in a prehistoric-like world. Really feels like you're in Jurassic Park sometimes.You can either play stealth with your bow or charge with your spear and with some other melee weapons and grenades. Nothing really special here but it feels nice playing as Aloy.The storyline may or may not captivate you\, but it is very well introduced. The idea of making you play with a young Aloy for the tutorial is very nice. If you open all dialogs\, there is nice backstory\, not as furnished as The Witcher\, but let's say better than other open world games like Assassin's Creed of Far CryThe graphics are immersive\, you can basically hide the HUD in the options and play the full game without it (just pick a random tutorial quest that you never complete as active and desactive all the rest). I suggest you do that otherwise it's just a \""go there\, climb here\, kill that\, loot here\"" game\, and you won't enjoy it as much. Lots of glitches and bugs though\, animals and enemies hovering here and there\, maybe patched in the future but this is a huge negative point\, as alwaysSound is good too\, when you hear machines stomping or charging\, things get messy really fast in combat though\, the music is nice too but sometimes a bit confusing\, as you may think a battle is going on when there's nothing.Combat is not really elaborated\, even if some enemies will surprise you\, there is often a cheap way to defeat a boss\, hiding behind a rock or using glitches without knowing it. Very often you are pushed back by an enemy and find yourself stuck in a place where the enemy can't reach you but you can reach him. i suggest turning off the warning indicator\, that basically tells you if an enemy in your back has spotted you.In conclusion\, you should try this game\, maybe when it's between 30 and 40€/$ and enjoy it because it is a good one for all open world lovers out there… Expand",true

Good writing basically means that the characters' actions and the world the characters inhabitThis is simply not the game for someone who needs well-written believable characters in a believable world.After spending over 10 years playing games specifically to find the most well-written stories\, I've come to find that the typical gamer doesn't notice\, or isn't bothered by poor writing. Good writing basically means that the characters' actions and the world the characters inhabit are believable. After a few hours of playing this game\, I found that both are completely unbelievable. Since the action/stealth gameplay was doing nothing for me\, I found little to like about the game.To explain a bit\, the protagonist is a modern\, politically-correct 20's/30's girl\, transplanted into a late-teen's body in a tribal/pre-industrial setting. Our protagonist was isolated as a baby and has lived in the wild\, interacting with about three other people for her entire life at the time we take control of her (as an adult). But somehow\, she has perfect speech\, manners\, and ability to deal with 100's of people at once. She's even an expert at sarcasm\, which is strange given there's no indication that her guardian taught her to be like that.She's also seemingly devoid of most young-girl desires. Love/sex? None at all - maybe she was spayed. Hate/spite? Nope - that would clash with her politically-correctness. Need to fit-in? Nothing here either - it seems like she could care less about her newly-joined society after her childhood-long isolation. Though she does have a seemingly-unfounded need for a mother. This makes little sense unless others were constantly trying to convince her that she needed one. That happened only once in isolation\, which isn't enough to ingrain it into someone. Oh\, but the plot is about finding her mother\, so we must simply accept it...So yeah\, she just doesn't make sense. Though maybe the game is trying to appeal to people who just want to see themselves in a video game. So we end up with this modern-age generic person that is meant to appeal to as many people as possible\, despite a person like this not actually existing.The world and setting has several issues too. The tribe you first encounter is tiny and appears to be modeled after nomadic hunter/gatherer tribes. I didn't see any farms large enough to sustain them and they've stayed in one spot for the entirety of the protagonist's lifetime. So how do they get food? They surely don't eat the mechanical creatures within meters of their camps.And what about those mechanical creatures? They attack and almost kill me just for walking down the road. How can their children exist with these things so close? And in my first quest\, some kid got caught up a tree with machines surrounding her while her dad was stuck on the ground with a broken foot. How are they dumb enough to get in that situation? How did they both not die? I climbed up that same tree later and the machines could attack me easily.Oh\, and those silly tribal rules seem to be made up on the spot. So the protagonist is outcast because she has no mother - why would anyone make that rule? But she can come back if she completes a deadly challenge when she's an adult - did the same dumb person make this rule? And no one is supposed to talk to outcasts. But everyone is constantly breaking that rule\, so why does it exist?  And how on earth do we have white people\, black people\, asian people\, and middle-eastern people all in the same tribe? Tribes don't normally work like that\, and there's no indication that these people just showed up all at once from different parts of the world to make this tribe.This is obviously a game about gameplay and graphics first. The protagonist\, world\, and beginning of the story is so poorly done that I have no reason to continue. Though I suppose I'll keep it for showing off HDR on my TV.… Expand",true

Everything moves\, from the tiny rat scurrying across the ground to the giant Tall Necks in the distance. You can catch yourself simply staring at the changing scenery as it transitions from day to night.- Combat and controls drive you to be situational and while most foes can be brought down with bow and arrow; through Hunting Grounds you learn how the right tool for the right prey benefits for each situation.- While character models are good; dialog can be... a bit stiff. And... just like this paragraph... you'll often find characters... talking like this. I'm not sure if the development team felt this added to the drama or simply felt line reading like that was effective; in either case it tarnished many conversations and detracted my attention from the moment to ponder the point of the actor/actress was trying to make.- I have run across a few bugs in the game; namely kills rag dolling on me after loot collecting and the occasional kill flopping around on the ground; however\, these are few and far between. Also\, I've strangely noticed in some situations after clearing out a herd\, their sound effects\, like hoof stomping or animalistic noises are still audible. But again these are few and far between.- Storywise\, the game flows nicely. Guerrilla Games gelled consecutive storylines involving humanity's past and the games present into one smooth ride. Combined with the game's side missions\, \""errands\,\"" and a handful of other activities\, most feel organic and less of a chore and more of an adventure.- Some will be turned off by the (game's) exposition about \""the past\"" however I found it pretty telling. Much like how we glimpse the past through sparse discoveries of artifacts; such is the same in game. And\, while some might wish Horizon: Zero Dawn gave us guns and technology to shoot at mechanized soldiers\, there is so much backstory\, Guerrilla Games could build an entire spinoff prequel if they wanted.- In all\, Horizon Zero Dawn gives PS4 owners a reason to be proud. It successfully utilizes the hardware to its full potential while delivering a solid game. Guerrilla Games further struck gold by pulling off a \""coming of age\"" story about a female protagonist that goes from \""Outcast\"" to the reluctant hero. Hopefully Guerrilla Games will continue to build upon this title and refine their product in releases to come.… Expand",true

The tribe takes it a step further and has made it illegal to speak toI want to start this off by saying that all of the hype surrounding this game is completely warranted. From a narrative perspective\, this game has such a strong start. Without spoiling too much\, you start out as this little girl named Aloy. She’s been outcasted by her tribe at birth because she doesn’t have a mother. The tribe takes it a step further and has made it illegal to speak to outcasts so here is this young 6 year old that just doesn’t understand why. It ends up being this great motivator because personally I want to see her succeed just because I feel this empathy for her (I’ll be honest\, I teared up a little bit in the opening sequences).I personally find Aloy to be one of the most likable protagonists that I have seen in video games. Her being shunned as an outcast from birth has made her mentally strong but not bitter towards people. It not only made her mentally strong but it kept her from being “brain washed” into thinking the outside world is a scary place. In contrast\, it has taught her to question the norms and push past tribal restrictions.Now getting into the game itself\, its hard not to compare the game to other video games out there. It certainly seems like Guerilla Games (the game developer)\, looked at what made other games successful and pulled from them. I personally look at the towers\, outposts\, crafting and cant help but compare that to the Far Cry series. In Far Cry you climb a tower and it opens up some of the world map which by itself its not bad concept. The problem is\, in Far Cry 4 there are seventeen towers to climb. In Horizon Zero Dawn\, there are five. Its the same with the outposts as well\, in Far Cry 4 there were twenty four outposts but in Horizon Zero Dawn there are only about five (it may have been six).The crafting system is similar to Far Cry or even the new Tomb Raider series. To upgrade weapon satchels so you can carry more arrows\, bombs or any other weapon you have to go hunting. You end up hunting raccoons\, foxes\, boars\, turkeys and it some cases small rats. It does start to feel a little unnecessarily “grindy”with that though because some times you will need an very specific item like a fox bone or a fox skin. So you end up running around killing foxes and most of the time\, you are not going to get what you’re looking for. I would say a vast majority of the time\, you end up with meat which is primarily used for crafting fast travel packs. Its possible to spend hours killing foxes just looking for that specific item so you can carry 10 more arrows in your quiver. So my recommendation is\, right at the start of the game\, kill and loot everything. It could save you some time later on.Now I do want to talk about something that was unique to this game and that was fast travel packs. Early on\, in order to fast travel around the world you have to craft specific packs that allow you to fast travel around the map. It doesn’t cost too much craft these packs but I do want to make it clear that it isn’t completely free. Now there is a Golden Pass that you purchase from a merchant and that does allow you freely fast travel around.  Also the good news is\, its relatively cheap to purchase\, I think it was something around 50 in-game currency dollars.The game also has an Uncharted feel with the climbing and traversing. You can clearly the markings on cliffs where there is white on the side a cliff  (or platform) which clearly indicates that you can climb up it. There are also ropes that you can climb and those are bright yellow and if you’ve ever played Uncharted then you know to look for White or yellow which this game follows that general rule. Even though the climbing does have an Uncharted feel\, the climbing ends up feeling better than Uncharted in my opinion. I think a big reason for that is\, she seems to move a lot quicker and her movement is more fluid.  Also the game doesn’t have nearly as much climbing as Uncharted does so you don’t end up getting burnt out by that.That’s the beauty of this game though\, the game does not coddle you and hold your hand. It throws you into this world and you need to figure out how to fight each every machine. The first time you encounter a machine is also the first time\, the main character Aloy encounters a machine so she wouldn’t necessarily know how to take on it either. There is a lot of trial and error with this game and what’s cool about the depth of this game is\, everyone is going to develop their own strategy with fighting these machines. There really isn’t a “right” way to do it\, its just develop your own way to do it.Finally\, I do want to talk about my biggest complaint about this game and that’s the leveling up system. At its core\, its a fine system but it caps off way too low and too early. Level 50 is the highest your character can get and that’s disappointing because you will likely do that before you finish doing everything in the game.… Expand",true

Ultimately the combat is fun enough; where you can limit yourself and make each fight a challenge.Main Character Development: [ D- ]  Anyone else that has played the game\, you can't possibly disagree with this rating.  Guerilla had said they wanted to focus on the main character entirely\, hence why there is no multi-player and they absolutely bombed. Aloy is in no way a character to like\, even if you try. She is too conceited and nothing about her is humble or adventurous...mysterious or even confident. The thing i think we all love about famous character's is their quest/struggle/learning to overcome/desire to succeed/repeated victories in doubtful situations...Aloy has none of this. From the get go she has a crappy attitude and commands respect from everyone\, she is on top all game and there is no 'challenge' or 'doubt' about her. (This part plays into the next rating)Dialogue/NPC Interaction/Questing: [ D }  You cannot possibly rate this any higher. The dialogue and interactions are cancerous. Not once\, twice\, ten times\, or thirty times\, but EVERY single SECOND the game makes it a point to put men down - Whether its a audio collectible\, a side quest\, the main quest\, or anything that exists in this game. The game/Aloy will go out of it's way to put down men\, directly...not people...men. This game is saturated with feminism and it ultimately ruined a potentially amazing game. Aloy lacks HUMANITY entirely\, the game lacks humanity because of how 'out of their way' the developers went to make it about feminism.Can anyone here name me one game where a man protagonist puts down and makes women as a whole look stupid for an ENTIRE main quest\, all side quests and all everything? No.  Master Chief\, Lara Croft\, Ellie\, Commander Shepherd\, Sam Fisher\, Cortana\, Geralt\, Nathan Drake - all main or prominent figures of games and NONE crap all over women this game does with men. They crap on the BAD guys\, as a team. Most main male character's have a female side kick as the way female main character's have a male side kick. These character have friends of both genders. They are involved with both genders bad or good...my point...THEY'RE HUMAN\, unlike Aloy/Horizon Zero Dawn.In the end this game is too cancerous dialogue and story wise. The game play is fun enough for a few hours of combat and if you have the money check it out. It is just so sad to see a game with such potential miss important features and plague their core with such nonsense. Not to mention it now puts paid critics in a tough spot if they don't like the game for many other reasons\, they could be labeled.The fact Guerilla had to make this entirely about a gender issue is pathetic. They would have made much better character/game core if they just cared about making a good game and building Aloy as a character and developing her. Instead they have no real regard for Aloy or the gameplay\, they just want to have a girl who is entitled to everything she touches and never needs to learn anything ever. Yet\, she still doesn't seem confident...it's bad.… Expand",true

While the game has some fantastic features it's plagued by some flaws that for me doesn't make it a great game - a solid game but not a great game.Graphically the game is one of the best if not the best game to come out on PS4. From the large vistas to the ruins of what is our civilisation to the dark cauldrons to the machines\, everything looks stunning. The combat does feel slick and responsive and it is rare that you feel the game screwed you over when you die. The way each machine has it's weak points means you have to take a tactical approach to defeating the larger enemies rather than them just being bullet sponges.The story is rather hit and miss for me. While I'm only approximately half way through I'm finding half of the story (the parts which focus on the world and how it's become what it is) very interesting however I'm struggling to become invested in many of the characters stories. I find Aloy is a satisfactory lead character however nothing revolutionary and will pale into insignificance compared to some of the truly great characters in other games.The major flaw with the game is it feels like it's all been done before. While the setting is unique the core gameplay mechanics are very similar to other open world games that came out 2 or 3 years ago. While the game lets you 'take whatever approach to a situation you want'  this means that the gameplay for each approach is mediocre and relies on the quantity of the approaches you can take rather than the quality of them. The stealth is basic\, while 'going in loud' per se is unsatisfactory especially against humans.The side quests have for the most part not been particularly gripping. A couple stand out as being fantastic that I really enjoyed however the majority have been either fetch quests or had too little exposition to be grab me.There are a few smaller gripes with the game that I have. Not having unlimited fast travel and having fast travel packs instead to places you've already visited just gets annoying. I remember having a side quest that wanted to drag me two kilometres. With only three fast travel packs my choices were use two up for this side quest\, walk there one or both ways wasting time having already explored that part of the map\, or walk in the opposite direction to find a machine I could ride. The same issue applies with not being able to save on the fly. During one session I had to come off the PS4 quickly and unexpectedly however wasn't near a fire to save so lost 30 minutes of playtime.Finally I had one side quest that I'd invested about 45 minutes into and when I turned up to try and free the character he was wandering around without a care in the world thus leaving that quest stuck as I couldn't advance because I still had to free said character.I see people making comparisons to the Witcher 3 and even saying this game is better. In my opinion this game doesn't come close to the Witcher other than the fact it has better graphics. This is an unfair comparison though because the Witcher 3 has set the bar as for open world games in almost every aspect especially from a story perspective.Overall\, the game is a solid game that you could put a fair amount of enjoyable time into\, however I don't think in 5 years time it will be looked on as a classic. Time will tell and I may be wrong\, but I don't see it as a classic.… Expand",true

No doubt my review will be swamped by the plethora of crap that resides within Metacritic these days\, but hey\, who cares?So\, onto to Horizon: Zero Dawn (HZD)\, a supposed GOTY contender. Heh\, really?Let's get the visuals out of the way first\, as they seem to be the main pull. They're good when you consider it's an open world being run at an almost consistent (30fps) frame rate on a console. Lighting is well done\, shadows are good for the most part and textures are more than adequate. For me\, the brown filter is horrible (I've always hated brown filters in games) and the whole thing looks so fussy at times\, I struggle to differentiate one thing from another.CGI moments are good\, but nothing that makes them stand out nowadays. Voice acting is good\, but often characters will finish talking and the camera will linger on them for a few seconds for no apparent reason. Camera direction in general is a bit odd\, on several occasions\, the CGI production\, i.e. how it's presented\, looks amateurish and/or rushed.I very rarely enable music in my games (I prefer to NOT feel like I'm a character in a film) so don't care to comment on the musical score. Ambient sounds are OK\, but levels can be way out of whack\, meaning you'll often not hear anything Aloy is muttering\, because some small stream nearby is banging away like Niagara Falls. Speech from NPCs will often playover Aloy's constant mumbling\, rewarding you with a mess of audio\, and spatial awareness can be hit and miss. Audio is therefore adequate but needs patching.The lauded gameplay and RPG elements are where I find other reviews very alarming. I'm seeing \""Unique\"" banded around for HZD quite a bit; have these people been living under a rock? Are they new to gaming? If somebody could tell me ONE feature in HZD that hasn't been done elsewhere better\, do please let me know. Within a couple of hours I'd witnessed direct rip-off's of FarCry 2/3/4/Primal\, The Witcher 3 and Assassin's Creed; albeit none of these rip-off's are anywhere near as well implemented as they are in their respective game. They all just feel bolted on and clumsy.HZD plays like a simple action game\, but tries to pretend it's some kind of profound game\, with RPG elements stuck all over the place in a failing attempt to stop things become stale quickly. The story is boring\, the characters are boring\, the meat of the game is repetitive and...boring. I'm actually bored of writing about HZD already. It's basically an open world game that's not as much fun as The Witcher 3\, or FarCry Primal\, or Skyrim\, or Assassin's Creed\, or\, or\, or......do you see the pattern here? It's obvious that many gamers here are happy with what is a very simple open world game. I can only presume they've not had much experience with other similar games that are far better in all areas. HZD is a technically OK open world game\, but surely (especially these days) games of this ilk need to provide a lot more to justify a 8+ score...don't they?As far as I'm concerned (a gamer for over 30 years)\, everything HZD is\, has been done before\, and that's because HZD has blatantly copied everything that has been before\, but failed to equal any of it\, let alone improve on it.… Expand",true

Like most open world games it pretty much overwhelms you with things to do and a gigantic world to do it in.  There are about 20 different robot enemy types and then the bandits (easy after beating a robot TRex).  The best thing about the game is the mystery of how in the heck the robots got here and who created them and what was the purpose.  I still don't know - I have like 800 hours of getting distracted by killing robots in new cool ways with all my toys (batman would be jealous).Two (minor?) gripes:  The first problem I have is that men are all wimpy whiners and the women are all tough leaders (in the game and in real life oftentimes too :P).  The men voice actors all sound like Brad from The Middle (very lispy and effeminate).  I mean in this savage world no wimpy men (or women for that matter) would be alive so that isn't even possible.  The men would be required to be strong or you would be dead or at least dead weight on the tribe\, which wouldn't likely be tolerated.  These guys would have adapted to have Testosterone dripping from their veins by now due to survival of the fittest (duh).  So expect Feminist BS (but its not in your face - just a subtle message that I didn't catch at first)\, but pretty much par for the course in this (gender role reversal) day and age.  You don't have that much interaction with humans honestly (except the one vendor per village and like 1 quest giver per village on average).  Just wanted you to be aware of it in case you that bugs you badly.  My second problem is Aloy (your character) cannot grab onto even the lowest ledges unless it is designed to be grabbed.  It can be 4 feet high and your character will jump up against it until you are screaming but she will not climb over it.  The ledges you can grab are white like a bird crapped on it.  Still having trouble spotting them - maybe the devs should have made her focus (which was a genius way to give Aloy batman like detective vision in a way that fits into the world) highlight the climbable areas.  For instance\, I found an alternate way to get to a vantage point (uncovers grayed out map and has items there) from the back side by spam jumping and I couldn't reach it since Aloy can only climb what she is meant  to climb.  I call it the Nathan Drake jump where you can't jump over anything not designed to be jumped - she's not that bad at least.  Pet peave in games - want freedom in this day and age to climb what I want how I want to.

Crafting looks random and some objects require components that look random. Why do you even need meat to upgrade satchel's size?There are a lot of unclimbable buildings and landscapes with very artificially placed climb tracks.Most of the time you hunt in open spaces but then the game puts you into closed space to fight a boss. Then you have to use skills you don't really have. Some fights require spamming an enemy with everything you have and the only problem is having enough resources to craft ammunition on the go.The world history related part of the story is ok\, the part about characters relations and motivations is weak and ignores a lot of opportunities to make itself deep and engaging. Sometimes it gives you random information it doesn't use to make the characters more believable and add additional twists to game events. Side-quest stories are quite generic. And there are not too much of them. You get more main storyline quest than side quests.There is also one thing that bugs me. Aloy never stands straight. She always bends forward with her weight on one leg. This looks awkward.Still if you get into the combat mechanics they are quite enjoyable and there is a lot of satisfaction in killing the most dangerous machines. Learning to use and using different kinds of weapons is really interesting. Each of them has distinct game mechanic and they all play well with each other adding additional tactical and even strategical level to combat.Machines design is just perfect. There are a lot of different kinds if them and they look and act in a different way and require special approach to be killed.The idea of medieval culture living on top of the ruins of old world high tech civilization works really well. The world is intriguing and gathering pieces of data about old world is one of the good parts of the game.If you approach this game as a machine hunting simulator in a vivid and intriguing post apocalyptic world you'll get a lot of fun from it.

I'm going to recommend it. let me explain how my scores work. 0 = terrible never play\, 5= its average and ok for what it is i.e. syndicate reboot or something like bfhardline. 6=good. so don't get pissed just yet!so before anyone blasts me for not bowing to sony or what not\, I actually own a ps4 and the game. the game is great in theory. What could have stood as a robotic dinosaur themed monster hunter turned into a lackluster game that failed to capture what it sold itself as. first ill start with the gameplay. It's a lot of fun when you are fighting dinosaurs that is\, not people. the gameplay against people is boring at best and glitchy and terrible at worst. But nobody cares about people right? well guess again cause a lot of story missions aren't dinosaurs\, it's about fighting boring people who are boring. The dinosaur gameplay though is awesome\, and they give you so many options. trouble is a lot of it is THEORETICALLY good. but every person has their favorite method of fighting\, and you will pretty much stick to whatever method that is. Also\, the lack of variants and special dinosaurs to fight makes for very lackluster gameplay. I wanna fight a giant robot t-rex who has a spike tail\, or maybe has cannons\, or can make use thunder strikes or what not. Not the same one.  there needed to be more variants\, or maybe even more dinosaurs as a whole. but the worst is your melee staff. it does the same combo with no different variations and has insane reach. You can glide across rocks\, water\, ice\, trees or whatever stands in your way when you combo. This may sound like a small gripe\, but it makes melee too good. It leaves your melee skills to be found wanting and instead feels like sloppy design on an otherwise pristine combat system. But to end this part\, the combat is very good. Taking down dinosaurs with your chosen form of combat or tactics is very satisfying if not a tad too easy.Graphics:. Graphics are great. nothing really to add therestory: boy howdy this is pretty dumb. it starts off really promising but quickly falls apart. I won't spoil because well I think someone else who is more linguistically gifted can better describe what happens. I will just say the ending is very much a damned if you do damned if you don't and very\, well\, anticlimactic.Characters: Aloy is great. during story\, and what not. However\, and this is where I drop some points. SHE DOES NOT SHUT UP. I'm sorta used to this. I've played the uncharted\, the reboot laura croft and what not. But Jesus aloy does not shut up. say what you will about how she's cool\, or an icon\, or a strong role model. but she is making quips non-stop\, talking non-stop\, and never fails to have something to say. That gets very annoying very fast when it happens too often. I want aloy to learn the Nathan drake type of bants. You get nathan who bants when other people are there (as in companions)\, or after or before a boss fight. Or during set piece or sequence. it belongs with his character as a smartass. Aloy is an inquisitive person who is always ready to voice her thoughts and opinions\, especially when it comes to discovering new things and better understanding the world. She is curious basically. That does not mean she is going to talk every 5 seconds with a line. it gets super **** annoying. the npcs are dumb. LIke holy crap their dialogue is either really good\, with certain side missions. I won't say which ones cause you need to either watch em or play em for yourself.  And other times it's very poorly acted or written *cough cough The forgotten cough cough*the rest i guess: animations: animations are poorly done. Every time you enter a cutscene that isnt part of hte main story (well for the most part those are fine\, there are some that are very noticeable) you are met with what i like to call robot mode. robot mode is where characters in the ingame cutscenes or dialogues forget how to act like people and you can see them turn and react like robots. LOOKING AT YOU THE FORGOTTEN. people act so unnaturally stiff and robotic that it comes across as though these people were suddenly made into puppets\, at the whim of a puppeteer who doesn't exactly know what its like to see a human talk or react. the animation is so off-putting sometimes its emersion breaking. again the forgotten is my main gripe. Seriously bad all around and probably one of the most notable moments of \""we stopped caring\"".I like this game\, but its simply not up to snuff. It's great points shine like a diamond freshly polished. But it's unfortunately\, the smudges of the above problems that also dim that shine down quite a lot. It's these small problems that very soon turn from a small pile into a very overtly large hill. It's definitely not a mountain of problems because I still recommend the game. but these issues shouldn't have been issues had guerrilla cared enough to take the time to polish. horizon gets a 6/10… Expand",true

There are actually many in game snapshots that are barely distinguishable with real life.- The machines are amazing! Well designed\, looks amazing\, are unique\, and move and fight in a very smooth and fluid way. Each machine has different strength and weaknesses and has multiple hit targets that can change the outcome of a fight. This is different than most games where a 'headshot' is all you need or as long as you hit the target they'll take damage.- The story is actually well written\, complex\, and believable. Many stories are cool but feel 'off' because they're not relatable\, too convenient\, or are completely non-existent. The story here is very real and the characters react to it in very realistic and emotional ways\, urging you to imagine yourself in their position and imagining what you would do.

Sidequests are also well done. The  idea of tearing some robot's component apart to disable their specific weapon is awesome. It adds fresh feeling  into its genre. No glitchs no bug I found in my first playthrough with hard difficulty. Gameplay is fun.However\, there are something holding me back from giving 10/10. It is just a bit but it could be improved.1. The game focuses too much on range weapon. There is only 1 melee weapon\, spear\, and you cannot modify anything. It is fine for those who love range weapon\, but for me who like to use melee. It is a bit disappointment since in this era\, melee weapon should be use more often. They should have more type of melee weapons\, such as axe and shield or sword. At least\, the spear should be able to add fire rune or ice rune\, for exp.2.Story is very great for beginning and middle\, but near the end of main quest is somewhat not strong in my opinion. Some parts I feel irrational but I don't want to say here to not spoil anyone but I hope it ends better and stronger. Final boss is not that impressive.3.Aloy has no character's development. She is like a god of hunt\, beat everything no sweat but has almost no emotion. She should express herself more. Her character is too stiff and too confident in my opinion. For example\, Rost's incident\, she get over it too fast ....  unrealistically fast.4.Music is not epic enough. I cannot remember any songs that catch my ears to feel Wow. It is a shame for the game that is as great as GOTY title but music is not on par with other aspects. Battle music is below average.In sum\, Horizon Zero Dawn is very great game. If you have PS4\, you should not hesitate to buy it. It is not as good as Witcher 3 but still one of GOTY contenders for sure. If you like using bow\, this is the game for you. If you are melee guy like me\, maybe you love the game or maybe not\, but I am sure it will not hurt to try.

HZD is essentially Far Cry Primal peppered with elements from otherInitially\, Horizon Zero Dawn captivated me with its touching prologue\, but that impression quickly faded. Horizon doesn’t break new ground. The story is full of exhausted tropes and needless obfuscations. Combat is unrefined. Visuals are impressive for a console game\, but that isn’t enough to justify it as a system seller. HZD is essentially Far Cry Primal peppered with elements from other popular titles. Guerrilla Games proved that playing it safe is still the go-to strategy for developers.Visually\, HZD is remarkable. Performance is smooth without any noticeable aliasing or texture popping. The long draw distances are impressive. There’s an option to turn down graphics from 2K to 1080p in order to boost performance. Regardless of which option is chosen\, Horizon is always locked at 30fps. Players are not told which features are disabled. So it’s a pointless setting. At 2K resolution\, HZD runs at 30fps. At 1080p\, HZD runs at 30fps. So what exactly is the benefit?Combat would’ve been passable in 2007. We’ve seen dozens of popular games with exceptional combat since then\, so I’m surprised by HZD’s simplicity and tedium. Running around will get Aloy stomped unless players pause every minute or so and activate their Focus scanners. Most skills are situational\, so Aloy has few options if she’s caught off guard. Melee is clunky and suicidal. Generally\, HZD pushes players to plan every attack using stealth and then take down enemies with ranged attacks or traps. Combat would be more fun if the enemy AI wasn't so dumb and Aloy had better mobility.At other times\, Aloy is forced to engage enemies directly. After the prologue\, HZD throws players into the fire with multiple lengthy\, and rather difficult\, boss battles. Players who didn’t stock up on equipment will be demolished. Difficulty spikes occur often. Boss battles can be inflexible encounters that affront HZD’s stealthy gameplay norms\, similar to Dues Ex: HR. HZD just had to include absurd time trails that every forum seems to hate. In most games\, trials are ridiculously contrived challenges that hold back average players. They’re shoe-horned in for the sake of content.The parkour elements are limited to set pieces just like Assassin’s Creed. If two ledges are the same height\, Aloy can only climb the one with a colored indicator. Aloy is presented as a nimble\, athletic warrior. Yet Guerrilla intentionally hamstrings her. Small boulders and 4ft fences are insurmountable obstacles. Guerrilla should’ve followed Dying Light's example with seamless parkour transitions. That would've radically enhanced combat diversity and added replay value. Many areas look traversable\, but invisible walls keep Aloy grounded. It’s inexplicably stupid game design.Aloy's skill tree contains plenty of useless abilities. Most stealth skills suck because of the design issues mentioned above. Scavenging perks are redundant since resources are plentiful. The best perks are generally the first and last ones in each tree. Additionally\, weapons in each class feel samey. Overall\, progression isn't as rewarding as other combat focused games like Batman.The story was HZD’s big selling point. The first hour or so is solid. After that it quickly devolves. Much of the story is locked away behind obstinate characters who simply will it that Aloy remains ignorant. HZD injects “shocking” cut scenes to evoke emotional responses from players. But deliberately killing characters in ham-fisted fashion is not imaginative writing. HZD is set in an interesting world\, but its story falls short. Aloy is given “choices” which have zero impact on events. They usually cue different dialogue\, that’s it.The world is static until the story progresses. NPC’s hang around regardless of Aloy’s actions. I rode into a village on a deadly machine and everyone ignored it. Tribes are deathly afraid of machines\, but I can bump into people with nary a problem. The human elements of HZD are flimsy and unconvincing.HZD travels well-worn roads paved by the other franchises. Most elements imitate Ubisoft’s playbook: climb something tall to unlock map\, clear bandit camp\, help hopeless locals with bandit/animal problems. Menu navigation\, skill trees\, combat\, and survival features were lifted from Far Cry. The focus scanner replicates the witcher sense from The Witcher 3. Scripted parkour elements mirror Assassin’s Creed. The list goes on. Despite all that borrowing\, nothing is improved. It’s like listening to a 90’s mixtape. Sure\, most of the songs are catchy\, but it’s always fun to experience something fresh. There’s nothing fresh here.Critics and gamers alike fell head over heels in love with Aloy. But she isn’t enough reason to give HZD such high marks. If anyone is thinking of buying a PS4 to play HZD\, don’t. HZD is boring and generic. The threadbare story and stilted gameplay makes this a once and done game without much replay value.… Expand",true

Hatters are indeed going to hate.Now that that's out of the way\, I will start my review.Story - Right of the bat horizion zero dawn does one hell of a first impression from ripping out a scene of Jurassic park in that you see these amazing machines for the first time. You are with the outsider that raises you and trains you how to survive in the wild because he was told to do so by the elders. Aloy eventually starts asking questions like why is she also an outsider and who are my parents? kind of thing. So her mentor tells her to take this trial to become a brave that she can get her answers... from there on she goes to train for this trial for years until she is finally an adult and that's were the story really starts. So from there you just have to play the game.Gameplay - Your primary weapon is the bow and arrow\, latter on the game you get different kinds of arrows like fire arrows or shock arrows.. etc. there is also different weapons like the shock trapper or that sling shot that throws bombs. The AI is only smart if you put it into a decent difficulty setting\, granted yes even on easy mode they can still see your traps and actually try to avoid them unless you put them on one of their highlighted paths. Now that's just another thing\, the visor. Your character picks up this weird ear piece and she can see all sorts of data from it. She can use it for audio logs or use it for looking at a robots weakness\, and later in the game she uses it for controlling the robots. All 30 or so robots in the game each have their own attacks\, to some that I didn't know they had when I first killed it. The bigger robots pose more of a challenge in the game\, were as the smaller ones can usually be killed in one shot. Though the side quests I feel like could have used more narrative like the witcher series. This games crafting is ripped straight from far cry\, so if you ever played any of the far cry games... you should know exactly what I'm talking about. Trust me its harder than it looks to take down some of these machines even if you do know their weakness.Graphics - I was pretty shocked that it looked really amazing for an open world game... all the different kind of robots are kind of majestic to look at. Facial animations are not that bad but they are not that special either. The world itself just looks really nice and every area you go into doesn't feel like a copy-paste job either... feels like an actual game world.Sound-Music-Voice-The sound all works like it should\, from you firing and arrow to a metal machine to just hearing the machines themselves. Very good sound design. Music is also really good and first the mood perfectly for every situation unlike in games like final fantasy 15 were the soundtrack was a bit mixed... Voice acting is great for the main characters\, but just OK for the side ones. Though they could have been better to be honest with you but its OK for what its trying to do here.technical stuff -There is acualy an imagine thing that you can change to if you want the graphics more upscalled and the FPS will drop a bit or if you want the graphics to be downscaled a bit and your FPS will rise... I just find that a really good addition in this day and age. For the most part though the FPS never really drops bellow 30\, there is no real lag issues.Bugs/Glitches -Honestly? I haven't really run into any\, but it IS an open world game so developers can tend to overlook some areas in the game that do have bugs and glitches.... I can say for certain that none of these are game breaking here.Overall -This is just one of the most original open world games that I have played in a while... at least since the last guardian from last year. I mean who doesn't love to see a T-Rex type machine with rockets on the side and a laser canon? this game is just too awesome.

87155,Horizon1,2018-11-16,5,"Bowww? Awww. Six year old Aloy is so cute! Still\, I would've preferred another Killzone. I like the premise of Horizon Zero Dawn\, namely the post-apocalyptic setting and robotic beasts\, but I feel the execution is\, well\, meh - to put it bluntly. I was bored by this game and very early on. Based on the number of positive reviews\, it's evident that plenty of gamers have found value in this title. But\, I can't enjoy a game where the majority of time is spent either conversating or harvesting - both being necessities. The story unfolds across hours of tiresome dialogue\, which means that conversations can't really be skipped. Harvesting\, on the other hand\, is unavoidable. You will need to harvest continuously in order to heal and forge ammo\, among other things. It is for these reasons that I couldn't complete the campaign.A lot has already been said of the positive attributes of this game. However\, I feel prospective players need also be made aware of the negative attributes - aside from the aforementioned necessities - which may or may not have gotten sufficient coverage.- Before playing\, I read that this game has an underlying feminist agenda. While I personally wouldn't go to that extreme\, I can see how some would describe it as such. That's because the only 'real' men are the bad or semi-bad guys. The good guys consist almost entirely of watered down versions of 'real' men\, if not the polar opposite. Aloy's dad being one of the few exceptions\, despite the fact that he's an outcast and hence considered a bad guy by the local [matriarchal] community.- There is an unrealistic overabundance of random critters sprinkled all over the place. You can't take two steps without bumping into a boar\, tripping on a turkey\, rubbing against a rabbit\, falling across a fox or running over a racoon. They might as well be holding signs saying \""Harvest me! C'man! I'm here! Do it now!\"".- There is an unrealistic underabundance of NPC models. This might not seem obvious right away\, but you'll soon notice things such as the fact that Cren is just Teb with a beard and some lip injections. Or\, that Mother's Heart village appears to contain an unusual number of identical siblings. Most other open world games also feature duplicates and doppelgangers\, but they seem to be more noticeable here - for whatever reason.- For an open world game\, the map is relatively small - even by pre-Assassin's Creed Origins standards. NPCs often speak of locations or events as though they exist or occured many miles away\, when in reality they're only a couple hundred yards down the road. I do\, however\, appreciate that it's actually open world and not deceptively such\, as in the Tomb Raider reboot series (of which this game reminds me A LOT).- Machines do not venture outside of their specified boundaries. And\, because the map is so small\, these boundaries can be unrealistically tight. This is most obvious with the largest of machines\, which really just move around in circles or back and forth.- Mounts. They suck. The mechanics are so clunky\, I'd rather run.- Weapons. They mostly suck. I found the Tripcaster to be the most fun and useful bow\, except when machines sometimes charge through its trip cables and nothing happens. The Hunter bow does little damage unless you're eyeshotting raptor-like machines called Watchers\, and its use is unsatisfying. The Sharpshot bow\, which deals more damage\, is an utter chore to use due to its low firing rate.- Gameplay graphics. They're good\, but are they earth shatteringly so? No. Cutscene and dialogue sequences feature graphics similar to what you'd expect from the Mass Effect series\, no doubt. However\, the gameplay graphics are like those of any other modern\, decent title. I wouldn't normally list this as a negative\, although considering the hype I expected better.All in all\, Horizon Zero Dawn feels like a demo\, an unfinished or glorified indie product. Guerilla Games\, you've had your fun. May we now get our beloved Killzone back? Please.… Expand",true

87163,Horizon1,2017-03-10,9,"This review contains information on missing things you would expect in video games today.1. StoryThe Story is cliche but enjoyable unless you decide to pick up all the collectable items which is something most people I presume would do after the story's end\, however making a map of these objects and giving it to players will make them go out of there way to pick them up.   Its a way of extending game play perhaps or giving the player more to do which is in a way welcome but the maps shouldn't be sold till the end of the game\, I feel it was a bad design choice and if you making maps for this why didn't you make maps for the lore logs for completion?Story Spolier!\, plot hole in writing? :(\""its nice that human knowledge was supposedly destroyed so they have no need to explain certain aspects until a sequel is made\""). - But if knowledge was gotten rid of why did Hades and Gaia still have this knowledge??? I suppose this can only be explained by the letter saying about the lost in space alpha program.  I am just pointing out it may be a plot hole as the knowledge to create a human\, the knowledge to construct new robots would also surely be apart of the knowledge destroyed.----------------Story length?Without the side quests/ errands the main story is actually short (10-12 hours maybe). (The story is enjoyable I am just pointing out the collectables can slow the pace of the story to a grind if you pick them all up before continuing on quest.I don't feel my choices impacted the story that much. However i did feel something when rosh and aloy parted before the trial the words used was a great moment.The story is great for people who like tech lingo (me)\,  and the story does stand out\, the dramatic cut scenes are great and its nice to see cut scenes are changed by your still lingering traps in the foreground. The ending credits is a nice way to display peoples names who worked on the game.Game PlayI have a beef with the staff okay you can do some great sneak attack damage and override stuff with it but it doesn't have much purpose in close combat as its just more useful to range everything with bows and trip wires\, and i don't think there is a block or counter move to melee attacks from humans.  I would have expended a bit more variation in weapon attacks on the spear as you have it all game\, and i would have expected different types of spears with a few different animations as i feel the spear is under powered and watching the same animation over and over is not satisfying if the spear doesn't do enough damage to an altered enemy to kill it.  The slingshot is not that helpful either in my opinion not when you have trip wires that can be placed in any number (a good thing) on points across the map (having them all deal damage you expect through is another thing most likely it was built in to stop cheesing (a good thing) from doing all the damage and finishing battles instantly (I like my 360 damage per trip mine thanks(manly explosive and fire types (certain types where not really worth using).Upgrading with crafting needs goose\, boars\, fish and rabbits\, fox's and racoons... was time used so i could carry a lot of stuff most of it was actually useless for quests through e.g carrying hearts to trade in for quests or carrying rare items cause i could trade them with merchants there was no real need to. It was a tad much.The quest log when showing the map should incorporate the maps features not force the player to go to a different toggle page in order to fast travel.I did encounter a game breaking glitch at Mother's watch. If you return there after the main quest when you should be leaving the starting area for the first time you can get trapped behind a gate cause the gate closes behind you.  I also encountered a single object underneath the map when on the mountain pass a health item which I would have liked to have gotten oh well.I found it annoying you couldn't buy items in bulk but could sell in bulk meaning you had to use x to buy a lot of potions rather than 2-5 button presses you had to use like 20.The graphics are great\, but the a certain hard to get armour cough (5 powercells) looks bad after getting it or may irritate some people as its flashes quite often. you will understand what i mean after getting it.I may have been over critical of the game its a great game that's is worth purchasing\, Its sound is great\, the combat is great not to hard or easy and does require planning on higher difficulties but I played on normal. Its an essential purchase for owners of the ps4.… Expand",true

The story line itself is interesting\, full of lore\, and a little confusing\, but it really is a small gripe\, because all is forgiven every time you engage the mechanical beasts. The combat is where HZD shines.  There are so many ways to approach an encounter\, and they're all incredibly rewarding when you succeed.  Fighting the mechanical foes truly never gets old. Every fight is unique\, and fun.  Using the main character's scanning device\, you can detect different weaknesses on the robots\, and check out important items in your vicinity.  Resources you've collected can be used to craft potions and other things you'll need while making your way through the incredibly varied landscapes that are found in the large map.  Aloy\, the main protagonist can be upgraded over time too\, making her much stronger\, but definitely not invincible by any means.

Nora reminds me of mesolithic european cultures and Banuk a paleolithic deer hunters (madeleine culture?). Oseram are more Tolkien influenced \""standard dwarf race\"" of scotish highlanders. Beauty of this game is that it was advertised as prehistoric dinorobo hunt sim\, but after first act you go on open world RPG adventure\, where different cultures clash. After seeing Nora villages\, Carja forts and cities makes your jaw drop (and again after getting to Meridian\, which looks insane!).Every robot you encounter feels like a boss on it's own right. Even small watcher have it's own set of attacks\, patterns\, hardpoints. At the end of the game\, when you start one shot entire packs of smaller enemies\, you will get a sense of achievement. You will also create your own playstyle (mine is tear arrows + elemental arrows).Good job GG. I'm not giving you 10/10\, because no game is perfect. Only scams get 10/10.… Expand",true

I'm about halfway through it and it is a large enough game; you'll get your moneys' worth\, lets put it that way. It looks amazing\, visually\, and sets a pretty cool benchmark for future games of the sort.I was super excited for it since the Robot combat is super fun and pretty satisfying but if you expected a groundbreaking and deep story like Witcher 3 or Last Of Us\, like me you will be disappointed. That's a high bar\, I know\, but it still seems silly that people are gushing over it like it's an amazing story because it does LOOK nice\, that does not fix how terrible most of the acting is and the boring story that doesn't really reveal any interesting motivations for any other characters at all.Sure it's a video game\, and probably powerful if you're between 12-18\, but most mature adults will find the story elements pretty laughable. Basically we're in a distant future (1000 years? Really?). There are massive steel robot dinosaurs roaming the lands and it looks like human-kind has devolved into complete idiots\, maybe because the last survivors were a couple burnt out hippie kids at a music festival that had to repopulate earth. Somehow these idiots mixed in with these nimble robo-dinos are still surviving by fire and spear\, and employing ridiculous social rules that involve casting out anyone who sneezes the wrong way to live alone and not talk to anyone like it's a society of middle school girls.The protagonist is a nice idea and a step in SOME direction but not sure what. She and all of the characters and story come off as a parody of safe \""liberal\"" storytelling while missing the point of what a nuanced and progressive story would do.  It's like someone studied the approach of Naughty Dog and tried to copy it directly without thinking about why.It's almost offensive by trying so hard not to be offensive and screwing up the story because of it. (See Witcher 3 for the right way to do this.). The world is beautiful but the design of it doesn't seem to be motivated by any particular history\, stories or encounters in the game you're playing. It starts to feel empty pretty fast. If you took say witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 and just mashed them together roughly\, you'd have HZD. It controls smoothly\, but that doesn't matter. The battles are easy enough to not really need most of the cool gadgets that are thrown at you immediately. The HUD feels a little cluttered and no mini-map which gets frustrating.I go on for a while since there are as many \""wow\"" moments as there are \""really?! that's the dumbest thing ever..\"" but suffice to say it's a fun enough game that I'll forget about as soon as it's done. It's reminding me I need to try Zelda and re-play Witcher 3.(Also if you genuinely like the story of either Watchdogs game then you might like this one. Predictable\, corny\, adolescent stuff; but entertaining for a while.)… Expand",true

Horizon can also boast one of the best AI systems I have played\, it is clear Guerrilla put many hours of thought into the design of each of the machines which makes for a vast catalogue of different machines all with different strengths and weaknesses. But not only this\, the gameplay of the AI is brilliant\, the fact you can play this game for 30+ hours and still find it entertaining is testament to this.

It just goes to show what game developers can achieve when they are given the time and the creative freedom to create something they actually want to do\, not just rival their competitors biggest franchise. And then spend that time to really craft\, hone and perfect it.Where do I even begin with this game. Well everyone already knows the graphics\, gameplay mechanics\, world design and design of the machines is absolutely TOP NOTCH! But where Zero Dawn really shines is in its story. Not only is this one of the best story's ever presented in a video game. its one of the best stories ever told in any entertainment medium!! Its so well paced\, With all the information being gradually drip fed throughout the game with plot twists and big reveals at every turn\, the immersion in this game is something not very often experienced anywhere else.Its also very rare that a sandbox game is this addictive in this day and age. The world just begs to be explored to its very corners. All the side quests\, errands and other activities hardly feel like busy work and are soo addictive and fun\, And they all matter and can all have effects on the story line and ending.Alloy is a great protagonist\, and I cant spoil but there are some exceptional side kicks and villans throughout as well.Another gratifying feature is the sheer fact that the game makes honest effort to work as many details as possible into the story rather than just resting on the tropes of a sandbox game. For example; Why does Alloy always mutter out loud to herself .. Is it because its a video game and she's trying to give the player hints ? .... Noooope there's a story reason behind it. Why is this smallish landscape such an ethnically diverse place? Because its a video game and it has to be PC... NOOOOOOPE there's a story reason\, Or why are the environments so rich in diversity and climate even for a repetitively small space? Because its a videogame and the sandbox cant be repetitive and boring? \,\,\,\, NOOOPE there's a story reason for that too. So on and so forthUnfortunately though some of the games imperfections that others have spoken of are true also. Whilst Alloy is a great main character as Sylens\, Avaid\, Varl\, Herries are aswell\, there are a few side characters that are a little annoying and there's a fair bit of misplaced voice acting here and there too. For example a large dreaded African looking man with a voice like he's a white computer nerd with Satyriasis... COME ON. And yes the facial animations and lip sinking at times is off and as sort of explained earlier the voice acting is relatively hit and miss. But all the main characters with important roles are generally done pretty well.In conclusion I cant give Zero Dawn enough praise. Its minor flaws are hardly gamebreakers and at times only serve to make the game more entertaining. It is easily the game of 2017\, Its the best current gen game to come out since The WItcher 3 and it even trumps Uncharted 4 as the best PS4 exclusive thus far... Horizon Zero Dawn is one we will be talking about for years to come.… Expand",true

I love this sort of combat system and how the focus allows me to pinpoint certain weaknesses to give Aloy a bit of an advantage going into a tough fight\, although the track highlighting is making it a bit too easy\, I have to say. But I was moving along and completing quests without looking back.Then I just hit a wall\, I found myself wondering why every side quest was identical to the other\, why the facial animations were absolutely awful\, why the characters all seemed to look the same and have no motivations\, why the human enemies became so boring to fight\, why the enemy machines acted like braindead zombies with tripwires and traps\, why I’m rambling to myself like a psychopath... It was because the game just got utterly repetitive and boring. The story slowed down and I had no idea why these certain characters were even part of the main quest line\, the side missions were all way too similar\, the hunter lodge trials got buggy and became more of a chore\, and for whatever reason I was outputting so much damage and unable to sustain a minor slap from a grazer? Balance\, anyone?The game did not implement enough new and exciting twists and turns or armor/weapons to upgrade and collect\, and I just found myself sneaking around in tall grass\, sneak attacking everything when the enemies should clearly see me. Reminded me of The Last of Us stealth mechanics\, utterly broken and immersion breaking. I just hit a point where I no longer cared about any of the characters and it became a chore to finish the game.+ Absolutely gorgeous and large open world+ Lots of side activities+ Good variation of enemies+ Challenging combat on higher difficulties+ Good skill set system+ Great enemy designs (machines)- Nonsensical stealth system and poor AI- Abysmally written characters- Abhorrent facial animations & lip-syncing issues- Repetitive side quests- Awkward camera angles during combat- Story got a bit boring towards the endOverall\, Horizon is a fun game\, for a certain period of time\, but it gets bogged down by repetitive quests\, boring story and characters\, lack of new gameplay elements through progression\, and awful AI and animations. I have no doubt that if they make a sequel\, and rectify these issues\, it would definitely merit a score of 80 and up\, but as it stands now\, I can’t bring myself past a 60. It is sad because I really enjoyed the scenery and the design of all the machine monsters\, hope they do better in a potential sequel.… Expand",true

If you like scripted gameplay\, or simple gameplay\, without the ability to choose how to play\, this game is not for you.I started it on Very Hard because the game allows it. So every whining about how this game is easy and how quest are just errands\, goes out the window. Because this whining comes form people\, who play games for the story\, on easy settings\, because they are too lazy to actually go read a fantasy book. So\, lazy noobs\, give it bad scores. Whatever. On Very hard the first enemy I encountered 2-hit killed me\, before I actually got the chance to read the tutorial message\, that tells me how to dodge and draw my bow.In this game you play as a hunter\, and it really feels like it. There is a fine line between hunter and hunted\, and you can feel it during the gameplay. One wrong sprint through a herd of seemingly docile \""dinosaur machine herbivores\""\, and you just might get respawned at your last save. While downing something like the Thunderjaw (giant T-Rex that shoots rapid lasers\, sky rocket barrages and laser rays\, when you get out of its mauling range) just feels satisfying\, a great thrill and an achievement.World is so finely crafted\, that I want to enter my TV\, have an amnesia\, and never look back. And live in this Jurassic Park. I thought having only one option for playable character (in and open world game) would get in the way of my immersion\, It didnt. While during gameplay with Aloy\, tbh I dont feel 100% synchronized with her\, on character\, on decision level\, because shes nice sometimes\, and Im\, well... uhm... more practical in relations. But overall\, her character is really well developed.This game is amazing. Ive never liked a game so much since Warband! I can play Horizon for hours and hours without even making significant game progress. Its that awesome. I can just go for a hike\, to get a semi-useless collectible\, hide in the bushes during a rainstorm\, and just Rambo any pig and turkey that had the bad luck to be in the area. And make potions from their meat. Before I actually take what i went for. I also like to to that in sunny weather. I like to kill dinosaur robots and take their intensities. I like the danger\, that they can also take my intensities. But again\, Im playing it on Very Hard\, the way its ment to be played\, unlike story mode noobs who are only in to for the cutscenes (which are great btw) and \""complete\"" the game. This game is not about completion. It about the experiences\, the senses\, the mind. You vs mother nature.You hunt and you craft\, so you can hunt more. The world is immersive\, it looks and feels better than real life. Ive wasted hours in photo mode alone\, to make wallpapers. Game does what it says\, and does it well. If you are intelligent\, the game will let you be. If something is tough\, you can try a different approach. Another angle\, another cover\, another weapon...This will probably be the best PS4 game\, if God of War doesnt turn out to be better. And Im really glad they made it exclusive\, because what this developer dedicated\, would not have been possible\, if it was on other platforms. And Im not a fanboy. I have a PC\, on which I dont play often anymore\, because of all the online cry kids\, and I dont feel like babysitting and encouraging anyone anymore\, in order to play normally\, so I went single player only. And additionally Ill get a Switch when they fix it. So I cant say Im just a biased Sony fan. But what Guerilla did was right\, no matter if Sony owns them or not. This developer has my support well-earned. Damn.. when I killed my first T-jaw with 10 hp left\, no herbs\, no potions\, or meat to craft them\, I went on the balcony and shouted at the world...Horizon is not like the Witcher\, or Assassins Creed\, or any other game.  The game borrows a lot of the best defining concepts from many different games. Melts them\, and forges them in its own unique style. So its not truly unique\, nothing in our digital age is unique anymore\, but still\, for its time\, for our time\, its pretty unique and interesting. Hope they make a sequel!!!

Notice how many of them were given by users who have only reviewed 2 games in total: Breath of the Wild (spoiler alert - they gave it 10/10) and Zero Dawn (which gets 0/10\, what a surprise). These children are a perfect example of why nobody takes Nintendo fans seriously anymore and they're only here to throw a temper tantrum. Their actions further prove that not even these fanboys themselves believe in the product they claim to love. In their mind\, BotW can only be the best if they cheat and downvote any other game out there\, not because it's genuinely good. Let that sink in: Nintendo fanboys don't think a Legend of Zelda game is good enough to make it on its own. It's absolutely laughable.I finished the game with a platinum trophy last night and it's absolutely fantastic! It borrows elements from many great games and mixes them together. The open world is like a mix of Skyrim/Fallout/Far Cry Primal while the gameplay is a Tomb Raider/Uncharted/Assassin's Creed hybrid. It's not revolutionary\, but what it does is well executed and polished. It's all the more impressive seeing how it's a brand new IP from a developer who's mostly known for the not-so-good Killzone franchise.I was quite impressed with how fleshed out the characters were. Both the main protagonist Aloy and her father figure Rost are likeable from the very beginning even if you don't know much about them at first. This is the kind of character development the new Tomb Raider games wish they had yet they failed miserably at.The story itself is not very original. It's the classic old trope of evil robots going rogue and destroying humanity. It's been done many\, many times before but the game's universe still feels quite unique thanks to the mix of science fiction and fantasy elements. The result is a beautifully crafted\, vibrant world that's fun to explore. Great sound design\, subtle music and excellent voice acting are just a cherry on top. The game is pretty long too\, so you definitely won't finish it in a few hours.If I have any complaints\, it's the AI. It's dumb. Like really\, really dumb\, even on higher difficulties. Sure\, the enemies can kill you in one or two hits\, but it's very easy to lose them once they start chasing you. There's also no evasion system like World of Warcraft has\, meaning that you can just stand on top of a cliff or a building and shoot enemies who are helplessly running below you unable to hit you. Sure\, they avoid traps (which is a great source of irritation) and they always seem to magically know where the tripwires are\, but they are absolutely stupid in every other way.Oh\, and while the game is very polished\, I have encountered one strange bug; during the final battle I somehow got stuck in the ground and being unable to move\, I got promptly killed by the boss (who was at 50% health at that point). I had no other issues during my entire playthrough\, though\, no framerate drops or crashes.Despite minor complaints\, Zero Dawn is still an absolute must buy and one of the best games of this console generation. It also gets bonus points for being singleplayer only and not shoehorning a half-baked multiplayer mode in. Normally I'd give it a 9/10\, but seeing how so many envious losers are trying to metabomb it\, I'll give it a full 10.… Expand",true

When Horizon first debuted I immediately latched onto the concept. A stone aged tribal society living in the ruins of a post apocalyptic world of the distant future is a concept that just hasn't been explored. Guerrilla Games' first venture into the realm of the RPG is a wondrous success.Outside of the concept behind Horizon\, the game is hardly original. Guerrilla has borrowed pages from Bioware's ability to create memorable characters and dialogue\, and CD Project Red's ability to create sharp and meaningful gameplay mechanics and gorgeous believable worlds\, and Guerrilla executes this things almost flawlessly. The characters in Horizon are absolutely memorable\, and the world may be the most beautiful open world to be seen on a PS4 yet. The core mechanics of the game are sharp and defined\, but also very organic. The story is meaningful\, even emotional in some ways\, and the soundtrack to back it up is spot on\, a shoe in for best original score for 2017.Horizon: Zero Dawn has some tough competition among PS4 exclusive titles. Having to contend with the likes of Naughty Dog's Uncharted 4\, and From Software's Bloodborne is no easy task. However\, considering that Horizon: Zero Dawn is Guerrilla Game's first foray into role playing games\, even rating it among the top contenders is extremely impressive. Would I go as far as to say that Horizon is the single best PS4 exclusive to date? No I would not\, however I believe this game is deserving of a top three spot\, no questions asked.

None waste your time... they all give you a new piece to the mystery of this world and your origin…But after a wow moment half way through the game that opens your eyes to the setting and the story and the possibilities… the charm of the game and its open world starts to fade…The world is beautiful and tons of time went into crafting it… every slice of land feels it was placed with purpose… but I never felt an urge to explore the lands…The biggest mistake I feel this game makes is a lack of loot or weapon upgrades….You can only get better weapons and outfits by trading machine parts and shards to merchants..the problem with this is you have to make a mental note and then you have to travel to a merchant and trade rather than have an arsenal of weapons with a list of materials like far cry primal did so well and upgrade them in menu like you can your pouches…Which are a little better at upgrading\, but not quite perfect as it never alerts you when an upgrade is available…Not every animal has skin or bones in them.. Weird... I know... but these are uncommon and rare items… so even if you do hunt 100 foxes you aren’t guaranteed to get the items you need for your upgrade so by time you get them you forget if it was the bones you needed or the skin…But again all of those could’ve been thrown out if you were able to just find better weapons in the world…It would give incentive to explore and do the errands and side missions…Because of a lack of upgrades or loot system I had 0 interest in helping any of the characters in the game.. They weren’t interesting... and they shunned me most of my life… why help them?For experience? For trophy progress? That’s all any of the open world felt like…And considering there’s a missable trophy here that demands you make certain choices instead of just playing the game you want.. These trophy progress tasks just aren’t worth it if you aren’t in desperate need to be more powerful during battles…which could definitely be possible as the enemies here are no joke…You’ll find yourself using berries and potions like crazy if you don’t learn to roll out of the way and time attacks... especially if its more than 2 on 1…You can even the odds by overriding enemies so they’ll fight for you\, and you can even ride them to make traveling around the world a little easier as you work towards finding fires to fast travel…I know this review sounds a bit negative\, but that’s only because this style of game is my style of game.. I love it the most so I’m the most critical of it…Sure\, Horizon Zero Dawn is just a map cleaner\,But its map cleaning isn’t what makes this map cleaner so greatIt’s the tense moments you face around every cornerIt’s the care you have for Aloy\, it’s the searching for answers.The combat\, the story telling\, the beautiful world.This is what makes Horizon Zero Dawn a must play.A continuation of what we get here with a few tweaks to how we get better weapons and outfits and a sprinkle of exploration incentive in the sequel...And Horizon 2 will no doubt in my mind be a masterpiece...I give Horizon Zero Dawna 9/10… Expand",true

While there are collectibles and a few side tasks they should not be at the forefront of your concern when considering this game.Aloy is a great example of exactly how to make a female lead right. Her sex is not the forefront of her character\, but a small influence behind her culture\, and upbringing. Simply put\, she is a strong\, mostly self assured woman who can stand on her own and doesn't feel the need to scream about it.I immensely enjoyed this titles story\, and most of its game play elements. How combat works remains quite constant throughout the game\, and the new tools of how you approach it are acquired early on. What presents challenges are the increasingly more complex and dangerous machines you will combat\, with a total of 25 units in the game\, (Though a few are nearly identical save a cosmetic or elemental difference.) Combat difficulty will depend on your skill and gear. While I don't think it's impossible to take out some of the most difficult enemies without certain ammo types- it will feel like a brick wall without them. That only adheres to how long your battles would take\, staying alive is a matter of skill\, timing and preparation.As stated before the story is the star\, and this goes the same for side quests and errands. Mechanically\, they all encompass much of the same elements. Aloy is asked for help\, Aloy uses her special tool to guide her to the solution\, Aloy combats an enemy force and then reaches its conclusion after a chain of these events. The stories behind these side quests are a redeeming factor\, but gameplay wise I feel it could have done with more variety.The dependency on her tool in these and main quests is my main issue with this game. While the narrative of it allowing her to interact with the world in ways others around her cannot is understandable\, there are certain points where this simply wasn't needed. Tracking an NPC *Always* involves using this device\, and that's where it feels the most tedious.In my play through I experienced only 1 crash after a fast travel and barely a handful of graphical glitches that the game fixed after a few moments for me to look and laugh at it. For how impressive a beast of this is even on a regular PS4\, it runs very very well.Overall I will say that this game is worthy of its console exclusivity status and is sure to be a proud poster child for this generation of Playstation.… Expand",true

The combat is NOT slow paced\, unless you play stealth and only use the bow. You see\, one of the interesting things about the game is that you get five or so weapons to fight with. Two types of bow\, fast and strong\, as well as a bomb tossing slingshot\, tripwires that explode\, and a harpoon that holds enemies down. Generally late game combat consists of you slapping on your high powered explosive slingshot and unleashing a volley of flaming destruction that only the two toughest enemies in the game could survive.Between combat you'll be looting enemies\, human and machine\, for materials and upgrades\, using your own form of \""detective vision\"" to follow trails for quests\, and have chats with people with useless dialog options. There's really only a handful of quests that matter in the game\, and they're tied to special NPCs and relatively easy to find when you think about it. Completing these is only important for a single trophy\, but the character stories are fairly interesting so it's worth doing it for the sake of those alone.Speaking of stories\, HZD takes place in some kind of apocalyptic future (Not a spoiler\, it was in trailers and the first five minutes of the game) but it's so far into the future that no one remembers an apocalypse\, there's hundred foot tall trees growing out of old skyscrapers\, and humans are acting like it's the BC era. Aloy is an abandoned girl\, shunned by her native American esque tribe for an unknown reason. She is raised by an outcast that tells her if she can become a Brave (special tribe warriors) the elders of the tribe will answer any question she asks them\, like where she came from. From there Aloy goes on a quest to stop some great corruption that's turning once docile machines into overpowered killing ... machines... and leaving some kind of dark goo everywhere it goes. And her quest just happens to tie into what happened to the ancient people that mysteriously vanished.Now\, here's where the negative reviews are getting their \""feminist agenda\"" nonsense from\, and it's because they missed history class. See\, a lot of Native American tribes were pretty matriarchal\, that is the women held a good deal of power. The Nora\, HZD's Native Americans\, are like that too. Combined with Aloy being a girl who has a couple of moments that are a bit too smart for any protagonist (Though the big twist of the game might explain that away\, depending on how you feel about genetics and how much having smart parents affects a child's IQ) and of course raging males used to seeing a muscle man smash everyone's brains in feel small when the tiny girl knows the Earth is round. These reviews aren't worth paying attention to. Aloy has some problems\, but she's relatively well developed compared to a lot of games like this (Notably\, she has better character than Far Cry 3's protagonist who's just a rich **** that start killing people and never has the appropriate psychological trauma that would cause because viddy games).The worst sin of HZD are these little choices in the dialog that do... nothing. They affect how Aloy reacts in that moment and mean nothing afterwards. Maybe if there's a sequel the game will remember the choices you make\, but right now they don't do anything at all other than give shallow replay value to see what changes if you hit the boy with a rock rather than not hit him with a rock. (He's still a dick later no matter which you pick! Surprise\, it changes nothing\, just like a Telltale game.)Overall\, while the characters are average at best\, the story is really interesting\, and the gameplay is fun. You can be tactical\, set up traps and lure machines into them\, or jump out and go mad throwing bombs and shooting arrows everywhere\, both are viable. Graphically the game's beautiful\, and none of the collectibles people complain about are necessary\, as a collectible should be. Too many games lock powerups behind out of the way nonsense. I got the platinum for this game in about 60 hours\, and that's a pretty perfect play time for a game this big\, and it was worth every minute.… Expand",true

87333,Horizon1,2017-03-11,7,"I'm opening my review with a disclaimer. I'm a hardcore PC gamer who plays console games on the side\, so take my review with a grain of salt. Onward...Overall\, I'm very impressed with the game. To me\, this feels like Skyrim (or maybe Assassin's Creed) meets Witcher 3 meets Rise of the Tomb Raider. You can definitely see elements where Guerrilla took things from each game (similar stealth mechanics\, following trails and character building). The story itself is decent. You follow Aloy as she grows from a young girl into a young adult\, who bent on winning The Proving and no longer being shunned by her tribe as an outcast. Things take a turn for the worst and Aloy ends up getting more than she bargained for. She becomes part of a larger picture.The combat feels pretty fluid and works well with the controller. Enemy motions do become predictable after awhile and it becomes easy to time your attacks and dodges. The combat difficulty fits well with each difficulty level. Aloy has a variety of weapons to choose from and they're easy to change on the fly. As far as I can tell thus far\, each weapon has at least two ammo types\, both of which you can craft at any time once you purchase a weapon that uses them.The world itself feels somewhat barren in terms of interactivity (bear in mind I'm only 20 hours in) but there are plenty of quests to do. These can be anything such as your typical fetch quests\, go kill this\, save so-and-so\, etc. You do have the option to turn the quest markers off to add to difficulty and exploration (yay for old school gamers!).In terms of looks\, I don't own a 4K TV or PS4 Pro\, so I'm stuck playing this game at 1080p\, and coming from higher resolutions on my PC\, the quality takes a hit - to my eyes. I imagine this game looks great with the 4K upscaling. Overall\, it's still not bad to look at. Your mileage may vary. The 60FPS is nice\, but I definitely could use more.Crafting is a staple in RPGs anymore\, and Horizon is no exception. The crafting is very well done and you will always have enough resources at your disposal to make most crafting bearable\, avoiding a grindfest. You might need to spend time hunting wildlife for certain parts for your upgrades to satchels\, but it goes quicker than it sounds. I honestly love the crafting system. The menus in the game are also very well done and pretty well organized.Character development is pretty much like ROTTR. You have three different trees to choose from\, which are based on stealth\, combat and foraging. These skills add to Aloy's utilities and combat prowess. These are things such as gathering additional herbs\, doing more melee/ranged damage\, being more stealthy\, faster healing and more. There is definitely a lot of room for different builds and this is one of my favorite aspects of the entire game.So\, you might be wondering why I gave the game a 7 if I like it so much? The reason for this is one reason only: The best weapons in the game. To earn these\, you have to do different trials at different hunting grounds and finish them in absurdly short times. While the trials themselves are neat\, I feel the times are ridiculous. I have always felt using time trials to unlock things like weapons is just lazy design. Finding secrets out in the middle of nowhere\, quest chains\, hard side missions\, big boss fights...those are the ways ultimate weapons should be unlocked. The main reason that this is so frustrating is because every time you fail to finish at the top tier\, you have to either huff it back to the quest giver or fast travel. I don't mind either overall\, but constantly failing gets repetitive and the loading times are subpar to me. I'm all for a challenge\, believe me\, but racing against the clock to me is just a tedious notion.Overall\, I'm very happy with the game. It definitely has a lot to offer both the casual and hardcore scene. You'll definitely have a lot of fun exploring\, crafting and developing Aloy in the way that you want. Combat is great\, crafting is great and the story is at least enjoyable. Personally\, I find it better than enjoyable\, but I won't go as far as to say it's anything original. I would definitely pick up this game. It'll keep you busy and satisfied for many hours to come.… Expand",true

The graphics are incredible (PS4 PRO).  4k HDR is the only way to truly enjoy this game to its full potential.  The story is deep and captivating.  I find myself getting lost in it for hours and cannot put the controller down.  Im already kind of getting depressed as I approach what seems to be the inevitable end.  It is not side quest heavy like other games of its type that I have played in the past.  The quest menu is easy to follow and concise.  The crafting and upgrade menus are also fairly easy to figure out.  Do yourself a favor and get the Tinker skill as soon as possible.  The open world is stunning visually although its not completely open with sometimes nothing but trees and a few rabbits for long distances.  I do wish\, however\,  that there  were more customizing options for both weapons and armor\,  which are both very limited.  I found myself pretty much running through the game with 2 bows and 1 outfit that I bought almost at the beginning of the game and am doing quite fine.  It would be nice if you can upgrade different elements of your outfits and weapons like in Tomb Raider.  The game is not without its flaws.  I find the control scheme a bit wonky and the jumping/climbing is sketchy at best.  The bow aiming seems to be inconsistent as well.

From sticking with linear FPS to an open world RPG\, you would not think this is their first open world game. The rich graphics of utilizing every ounce of the PS4 power is revolutionary. It is well optimized and so beautiful and crisp. I have gotten lost at the different environments of this game because it just sinks you in.Now for the story. The story is very interesting. It does a great job of making you want to know what happened with the world before the machines revolted and the connection with everything that happens to Aloy. It's definitely intriguing. It isn't bland\, and starts a little slow for the first hour  but it definitely picks up. With the adventure of constantly finding something new\, and how this mystery starts to come together\, it is hard to believe why such negative reviews popped up on the user critic board. Then again\, probably fanboyism from the Xbox and PC community and just wants to bring the score down.. It isn't the most mesmerizing or dramatic story that sinks you into your feelings but it is definitely a good one and I am looking forward to the DLC.Gameplay. Gameplay in this game is where it stands out the most. AI is so intelligent\, it makes you have to think on your feet constantly\, no matter how high of a level you are. I cannot think of a game that I have played\, especially in this generation\, that has such an intelligent AI that no matter what enemy you face\, you have to be cautious of your actions. The fighting mechanism is absolutely flawless. It isn't repetitive\, you can change your styles of fighting anytime\, and of course I love the oh s*** moments where I run out of arrows and need to craft as I am getting chased down by a hoard of enemies. The bigger the enemy\, the more fun and destructive it gets.Side quest. This is where it starts to bring down the score a little bit for me. Side quest are just bland. Feels like I am doing the same thing over and over. Didn't keep me interested with each quest and I am glad this game doesn't make it mandatory for you to do them. Because if that had happened\, I would have brought the score down to a 7 easily because of how rushed and no heart at all was felt for the side quest as it was for the story and gameplay. Kind of just like eh we put this in here to just do it sort of thing. So once you complete the story\, there is no drive or really anything you like to do afterwards.A side note as I come to concluding this review\, is about the voice acting and dialogue. It was eh. Not believable. I couldn't see or feel the stress\, or love or really any emotion from the characters. It isn't the worse thing in video game history\, but I hope for the future installments\, I hope they work on this minor thing to make you more attached to the characters and really believe the feelings they are so called having. They have the right story and set up\, just needs that extra heart and soul in the acting.Overall\, this game is a fantastic stepping stone for Guerrilla Games to go forth with new installments and a bigger win for Sony for bringing yet another fantastic exclusive to their line up of games.… Expand",true

The draw distance on the open world is so bad that the world looks like a fake plastic model a lot of the time when looking into the distance.

You aren't always set upon by enemies\, forcing you to keep your wits about you to avoid blundering into an enemy. This also helps when you wander into some areas\, as you truly appreciate that this is a post apocalyptic world.-The collectibles have meaning. Vantages\, Data Entries\, and various others give a glimpse into the world as it existed before whatever happened\, while some other components hint at what brought it about. Some are pointless\, sure\, but they're there for the completionists.-The enemies\, while somewhat stupid\, are legitimate threats. With the exceptions of an enemy type or two that only run away\, even the smallest machine can kill you if you're not careful. Sure\, most smaller enemies can be dealt with\, but blunder into an ambush\, or let them get an alarm off\, and you better run.-Varying weapon types\, terrain\, and situations keep combat from getting stale. It's rare to see the same kinds of enemies in a group. Typically the 'gatherers' are accompanied by some Watchers\, or a 'hunter'\, but sometimes you'll find a lone herbivore\, lucky you! Or it wasn't alone\, and it runs back\, alerting the Watchers\, and the three big hunters with its herd- Uh oh. It's rare to encounter the same situation\, forcing you to come up with new plans on the fly.-No handholding! With the exception of the tutorial in the beginning\, this game lets you figure out stuff on your own. Sure\, you can check weaknesses in the menu\, but some are brutally hard to get at\, and you'll have to come up with a game plan on your own. Sniping? Trapping? Gung-Ho Arrows Blazing? It's all viable\, if you have the skill to do it.-Intuitive menus! Especially in Shops! Have you ever sold a rare component for good money\, only to find out later you needed it to upgrade your ammo container? Worry no more! The in shop menu tell you what each item is useful for (Crafting\, Trading\, or Selling)\, letting you know when you're clear to hock that junk.A few negative points would have to be that crafting some ammo pouches doesn't feel major\, as you can craft ammo on the fly\, but in intense combat situations\, you may not have the time\, so that's moot. The map is huge\, but with reasonable load times\, and accessible fast travel\, that's hardly an issue. The good outweighs the bad by far in this game.Which is why I am sorely concerned by troll reviews and bitter fanboys\, making accounts on this site just to badmouth a game they can't/won't play\, or just to piss people off.

The game is smooth with the frame rate a solid 30fps and there is no screen-tearing I noticed. Animations and visuals easily match\, and in my opinion\, mostly better anything that has been released this generation so far (apart from the occasional odd facial animation\, but we're not talking ME:A levels of bad).But something felt off\, like I was missing a part of the puzzle when it came to taking down these robotic menaces.Then it clicked\, once I started using the full range of toys on offer I realised the combat system is so much deeper than it seems at first. Fights\, particularly with the larger enemies\, became tactical affairs with me looking to gain every advantage I could. Blowing weapons off enemies to use against them\, scanning for weaknesses\, turning robo-dinos against each other and using the environment to significant effect became second nature and hugely satisfying. I then found myself completely hooked.So\, don't just use the standard bow and arrow then complain the combat is shallow. Get creative\, lay traps\, change weapons\, learn your foes weaknesses and execute plans. Then hastily change them on the fly as the games superb enemy AI throws a spanner in the works.The dynamic stealth system works effectively\, as battles with human enemies devolved from a cat and mouse affair into loud firefights with explosions aplenty\, only to turn quiet again just as quickly as I dove into cover and disappeared into dense thickets\, once again picking people off one-by-one\, First Blood style. Except with with an arguably better looking\, female\, flame-haired Rambo at my control.The story fast became much more engaging\, with early cliche-ridden moments giving way to a slow-burning\, thoughtful and complex tale which surprised me\, gripped me and drove me to discover more about the world I was inhabiting. It even managed to make me forgive a few rather heavy-handed morality lessons the game insisted on 'teaching' me.The map is at first overwhelmingly large\, but is incredibly detailed and gives the player plenty to do. And once fast travel points and the games equivalent of vehicles are unlocked\, it becomes a breeze and a joy to navigate.All in all if\, like me\, you suffer from a minor post-opening malaise\, don't be discouraged. You'll soon be rewarded by persevering with a vast\, beautiful playground with fully-fleshed out characters you'll quickly grow to love (and hate) and\, if you let yourself\, you'll find yourself totally immersed in Aloy's compelling story right to the end.As for the 0's this has on this site\, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But when you realise that opinion comes from people who haven't played this game and don't own a ps4 (which is evident by peoples review history).

After Mass Effect: Andromeda\, I was just ecstatic for a game with realistic facial animations...The writing in this game is brilliant.  The reluctant hero female protagonist is pitch-perfect.  Aloy is motivated by self-interest\, and often unabashedly exasperated and sarcastic about all the *help* everyone around her needs\, especially since she never had the help she needed coming of age.  But she warms and forms genuine relationships with those around her\, decisions that are rewarded by the game in realistic ways.  The writing is also surprising.  Often time I think I see an obvious trope only to watch it subverted by a *genuine* response.Aloy\, as a tribal huntress wandering into a world of ancient computers and machines\, is not dumbstruck\, nor does she play to the *ignorant savage* stereotype.  Her curiosity is well-reasoned.  She doesn't understand what technology does\, or how it works\, but makes obvious logical connections based on her own humanity.  In a world where others look at technology superstitiously\, she's relentless pragmatic and brilliantly adaptive.  And for all that\, she still comes across with a charming vulnerability that subtly reminds you that this is a 19 year old girl\, outcast from society\, just trying to find out who she is\, and what her place in the world is.On top of this\, the gameplay is brilliant.  I mean\, it's hard not to make hunting robot dinosaurs with a bow fun\, but the game exceeded my expectations.  The fact that your weapons gain new abilities\, but don't get more powerful\, and new outfits increase skills\, but don't offer more protection\, means that you don't have an issue with power creep as you explore.  Sure\, early machines aren't a challenge later in the game\, but only because you know how to defeat them by now\, not because your bow can now blow them away with a single shot.  Even on easy difficulty settings\, it pays to prepare the battlefield with traps whenever possible\, and if you don't use the right weapons and techniques\, late game fights will destroy you without mercy.  But for all that\, the game feels perfectly balanced.  Enemies are hard at first\, because you have to figure them out.  Once you do\, accuracy and preparation will carry you through\, but the challenge is a constant.Finally\, brilliant graphics and music design layer over the fun game play and excellent writing.  The voice acting is particularly on point\, with every character coming across as uniquely human\, and possessed of an entire life that has nothing to do with you.  The world feels large\, and full of things to explore.  Animations are a particular strong point as well.  When going up stairs\, while crouching\, Aloy will actually scamper on her hands.  Sometimes\, for no reason\, when mounting a rock\, she'll throw in a little parkour flair.  Everything moves fluidly\, and realistically\, which is important because the machines are supposed to be designed to move and feel like animals.  The artists and animators perfectly captured the juxtaposed animal grace\, and steel design of the creatures.  You can just sit and watch them go about their lives and admire them.All-in-all\, for a game I added to a list when I saw the trailer\, but never thought about again\, it's the most fun I've had playing a video game\, and experiencing a video game story\, in recent memory..… Expand",true

I just finished it after spending ever hour outside of work playing it for the last week. Yeah\, that’s right\, I got addicted.Now I know\, it’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea\, but I think that you will if you liked the comparisonSo I’ll admit right off the bat\, I had doubts that this game was going t live up to the hype. I’m glad to say I was very wrong in that my assumptions. I just finished it after spending ever hour outside of work playing it for the last week. Yeah\, that’s right\, I got addicted.Now I know\, it’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea\, but I think that you will if you liked the comparison I’ll try to draw. When I play this\, I see the marriage between Tomb Raider (first PS4 game\, haven’t tried the 2nd one yet) and Far Cry: Primal. Now throw in another game you enjoyed\, which you fight robots… and there you go. I mean\, who doesn’t like fighting\, killing or enslaving robots? Right?Okay\, so am I saying this is the best game ever? No\, far from it\, though this is a thoroughly enjoyable game. The story is well enough to keep you invested\, though predictable as… well\, I don’t know\, you think of something really predictable. ;) I will say that if you are an explorer type of player\, then you have a great deal to keep you happy. There’s plenty to explore. Even a special outfit that\, really feels like you’re cheating if you use it\, but hey… didn’t stop me. And I get the feeling it won’t stop a lot of you either. ;)Pros:- The graphics\, while not groundbreaking\, are still pretty good and the entirely open world aspect tied with the real time weather and time cycles make this a very immersive experience.- You really feel like you have to work to progress and it feels a little more rewarding when you can do the next “thing” you choose to focus on. Choose in the right order and it can make you life easier.- The number of weapons and gear you can use really changes your gameplay. You can choose from a few different ways to play it out which can increase the challenge or\, of course\, make things so much easier.Neutral:- For the most part\, the heroine\, for the most part\, seems to be one of the few sane people in this world. This can be entertaining and irritating at the same time. But I guess that’s what you get in a post-apocalyptic world?- Key story points have interactions you can choose from. I’ve yet to see if your choice actually has an impact on the story or not\, so this may add an additional dimension that helps replay value.- AI - Well\, it’s smart\, but dumb at the same time. While it seems that robots learn about traps\, they remain incredibly dumb when you silent kill one of them in front of the others.Cons:- Yes\, there are some glitches that still need to be worked out. Like the big dead robot that decided to violently twist and twitch off in to the sunset. Seriously! Okay\, fine\, no sunset\, but it really did just kept on going.- Major design flaw in that when purchasing anything\, if you want to buy more than one\, you have to buy them all individually. Not to mention you have to hold down the button to be sure you want to for about a second each time. Thing is\, they give you the ability to sell multiple\, so it just seems sloppy.- Inability to map your own controls. Sure this isn’t something that’s standard\, but for me all the way to the end\, I still used the wrong buttons my fingers have been trained to over the many years (more than I’m proud of) of gaming. Annoying in the heat of an engagement. Not a problem everyone has\, I know.All-in-all\, this is a great game. It’s totally worth buying as you will more than likely enjoy every minute of the many\, many hours you will spend on. I’m sure that there will be more than a few updates to fix bugs\, which will get rid of some of the glitches and fix the odd crashing that I experienced (only twice)\, so that’s okay. I’m looking forward to the DLC content. This is one of those instances where we actually got a full game. Thank you for that! The DLC will add to\, not finish the story.… Expand",true

Horizon: Zero Dawn does a lot of things right making it a joy to play though the entire 40+ hour game\, however there are a few things holding it back from being prefect.While I don't think this game is a 10/10 like so many people have given it\, I do think its FUN\, and i mean really fun.  If you own a PS4 I would consider this a must buy\, especially if you like open world games.  Horizon: Zero Dawn does a lot of things right making it a joy to play though the entire 40+ hour game\, however there are a few things holding it back from being prefect.Graphics(9/10):  Anyone who has seen any of the trailers or game-play footage knows that Horizon has stellar graphics.  From the environment to the metal beasts you face through out the world\, it looks amazing.  There are several moments when traveling on foot to the many diverse locations in world that you want to sit back and appreciate the view.  From walking through the woods and seeing the sunlight break through the trees to the awesome machines and there amazing attack animations and designs.  The only place where I fear the graphics fell short is the character models.  Many seem reused\, to the point that during many side missions I couldn't tell the difference between many of the characters. Some do have unique faces\, and the faces are all well done\, with intricate outfits\, hair and especially eyes\, damn those eyes look good.  Finally my biggest complaint with the graphics is while faces are nice to look at\, the facial emotions the characters express are very stiff.  They almost always have the same facial expression of boredom.  I personally think Aloy has the worst facial animation\, that rarely changes\, always with her mouth slightly open likes she constantly confused\, which she is as far as the story goes\, I just wish she had more facial expressions to help us to better understand her as a character.Sound(9/10) : Another incredibly strong point with only one thing holding it back\, so I will start with the bad.  One thing I despise in games is when the characters decide to say certain phrase either at inappropriate times or they say the phrase so much that its effect is lost\, or worst case scenario becomes annoying\, and Aloy gets a little annoying.  She will constantly say the same phrase of how she has escaped detection or how useful these herbs are at times where it makes so sense or so frequently to become frustrating.  To some this might not bother you\, but to me its lazy and all it does is ruin the experience.  Aside from that the sounds are great\, voice acting is well done\, the music takes aback seat most of the time and it  sets the mood when it needs to\, helping with the feeling of wonder or excitement.  The sound of the machines is top notch\, with head phones on the sound of combat will suck you right up in the world and make you feel like your the one in life and death fight with a metal T-rex shooting laser beams from his mouth and charging through rocks while your arrows ping off its armored plates.  They did the sound right.Story(8/10):  The main story felt compelling from start to finish. its has enough mystery and discovery throughout to keep you wanting to play the next mission.  There are numerous audio logs and journals to help you understand the story more and the helps flesh out the other characters.  I like this type of storytelling if done right\, but if you don't prefer to sit back and hear someone talk about something you cant see or read for a few minutes you might not get as much out of it as I did.  The side missions are a different affair\,  while some have interesting stories and twists some are just lazy excuses for you to go hunt machines or kill some bandits.  They were very hit and miss and none of them really blew me away .  They will suffice but there are nothing spectacular\, the big draw is the main story.Game-play(9/10):  This is what the game does best.  Even after playing for so many hours I can still have a blast when I go out into the wild to fight the several machines that are in Horizon.  Each machine has different attacks\, behaves in slightly different ways and have different strategies to beating.  You have multiple different weapons that have different uses and elemental attacks\, giving you even more options when fighting the hordes of machines and bandits.  I cannot express how much fun it is to fight the machines\, from setting up an ambush of traps and having a surprise attack to knock out the dangerous weapon on a machine before it can use it against me\, just to pick it up and use it against it and its allies.  The side missions usually devolve into: go to this location\, scan for tracks which you lead to bandits and machines you need to kill\, which seems like it might be repetitive but the combat is so good that i never minded it.  The world is dotted with collectibles\, there also hunting grounds with fun and actually helpful challenges and many other fun activities.  There are a few problems though\, fighting humans isn't nearly as fun (duh) and the stealth is pretty  average.The game has some minor flaws\, but make no mistake\, its a must buy.… Expand",true

The game demonstrates the graphical potential of the PS4 with fluid animations even with a LARGE number of articles on screen. Guerrilla's first RPG features a masterfully written story with references and metaphors to subjects like : religion\, class relations and the ideological gap between generations. Subjects that are sometimes clumsily addressed\, even in more traditional mediums. Where Horizon : Zero Dawn really shines though is in its gameplay. The main enemies encountered in the games are \""the machines\"" robotic \""animals\"" that populate the game world and the the developers managed to balance perfectly between challenging and fun. The IA of these machines makes combat stimulating and engaging. All of them having different sets of strengths and weaknesses that you can take advantage of with different weapons and equipment that can be upgraded. Thu human enemies on the other hand could have used some work but combat against humans is not the focus of the gameplay so there is little to be affected by here. The controls in Horizon are nothing short of stellar\, letting you chain all the movements at you disposal seamlessly\, running then sliding in the dirt while taking a shot at a machine's weak point and finishing with a dodge to the nearest shrub to hide from other robots that were just made aware of your presence\, all executed with one of the most fluid and responsive controls I've ever experienced outside of a fighting game. You'll find yourself trying to find the most acrobatic and cinematic way to bring down your enemies on many occasions.

Never did I feel like I was on yet another bland fetch quest\, or collectible hunt but rather yet another excuse to explore the nooks and crannies of the massive world Guerrilla has created. Even simple acts such as gathering materials as you move through the world did not feel like a prison of endless inventory management and on rails material farming but rather another task required of someone who lives in a world like Aloy's. Hunting animals for meat to make health potions\, stocking up on herbs\, and resources  felt like a privilege and an actual supplement to my enjoyment rather than another endless task in a world of obligations.The size of the world massive as it is\, also never felt overwhelming as many open world RPGs have in the past but rather like a perfectly sized\, consistently juicy and tender cut of steak with minimal fat....that was fully digestible at my own pace\, with a side helping of potatoes and greens for anyone who wasn't filled by the meat itself.

I can honestly say that there is absolutely nothing I hate or even dislike really about this game.  Horizon Zero Dawn is classified as an open world\, action RPG\, and on those things it does not disappoint.  You play as Alloy (no not like the metal) a cast out for reasons I won’t say.  Alloy is haunted by questions about the “ancient ones” and sets out on a journey to answer questions she has about her past as well as what happened to those that came a thousand years before her.  HZD’s fluid controls and even better combat mechanics make it a joy bringing down giant robotic beasts.  Although quite challenging at times HZD never oversteps its bounds.  What I mean is that the times I did die\, it was never something that wasn’t my own fault or stubbornness.  This is something I deeply admire about this game.  It’s not a cakewalk.  It’s not afraid to challenge your every move\, and it does it without being a complete troll.  The story was quite fascinating to me\, and I found myself really anxious to find out what Alloy finds out next.  Gorilla studios\, the developers that brought the Killzone series to the PlayStation\, really show what they are capable of and although I never believed Killzone to be bad games\, they just never quite clicked for me.  After playing HZD I cant help but admit to the reader how wrong I was about my perspective of Gorilla being a somewhat mid tier developer.  HZD in my humble opinion rockets Gorilla Studios to legendary status.  This game is an instant classic\, and although it shows a lot of influence from other games Gorilla has crafted the perfect mesh.  If I had to say one thing I wasn’t super impressed with would be SOME of the side missions.  It seems like they might have tried to go the Witcher 3 route.  Making each side quest a strand of a much larger thread and just as important to the lore as any story mission would. HZD just misses that mark.  I never felt like I was doing tedious filler\, but I think there were a couple that I would have loved to see expanded on.

The Decima engine shows that it's capable of being one of the best video game engines in the world. Horizon Zero Dawn is easily the best game I have ever seen. It's helped by great art direction\, but the engine brings that art to life in a breathtaking world\, and coupled with a wonderful combat system\, Horizon is a keeper.The gameplay is largely based around using your bow and various types of arrows against a variety of machines\, and that all works very well. There's a helpful mechanic which slows down time\, which you will probably need to hit the weak points on some of the faster kinds of enemies in the game. I found myself using each kind of arrow depending on the situation\, which reflects good design. I also found myself going about each kind of fight differently. I found that some enemies were easier to take on using explosive traps\, while others were better fought using raw firepower. Like the variety in ammo\, that reflects good enemy design.I will give criticism to some of the human enemies. They're just not quite as interesting to fight as the machines. It makes sense to fight them within the context of the story\, but it's not Horizon's strongest point in the gameplay department. They're easily taken out with headshots\, and they're not as fun as the monsters that prowl the rest of the world.I really enjoy post-apocalypse stories where you don't really know what happened\, and you uncover the mystery as the story goes on. Horizon does exactly that. The only thing you really know at the start is that humanity has been reduced back to a tribal state\, and there are machines out there that will attack any humans on sight. You slowly piece together the heroine's story and how she ties into what's going on with the rest of the world. The story is fun and interesting\, and you get to meet colorful characters along the way. I found most of the characters entertaining\, and they really felt like they were just trying to get by in a world that was actively trying to kill them.With the gameplay and story both being fun and enjoyable\, the only thing left is the world design. There are three unique environments\, and all of them are beautifully crafted. Snowy areas filled with hills and mountains\, deserts with mesas and canyons\, and lush jungle where many invisible predators wait. Each one is fun to explore and littered with secrets that detail the world before machines took over.Overall\, this has been one of my favorite games. Everything comes together to make a fun experience. After getting the platinum trophy\, my save file clocked in at just under 40 hours. It doesn't last too long\, but it lasts long enough to feel satisfying. You won't have a nightmarishly long game to go through\, but you won't just have a bite-sized snack of a game either. I personally recommend this to any PS4 owner. It's a truly wonderful and beautiful video game.… Expand",true

Amazement at the visuals\, the character design\, the voice acting (especially from the young girl) and the motion capture. Once the game opens up however\, everything stagnated pretty damn fast. It's easy at first glance to assume there's more to the game than meets the eye\, but the more time spent the sooner you realise that everything the game has to offer has been done else where\, bigger and better.Basic navigation and character control seem totally abstract from the world. For one\, I didn't even realise there was a \""climbing\"" mechanic\, complete with animations and contact points until I was about 20 hours in. Since you can pretty much climb any structure if you jump into it for long enough. Wildlife even roam free underwater\, and I'm talking the rabbits\, boar and the occasional turkey.Although I'm inclined to stealth\, the AI (even on hard mode) seems to be as daft as a brush. You can literally take out entire hoards of enemies from a single bush with stealth strikes\, even when they are facing you and the indicator icon reads visible. Alternatively\, hand to hand combat is something that definitely needs a bit of redesign. One weapon\, one combo and no hit stun makes for some clumsy and slightly embarrassing battles with both human and mech. Human enemies even blocking or causing damage without actually animating.The RPG elements are mostly null\, level scaling doesn't seem to exist and damage/resistance bonuses don't really mean anything in the long run either. Some XP and skill tree templates taken straight from the last Tomb Raider games. I'm around level 30 in only 6 story missions. Max level is 50 so I'm not expecting much out of it.The world does look fairly large as far as the maps representation\, but you can run on foot from one end of the map to the other in only a handful of minutes. You can see fast travels points while standing at a fast travel point and can roll your way to them with a few slaps of the circle button\, they're that close together. I haven't found a reason to use a mount besides limiting navigation with the poor horse mechanics.It functions well enough to be played and enjoyed but compared to other first party exclusives on the PS4\, it pales in comparison.… Expand",true

One migraine-inducing design is that Aloy needs a different satchel for every single item type\, and you must craft progressively larger satchels out of irrelevant materials in order to avoid inventory management annoyance. This was done the same way\, but slightly less annoyingly\, in Far Cry 3-4.- The RPG elements feel tacked on\, since\, like Far Cry 3-4\, they mostly consist of contextual actions you will use a handful of times throughout the game. Perhaps the most noticeable upgrades are the economical ones that will allow you to salvage more resources - and therefore engage in inventory management more often. None of the dialogue choices have any eventual consequence\, there is one ending to the game\, everyone's character eventually looks the same\, and your character's background is entirely handed to you. There is no roleplaying save a pastiche of some \""RPGs\"" from the past few years: dialogue wheels\, leveling and experience\, quests\, etc.- If you're outside\, the game pretty much boils down to using the extremely easy stealth system to one-hit enemies with your spear that never breaks\, or using some traps to where you can nearly one-hit larger enemies. All of these things are accessible regardless of what abilities you choose (the beckoning call\, probably the most useful ability in the entire tree\, is available instantly). Basically Witcher 3 mixed with Far Cry 3-4 but worse than either.- The story is very predictable. Just combine Enslaved: Odyssey to the West with a handful of Bioware cliches and you've about had it. The characters are extremely generic\, perhaps appropriate for a Nickelodeon cartoon. The main character is obviously inspired by Ygritte from Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones but played like a generic Jennifer Hale Commander Shepard.- The lack of risks taken is palpable\, with game mechanics borrowed from Assassin's Creed (climbing longnecks = belltowers; focus = eagle vision\, etc.)\, Far Cry 2-4 (collecting crafting materials for increasing carrying capacity and items\, clearing out bandit camps\, hunting animals for materials you shouldn't need\, stealth executions from plain sight of the exact same variety: from cover\, from below\, from above\, heavy execution\, throwing rocks to asininely backstab 3 enemies in a row without them noticing somehow)\, Witcher 1-3 (setting traps to lure larger enemies into to make up for your inherently pathetically bad damage)\, and Mass Effect 1-3 (6-option dialogue wheels that ultimately don't affect anything). Basically imagine a successful open-world franchise in the past decade and its features are probably the core mechanics of this game. Here is the list of game mechanics in this game that I have never seen before in a triple-A title:None- The music is totally forgettable. I can't even remember a single tune. There are games like Mario or Hotline Miami where you can hear the music from across the room years later and know what that was. This is not one of those games.CONCLUSION:While the game is solid from a technical and - mostly - artistic standpoint\, it is being massively overrated by critics. I'm not even a Zelda fan and I can tell the rationale for this game was to give PS4 owners some kind of kitsch Zelda open world game. It does not live up to that expectation. We have just about reached the limit of where character progression mechanics alone will carry the player retention\, and now we just need a few games to take some risks to decide what cookie cutter mechanics will be used in the next decade. This is not one of those games\, either.… Expand",true

This especially feels fair\, considering all of the fake 0 votes.  I just reported SEVEN duplicate 0 reviews\, and who knows how many 0's are written by people who aren't so lazy to cut-n-paste?I've platted and 100%ed the game.  That means that\, unlike a lot of reviewers\, I've seen all of the lore and had a lot of opportunities to put 2+2 together and figure out the more subtle aspects of the story\, not to mention recognizing a lot of the real-world mythos the author(s) drew from and the skill with which I believe they did so.  I think the story is far deeper than most people realize\, but if they don't know all of the details\, I won't fault them for thinking it's shallow and even a bit nonsensical at times.For instance\, there's all this extreme ethnic diversity that just seems like an SJW agenda\, but it turns out there's a very real and convincing reason for it.  If you don't play far enough to learn about it\, you're going to have a very different opinion about the game\, I'm sure.  But I assure you\, whether it was done as an SJW move or just part of the story and seemed to be one\, I think it won't bother you when you understand it.  And\, trust me\, such SJW moves bother ME and this DID bother me until I understood.There's also a reason why Aloy\, voice acted by the talented Ashly Burch\, seems to have a very flat affect.  You would expect better from her\, and it turns out you're right to expect better\, and indeed you got better than you realized.  You just don't realize it until you understand why from the later parts of the story.I take off that half point for two reasons.One is this business where the lore is too back-loaded and people are going to drop the game sometimes long before they understand what's really going on.  Some might never really even think about the lore enough to realize what I think makes it so good.  So that's a storytelling failure.  I don't think the story itself is flawed\, but in some respects the storytelling is.The other is the extremely-inconsistent lipsync and the far-too-subtle expression of emotions.  There are times when the lipsync and the expressions are excellent and you can tell they were capable of very good work\, but most of the time you get the distinct impression that it was just left to automation to try to sync and infer emotions\, and the results can be really dismal and immersion-breaking.Really\, though\, I feel the combat is excellent\, the story overall is excellent\, the world-building (meaning the universe\, not the physical world) is excellent\, the graphics are stunningly-well-executed\, the option to be an explorer and ignore the story is there\, and some of the characters are hilariously memorable (I give you the name \""Brin\"" and leave discovery to you).  I can't realistically honor all that with less than 9.5\, so 0.5 is all I'm willing to take off for the bits I mentioned above.As an aside\, I own all consoles and I have no allegiance to manufacturers or publishers.  I wouldn't tear down\, e.g.\, Breath of the Wild\, to make HZD seem better.  Both are great games with a few minor flaws\, and that's the worst I'd say of them.  I think people who tear down this game to do the opposite\, to make their favorite sound better\, are the cancer of game reviews\, and I hope I've justified my scoring enough not to seem like one of them.Anyway\, try it.  I hope you'll like it as I do\, because I'm very happy to have played it.  So much so that I cranked up the difficulty\, turned off the UI\, and immersed myself as well as possible for a second playthrough.… Expand",true

In this world the remnants of humanity\, having lost access to technology and knowledge from times past\, have re-organised themselves into various tribes. The player's mission is to discover what happened in the distant past\, gain the acceptance of their people\, and ultimately save the world from the robots and their masters.Just like other open world games\, there are many things to do and collectables to pick up. Complete main missions and side quests\, explore dungeons\, climb towers\, clear bandit camps\, perform errands\, collect audio logs\, pick up flowers\, craft arrows and potions\, you name it. However\, all these are part of a cohesive experience and whatever you may do at any given time\, you will rarely get bored or have a sense of fatigue (which is a problem with many other open world games).Despite the heavy gameplay borrows from other games\, Horizon's world\, lore\, storytelling and main characters are original\, if not quite spectacular and memorable as\, say\, The Last of Us. Other than Aloy\, only a few other human characters are developed well enough. The various machines however are mostly excellent and very well-animated\, ranging from the little Watchers and Scrappers\, to the mid-sized Ravagers and Longlegs\, to the fearsome Thunderjaws and Deathbringers. Fighting the robots is pretty challenging (although it's not Souls-like difficult) and thanks to the robust combat system and all the tools at your disposal (weapons\, traps\, potions) you can beat them quite easily after you learn how to fight effectively. The game's story is clearly built around the concept of fighting robotic dinosaurs in a post-apocalyptic world and not the other way around\, so (even though the developers have tried their best to come up with something great) it lacks the magic and punch of other successful story-driven game series such as Uncharted\, The Witcher\, Final Fantasy\, Mass Effect\, Metal Gear or The Last of Us.Horizon: Zero Dawn is the most beautiful game currently available on PS4\, easily surpassing Uncharted 4. The game's world is so pleasing to the eye that I don't mind walking from mission to mission instead of mounting a machine or fast traveling (which of course I do if I have to go a really long distance). Aloy's voice acting is great and the music is subtle but fitting.My only gripes with the game are these. 1st\, having to pick up flowers from the world can become a bit frustrating\, because you need to pick up a lot of them\, and this can affect the game's pace. 2nd\, the AI is somewhat inconsistent\, with human enemies feeling less intelligent and competent than the machines. For the record\, I am playing on the Hard difficulty setting\, and I have played the game through to its very end. 3rd\, most of the characters other than Aloy and Sylens are bland and uninteresting.All in all\, Horizon: Zero Dawn is a great game and a joy to play through. It's easily one of the best PS4 games out there. It's gonna receive a DLC expansion soon enough named The Frozen Wilds\, and I hope that the post-credits scene means it will get a proper sequel at some point.… Expand",true

Although the facial animations can be aI don't know what else to say other than this game is utterly fantastic.I'm going to break this review up into a few sections: Appearance\, Interactions\, Combat\, \""Feel\""\, and Story.APPEARANCE:From the get go\, you're presented with a stunning graphics and an interesting setting that makes you ask yourself\, \""Hmm\, I wonder what's going on here?\"". Although the facial animations can be a bit off sometimes (one of the few reasons why I don't give this game a perfect 10)\, the full body animations are fluid and flawless. Guerrilla Games makes excellent use of lighting and shaders to create a stunning picture no matter where you turn\, leaving you in awe at the beauty of this strange world. The machines themselves are done in a way that allows you to recognize their real life counterparts pretty quickly\, yet still admire their uniqueness.INTERACTIONS:The voice acting is phenomenal\, and more than makes up for the sometimes-wonky facial animations. You learn a little more about the world with each \""little\"" side mission and errand you do\, each of them consisting of multiple quests and incredibly deep dialogue. Horizon does a fantastic job at making quests more of an experience with the characters and the world around you rather than just a tedious task.COMBAT:Unlike most RPGs\, playing as Aloy feels incredibly intuitive and fluid. You aren't bogged down by a sluggish character with minimal movement mechanics. The movement is designed so that you're free to evade\, jump\, slide and attack without having to worry constraints such as cooldowns and stamina. Crafting can be done on the fly and time is slowed slightly so that you can still craft ammunition without having to pause the game. Each time you encounter a new enemy\, you're faced with a period of trial and error that makes you wonder \""How on earth am I going to beat this thing!?\"" My only complaint about the combat system is that it becomes relatively easy to take down machines once you figure out how to effectively destroy them. The game counters this by throwing more of them at you\, which makes for some very intense\, frantic moments of evading\, hiding\, attacking and outsmarting the AI.FEEL:Awe. Playing Horizon: Zero Dawn fills you with a sense of awe. With dozens of hours into the game I still find myself saying \""Holy ****\, what is THAT? That's amazing! (and terrifying!)\"". Very few other games have made me want to explore for the sake of just exploring. The world is both incredibly large and incredibly dense\, ensuring that you never have to travel more than a couple minutes before you encounter enemies you have to sneak by\, a new location to explore\, or NPCs to interact with. Even if you do find yourself in a large stretch of walking/riding\, the beauty of the landscape is more than enough to keep you entertained and admiring the  scenery.STORY:Horizon: Zero Dawn captivates its audience from the very get go with an atmosphere of mystery. Who is Aloy? Who is this man taking care of her? Why are they outcast? Who is this tribe? What are these machines and why are they here? What happened to the old world we're familiar with? This game does an incredible job of satisfying all of your burning questions about the characters and the world\, rewarding you for exploration and curiosity. It's always exciting to find text logs\, voice recordings and holograms that each explain bits and pieces of Horizon's backstory through individuals' experiences.The main story line itself is incredibly deep and complex\, balancing faith with science and history with legend\,  with Aloy at the centre of uncovering the truth about not only herself\, but more importantly the world.Accompanying the main story is a plethora of side quests that each have their own story to tell\, making them feel like their own \""mini story modes\"". I'm glad that they're not just an afterthought\, but an integral part of making the game what it is.CONCLUSION:HORIZON ZERO DAWN HAS MADE ITSELF ONE OF MY FAVOURITE VIDEO GAMES OF ALL TIME\, RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE LAST OF US. I FOUND MYSELF INSTANTLY FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE WORLD AND THE CHARACTERS\, MAKING THIS GAME A TRUE STORY-FOCUSED EXPERIENCE WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THE ENGAGING ASPECTS OF EXPLORATION AND ACTION.… Expand",true

I haven't gone back to do the DLC yet\, as I'm in the middle of some other games and other things\, but I played the crap out of this for months straight - only Skyrim has compared to it.Gameplay 10/10The controls on this game are impeccable. You really have to be top-notch engaged in order to not die. And yet\, while that can be frustrating from time to time\, it really is a matter of practise and skill. It's not hard because it's unfair\, it's hard because it's a challenge\, and the controls do not fight you\, they are just right.Creativity 9/10The peoples\, locations\, weapons\, enemies\, armor\, background\, and story are all really creative. They stand out as unique and exemplary in the genre.Music 9/10While also not quite a set of songs that are each specifically memorable\, all the music\, and sometimes jsut atmospheric background noise like babbling brooks\, dripping caves\, and blowing wind\, are really engaging.Visuals 10/10The visuals on this are absolutely stunning. Unsurpassed. I've never seen such a beautiful game. I often ran around the countryside just to admire the undiscovered corners of it. And to make it better\, the game gives you EXCELLENT camera control\, including nearly infinite flexibility when taking screenshots.Also\, no points taken off for sexualization. There's ZERO. No \""female armor\"" problems\, no sexed-up female characters. No tight skirts\, no naked background dancers. None of the usual crappy tropes that need to die. This game was stunningly well informed and progressive. Female characters\, not just the main one\, are fully formed human beings. And all clothing is functional and exactly what you'd make in order to survive\, period. Very\, very realistic.Characters 7/10There aren't that many characters\, but who they have are strong. Many are from a time long ago that you slowly learn about over the course of the game\, and those feel well fleshed out as well. Not the strongest part of the game\, but still well done.Plotline 9/10This was really unexpected for me the first time. It's clearly a post-apocalypse thriller\, but what the apocalypse was and how it happened and what's going on now was very creatively put together and unique. I look forward to future sequels in this world.Emotional Engagement 9/10What happens to Aloy\, and what happened to the world that slowly unpeels\, are some heavy fare. They're well done and conveyed strongly.Replayability 10/10I started replaying IMMEDIATELY upon winning this game. Even when (at the time) there was no New Game+. I liked it that much. Playing on a harder level really changes the feel of the game\, especially on Ultra Hard.Difficulty */10The game can be whatever you want it to be. On average\, the game is harder than most. I've died more on this game than on any others for a long time. But there is a difficulty setting\, and you can turn it down if you want.That being said\, replaying on a harder mode\, ESPECIALLY Ultra Hard\, is a truly new experience. Almost everything is instantly deadly on UH mode\, even with game-end stats and equipment. One reason is that on this mode\, the enemy AI is also much stronger. Things act like packs and hunt you down\, they are much harder to trap and surprise\, they're much more aggressive\, and they attack almost twice as fast\, with half as much telescoping their actions\, for twice or more damage\, and your melee spear becomes almost uselessly low damage. Also\, all ammo becomes 10-100x as expensive\, so you really have to not be wasteful\, or farm for things the hard way. It's a very different feel.… Expand",true

Speaking of which\,This game is a near-perfect masterpiece in terms of gameplay\, visuals\, and design\, and together these three factors weave an intricate\, dangerous and gorgeous world I relished exploring.Aloy is one of the best videogame protagonists in a long time - confident\, strong\, funny and emotive\, she was a true pleasure to guide around the post-post-apocalyptic landscape. Speaking of which\, Horizon is probably the best looking game I've ever played. I regularly found myself marveling at the environments\, remnant structures\, weather/lighting effects and character animations as I played through. Extra sidequests in which you collect various items from precarious positions atop snowy mountains and dramatic mesas were essential to really take in the scope and breadth of this game. The backstory of the world before Horizon's timeline is filled in with optional quests and datafiles hidden throughout the vast map in caverns\, derelict shopping malls\, jungles and deserts\, and each add a unique take on life as we know it\, long gone from the planet in Horizon. The variety involved travelling around either by foot or on one of the many equestrian-style machines is admirable. The story itself is great\, with enough twists and turns and emotion to drive you onwards to learn the truth of Earth's current circumstances. A few developments really blew me away towards the end - be ready! A highlight for me was uncovering the secrets of optional 'cauldrons'\, creepy\, mysterious factories deep under the ground from before the fall of society\, these are definitely worth going out your way to complete\, as they add a fantastic slant to the plot.Combat is absolutely fantastic and very challenging. One wrong move can put you in an extremely compromising position\, with the mechanical beasts proving incredibly violent and clever. They will gang up on you\, corner you\, unleash desperate charges and barrages of missiles or lasers\, necessitating fast reflexes and sharpshooting. Luckily Aloy has you covered. With excellent bow mechanics\, reaction time speed-altering\, decent melee and a variety of sneak attacks\, traps\, elemental weapons and even the opportunity to turn machines against each other\, you always have the tools to succeed. Death is frequent\, but always deserved\, making each battle won feel like a true achievement\, and allowing for some titanic struggles against some of the gargantuan creatures on offer. Stormbirds specifically present exhilarating and occasionally terrifying encounters.There are a few TINY issues with the game - occasionally hammy dialogue\, a limited (but acceptable) weapon/customisation\, less thrilling human battles\, and a disappointing final battle (followed by a solid story ending). None of these spoil the game in too much and | wholeheartedly award it a 10. Never have I be so stunned by a game world before - the beauty and visceral energy in it is something of a wonder\, and it truly compels you to want to explore every part of the map\, fight every  ruthless machine (beating them by the skin of your teeth)\, collect every trinket and climb every peak.Incredible game-making from Guerrilla.… Expand",true

Each mission is different\, side missions are not self-inflicted.The Dutch studio creating the feature page was very much drawn from the CD Projekt production\, only Aloy is devoid of the axle that we could blame the Witcher.

Once I expanded my arsenal and started exploring alot more\, I started becoming more and more hooked.What I love:Gorgeous open world -  It's huge and begging to be explored.Memorable landmarks.Interesting characters - great back stories and Aloy's personality is just awesome. She will most certainly be one of playstations memorable characters alongside Nathan Drake etc.Amazing graphics - just..jawdropping. On par with high end pc graphics actually.Plenty of content - So many quests to do\, collectables to find and places to discover and plenty of headshots on bandits as you take over their camps.Framerate stability - Yes thats right. A game so powerful at a stable 30 fps. Even on a standard ps4. Weather conditions may reduce it at times but nothing unplayable.Variety of enemies - each enemy (especially the machines) require a different approach and tactic to bring them down and have their weaknesses/strengths which force you to change weapons as you progress. They are not as easy as you may think\, and its so rewarding once you beat them.A broad skill tree - Choose how you want to play and what you think will benefit you the most at your current progress.What I don't love:Climbing - Times where you think you can just hoist yourself up on a ledge\, you cant. It just creates a lot of awkward jumping and depending on the area it can be frustrating to move around or even evade enemies. You can only scale cliff faces and objects that are bright yellow as an indication that you can climb it. I'm just confused why this wasn't factored in during development.Detection from enemies - I know some of them can spot you in tall grass by design\, but what annoys me is once you trigger an explosion on a machine\, they know where you are automatically eventhough you're hiding far away on a mountain shooting a fire arrow.Early game repetition - This was a big thing as it nearly ruined the game for me. After a couple of hours\, the combat and quests feel the same and the lack of weapons don't do the game justice. That is until you start unlocking things which then its a different story.The repetition part is probably the biggest impact out of the negatives. But as soon as you start discovering more\, learning what else you can do and expanding your arsenal\, it turns into one of the most incredible games you will play in a long time. Do not miss out on this game if you love all or any of the games out of Far Cry\, The Witcher\, Monster Hunter and Tomb Raider.The moment you feel its becoming the same each mission and battle\, just keep going. I felt like I needed to emphasise this. It starts off good\, gets a bit weak then progresses stronger than ever. There is plenty to do and apparently its an easy platinum trophy!Just get this game :)Final Verdict - 8.5/10… Expand",true

What a surprise!Awesome:---------------- Great character and story progression- Story has a great pacing- Some of the writing is exceptional- No Deus Ex Machina\, the story is surpassingly robust for such a weird setting- World and Story convey a real sense of mystery- Aloy is such a great\, bottom to earth main character (also great voice acting)- Open world gameplay (collectibles\, bandit camps\, towers) are not overabundant and fit well into the world- Great variety of weapons and enemies- Tactical but fluid combat- Good number of well presented quests- Great vertical level design- On highest difficulty (recommended!) many random encounters feel like epic boss battlesCould be better:------------------------- Crafting and stealth are a bit too simplified- Human enemy AI is not very smart (lure and stealth kills are op)- Variety of the world map comes at the cost of absurd climate (4 climate zones on 20km^2)- Facial animation could be better- Climbing hotspots are hard to see sometimes (also a pro\, since it doesn't break immersion)- It ends… Expand",true

The weakest part of the graphics is hair - it's a bit off-putting to see the hair not getting the same attention as the rest of the game. But this is so minor.Story: Since I haven't completed the game yet\, I can say anything about the entire story but based on what I've seen so far\, I'm super intrigued  about what is going on. I have my theories but I think the developers would have come up with something much better than my stupid ideas. The greatness of the story-development also extends to the side-quests as well. Each one I come across seems to have had a lot of thought put into it.Gameplay: I was really unsure of myself when I started. I've never been that good with bow weapons in previous games. Nor was I that good at dodge-mechanics. Both of these will become second nature to you\, the player\, quickly. Aloy is quick\, responsive and powerful. You'll find yourself starting fights with a handful of enemies knowing you're going to be a badass. There are tons of things to find and do throughout the world - it's pretty engaging.All-in-all\, I find this game to be superb. I see that a lot of people are complaining about various things. None that I've read have really delved into their complaints\, and just left it vague. I do understand that everyone has their own personal taste and what I or someone else likes isn't going to be something someone else or I like.Personally\, I love collecting things. I love exploring all the nooks and crannies for stuff. I love the enemies in this game. I love the main characters and the story is engaging to me.I highly recommend this game.… Expand",true

I spend a lot of time just switching to photo mode and exclaiming loudly at how beautiful the world\, the environment\, the lighting\, the characters\, the art design\, EVERYTHING\, looks! I thought Uncharted 4 was the pinnacle but this for me is more impressive especially since it's an open world game. Perfect score for graphics. I recommend turning off all HUD elements and notifications\, and go Naughty Dog style; clean interface. I played Dragon Age Inquisition right after Horizon just to start clearing my backlog but my God what a huge difference in graphical fidelity. It's like rubbing sand in my eyes using sandpaper. Graphics on the PS4 has definitely improved in leaps and bounds in 2017\, can't wait for Death Stranding!GAMEPLAYPlaying as Aloy is fun and challenging sometimes depending on ur playstyle. I rarely use melee\, xray mode\, tagging enemies nd instead just rely on sound and sight\, like a real hunter and it really makes the game more immersive and fun. Weapons are varied and adds a different dimension for each situation. Hunting Lodge challenges are also fun to complete\, making sure you try out every single weapon to the best of its potential. Taking down huge dinobots in the fastest time possible is always fun and never gets old. Human enemies though are annoying and too easy to kill\, and their AI could be better.ROLEPLAYING ELEMENTS AND CHOICEThis game to me is a hybrid of Tomb Raider and the Witcher 3. There's not much choice in roleplaying that will lead to multiple endings. Armor and weapons are just progressive upgrades of the same type\, and there are not much stats tinkering if ur into old school RPG a la KOTOR\, Skyrim\, Fallout etc. Modifications of weapons/armor are the only thing I feel that comes close to me tweaking around with Aloy's stats. I basically use the same loadout through the whole game until I got the best armor in game. So hopefully they improve on this in Horizon 2\, unless this is the style they're going for. An action-RPG lite hybrid\, which I don't really mind either cos its more focused and fun. A fun game is a fun game so all's good.STORYCutscenes are well done. Story is predictable to me. Nothing amazing or deeply engaging like Mafia 3\, Last of Us\, Witcher 3\, Fallout 4\, Sleeping Dogs\, Yakuza 0\, and so on. In fact\, the many text and audio logs can be disruptive to the game flow cos it slows things down at the most importune times. Its not as well done as Bioshock's audio logs where I was looking forward to collecting the next one just to hear what the heck happened in Rapture. Cos here I basically know what happened\, nothing ground breaking or plot twisting if u've watched/played post apocalypse media. Also\, sidequests are decent\, nothing as awesome as Witcher 3's but at least there are no fetch quests and kill X amount of this.All in all\, this is a game worth buying at full price\, I had Zero buyers remorse\, and wished i had bought the Collector's edition instead.TWO THUMBS UP!!… Expand",true

It's simply boring\, and you're given no reason to care about anyone in the game besides Aloy and Rost\, and one other character that is spoiler territory. This means that every side-quest you do has no real meaningful story you will care about\, nor meaningful characters.The latter half of the main story however\, is so strong in creating and describing the world around Aloy that you get to feel attatched to her\, and you gain a real understanding of how her world is being turned upside down. These parts are epic\, and impactful.Gameplay-wise\, the game is falls somewhere between good and great. The many weapons provide interesting ways of taking down enemies\, but more often than not\, I found that using just the 2 most basic weapons available would get the job done more effectively than experimenting with others. Using some of the other weapons is often a challenge\, and the pay-off for nailing a certain attack with a weapon is rarely that great.The world is massive\, and that's normally always a bad thing\, because you'll have these large empty wastelands\, devoid of anything worthwhile to do. These wastelands are also present in Horizon Zero Dawn's world\, but they are usually hidden away in the corners of the map\, serving no real purpose. It doesn't detract from the experience that they exist\, but it certainly doesn't add anything either\, to have a large area with nothing but more of the same enemies you could find elsewhere.The rewards for doing sidequests are mostly experience based\, which is great until you hit the level cap. At that point\, I stopped myself from doing any further sidequests\, because their plots were bad\, their NPC's were bad\, and now there was no useful reward in sight either.Whilst running around\, you'll find a few collectibles scattered around the world that serve no purpose besides trophies\, which is great if that's your thing (I enjoyed getting the platinum trophy)\, but the in-game rewards for getting these out-of-the-way collectibles were laughable.A last nitpick is gear-acquiring. You get the best equipment within the first 5-10 hours of playing\, because it is all purchased directly from nearly every vendor in the game. If they are going to make a sequel\, I recommend they focus more on making interesting side-characters\, making their sidequests more interesting\, and most importantly\, rewarding. Rewards could\, conveniently\, be better weaponry.Despite all of this criticism\, I must say it was a rollercoaster that ended with a thrill\, but had some tedious boring middle parts\, and it certainly was not perfect. The combat feels good/great\, story is good/great at times\, sidequests exist but aren't worth much\, and there are plenty of mostly pointless dots on the map for those inclined to clear the map.  Ultimately\, my many criticisms are mostly nitpicks\, and that is why they don't detract much from the otherwise solid foundation of the gameplay\, decent story\, and beautiful world. Hence a 7.5/10.… Expand",true

Even after I clocked in on almost exactly 100 hours after I had completed the main quest and almost all the side quests I still enjoy fighting them and I look forward to tackling the expansion next.I love how you can adjust the HUD to have as much or little information you want\, and still view it at a glance with a press of the touch pad. That is so great (the only complaint there is that I wish there was some more option to just show unheard audiologs etc even if you don't see all other things since if playing with very little HUD as I like to do I missed many of them)There are so many other positive things I could say and I truly love the game\, but I like to focus on the negative aspects in the hope they could be improved for the sequel.This is one of the strongest 9:s I have ever given\, but it is a shame that I can't give it a 10\, because it is sooo close and the reasons why are such small things that hold it back that would have been so easy to fix and made this a complete 10 game. The biggest complaint I have with Horizon is the small but extremely annoying fact that you can't change the time of day in Horizon. Horizon have a very quick and unnatural timescale that shift from day to night. That is a nice feature in most games\, the problem here though is that Horizon looks so amazing during daytime with some of the best lightning and environments I have ever seen\, but at night it all becomes a grey mess where you can't see much of anything. There are some rare exceptions where the moonlight can shine nicely in the jungle\, but most of the time spent at nighttime is just so bland and boring compared to daytime and I did not even want to enter new areas during the night since I would not appriciate the new landscape like that. I also had a feeling of stress during the day and even though I often wanted to just stop and take in the environments I hurried on because I knew that the bland grey mass of the grey night was soon coming.It is beyond me why they did not just have a simple function where you could change the time\, the games save system is resolving around campfires so it would have made perfect sense to be able to adjust the time there or just have it move 8-12 hours every time you rest at a camp. It is such a small thing\, but it really made a negative impact on the game.Another thing that is annoying in the game when so much is near pefection is that dialogue of NPC:s often repeat themself way to much. Some shop keepers even shout at you to come and talk to them just after you have bartered with them. It is beyond me how they could keep it this lazy when they have put so much care into the rest of the game.Also the game suffers from some invisible walls and since I prefer to play with as little fast traveling as possible this was most notible and annoying when trying to go between starter areas and later areas. The game is made so that you are supposed to travel from the starter area through to the later areas\, but when going back you have to travel through the previous areas. I can understand why they made it this way so as to not have the player wander off to long at the beginning\, but it would be great if it was possible later on to traverse over the mountains to quicker get around the map back to all other areas. Aloy (the main character) is great at traversing cliffs\, but there are some places and mountains where you can't cross over because of invisible walls etc.Most of the texts from the old world you find outside in the world are vapid\, completely uninteresting and badly written. A sense of lost potential.Also while I love the main character and think she is great\, there is the jarring feeling in the rest of the NPC:s that there is some sort of feminist diversity thing going on as so often these days. The vast majority of the powerful good NPC characters you will come across are women and it feels very unnatural and forced at times. (Though again\, the main character is great and very likeable)Now with that out of the way\, again I absolutely love this game and everyone who have a PS4 should get it (And if you don't have one I actually think it is worth getting it for this game). I would give it a 9.6 on a scale… Expand",true

I haven't had this much fun since Doom (2016).Presentation is very high point of this game.

I was very surprised when it turned out the story was quite fresh and delivered very well. The protagonist was well written and I have quickly got to like her. I can't wait for a sequel to learn more about game world.Inventory and looting mechanics are probably the 'worst' part of this game. You spend a lot of time fretting about inventory space - I have opted to upgrade it ASAP. It's also worth noting that (at least in my case) you get nigh on the best gear halfway through and it makes looting much less exciting later on. I think there should have been at least two more gear tiers after 'purple'. There's also not much to do with most stuff you loot and especially money. Except for buying wires which are used up QUICKLY\, I didn't buy almost anything for my entire playthrough and finished game with probably more money than king of Meridian has.Doing all side quests except for tutorials and hunting grounds the game took me about 60 hours to complete (progress meter stopped at about 81%).I recommend it to anyone.

The main character is uninspired and of course has a bow. Another action game where you use a bow\, not very original. I guess I'm just over these formulaic open world games since playing RDR2.It's hard to go back to the old standard. The characters are thoroughly uninteresting and the mechanics are the same as just about every open world game that's come out in the past couple of years\, namely Far Cry. I found little reason to care for the characters or the mystery in the story. You also get the standard branching dialogue response\, which basically gives you the option to be nice\, mean\, or smart. No idea where it all leads as it seems as though it has no effect on what happens. Instead it's fetch this and go kill this and then get x amount of this\, ad nauseum.When the first mission in the game tasks you with \""get x of this and y of this\"" you know your in for some lazy game design. The UI is a total mess and there is so much crap on the screen at once. Simply navigating is hard to do here and of course you can climb but only on pre approved surfaces in certain areas that have the necessary prompts. The upgrading is standard faux RPG action hybrid in the style of Far Cry. You can add things like slow motion aim and auto stealth takedowns. It's all been done before yet better. The stealth is barebones. Hide in tall grass or else you are seen\, lol! The enemies are also pretty uninteresting and uninspired. The look cool though.Like I said\, it's hard to go back to this archaic open world design after playing games like Witcher 3 and RDR2. This game does have some solid graphics though\, which is to be expected since it's a platform exclusive. It also runs pretty smoothly and has a few interesting areas. I'm not too impressed by the rest though. It's a just carbon copy of AC/Far Cry games.… Expand",true

The game is an open-world action RPG done right. It is obvious that the graphics are among of the best of this generation. The game's varying locales make sure that the game's aesthetics never become dull. Great graphics still have the disadvantage of long load times. Make sure you have something to distract yourself with while you're playing this game. Even though the world is large\, every place you can go to and activity you can do has a high bar of quality set for it. The world has reason to be exactly as large as it is. I would not suggest going through all the content\, but at least finish all four cauldrons\, override all five tallnecks\, and get blazing sun ranks on all 15 hunting trials. Though there are leveling elements involved\, there is a substantial feeling of progress and difficulty (which is best set at normal and never changed). Some of the resource systems feel annoying until you upgrade inventory size. The resources used to make arrows are so common that I never felt like I actually had to think about that system. There are enough unique enemy types to where it feels you have something to sink your teeth into\, and you also view them differently as you progress through the game. A robot that gave you some trouble or you avoided at the beginning of the game now feels fairly easy (but not mindlessly so) to take out\, and this feels great. Each robot has a complex array of weak points\, points weak to certain types of damage\, points that you can shoot off to disable some of the robots' attacks\, points that you can shoot to make them explode\, points that you can shoot off to use against the robots as weapons\, points to shoot of to disable a robots shield\, points to shoot off to disable invisibility\, points that are only exposed by shooting other points\, points that the robots only expose on occasion\, smaller points that are detachable for some quick loot\, and points to shoot loot crates off of the backs of machines among other things. On top of an intelligent AI\, there are lots of ways to fight these guys. You can take some time to lay out traps and stock up on health reserves or perhaps override some machines to fight for you. At the same time\, you're not too disadvantaged if you just want to get into the action immediately. Human combat\, on the other hand\, mostly involves shooting people in the head and exploiting AI. It's not awful\, but it's pale in comparison. The variety of viable tools you have at your disposal is as wonderfully deep as the robots' design\, and somehow the game's mechanics still do not feel bloated. The story is a mixed bag. It starts out very captivating and is enjoyable all the way through\, but there is little to no character development or interesting voice acting besides that of the protagonist herself. Only one character besides Aloy (Sylens) felt fleshed out enough for me to feel satisfied. Though the character models look beautiful\, the lip syncing is pretty bad. It was by far the most enjoyable when delving into the ruins of past civilization. There you find text logs\, audio logs\, and holograms that tell a detailed story of humanity's efforts to exist past an apocalypse. Each mission along the main path explains another aspect of this story\, and it gives you enough information to satisfy you yet also want to find more. The story only had one part where I really felt emotionally invested\, and that was on the second to last mission. The ending is a bit disappointing. Also\, for a game that has tons of battles against giant robots\, ending the game by fighting an enemy type that has already popped up many times before is underwhelming. The game's ruins show some colossal\, ancient war machines that perhaps could have been corrupted by the game's main villain to make for a great final boss.… Expand",true

As a side note I'm more of a casual gamer and have always been a fan of open world games like Fallout as well as action/RPG games like the new Tomb Raider franchise and uncharted.I'll start out with the negatives first and then go to the positives.  Some of the combat mechanics and movement seems a little bit \""janky\,\"" to borrow an internet term.  The worst cases of this are when jumping and with Melee combat.  I honestly think the melee combat is the worst element of an otherwise very polished game.  The lack of a lock on means you are kind of guessing and either hit or completely miss.  Luckily\, this is a small component of the game.  I also feel like the facial animations are good\, but not always great.  There are minor details like getting out of the water or strange jumping/climbing mechanics at times which take away from the immersion a little.  Another nitpick is that the enemies respawn very quickly.  It keeps you on your toes\, but I sometimes felt like wandering around and having to always go around or take down enemies can become a chore at times that I'm in an exploring mood.Now on to the positives.  Nearly everything else is close to perfect.  The graphics and world are amazing to look at with a lot variety and some of the best (if not the best) weather mechanics I've seen in a game.  I'm fortunate to have a 4K tv and PS4 Pro and this game really shines on my system.  My tv is even mid tier (Vizio M 2016) and it still is the best looking game I've played\, but I have yet to play Uncharted 4.The combat is unique and if you take the time to learn the different enemy weaknesses\, utilize a variety of weapons and plan your attacks it's a lot of fun.  I'm usually the type that sticks with a couple weapons I like and I was doing this at first with the game and getting frustrated by the more difficult enemies.  Once I started playing the game using the various combat mechanics as it's meant to be played\, it really becomes enjoyable.  I'm looking forward to uncovering the story and completing the game.  I can't wait for the DLC and also (hopefully) follow up games to the IP.On a side note\, remember to save often.  It's annoying to spend a lot of time taking on enemies and gathering resources\, only to die and have to start over.… Expand",true

This engine was used to create Killzone: Shadow Fall\, Until Dawn\, and isHorizon Zero Dawn is the answer to the question of What would happen if self-sufficient sentient robots took over the world. Guerilla Games alongside Sony released Horizon Zero Dawn as an exclusive to the Playstation 4. The Decima engine that Guerilla Games developed continues to shock me at how powerful it is. This engine was used to create Killzone: Shadow Fall\, Until Dawn\, and is currently being used to create Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding. The engine’s ability to use the Playstation 4’s power to push out the kind of graphics seen in Horizon is impressive in its own right.The gameplay consists of different kinds of projectile weapons and a single melee spear that has limited upgrades. You start off with a normal bow that you can use to shoot regular arrows and fire arrows to light your enemies on fire. The repeated act of shooting the bow seemed boring at first\, but as I progressed\, I started to really get into the combat. Each weapon provides a different means of taking the enemy humans or robots down and eventually I found a combination that became my go-to. With different status projectile types and different weapons\, the equipment system has a surprising amount of depth. The fire arrows light the targets on fire and the freezing arrows briefly freeze the target then make them receive more damage. There is a time slowing mechanic during combat that even makes aiming fun. To complement this mechanic\, Aloy also has a detective ability similar to the ability found in the Batman Arkham games. Using this ability\, you can see highlighted body parts of the robotic animals that can be torn off. During combat\, you can use Aloy’s ability to focus and slow down time to carefully aim and shoot at the highlighted pieces of the robot to deal extra damage. The ability to slow down time is one of my favorite parts of the combat. The game is always full of moments when I could slow down time and fire an arrow at a specific part of a lunging sabertooth-like robot. As the arrow makes contact\, the targeted part rips off the body in an explosion of sparks\, killing the robot\, seconds before it would have hit me. The variety of weapon combinations and the diversity of weak spots on creatures that you encountered leads to a surprising amount of depth on a simple projectile based game. Although I had a set of weapons that I really enjoyed playing with\, I found myself tinkering with my equipment\, constantly trying to find out what else I can do with each weapon and what attachments would improve them. The worry of projectile only weaponry in a game that takes a lot from Dark Soul/Monster Hunter combat quickly dissipated as I got into the game. That doesn't mean that I wasn't sad that I couldn't use hammers like the Oseram do.Horizon Zero Dawn is probably Guerilla’s best work to date. A game with an engaging story with strong gameplay to back it up. The graphical fidelity of their Decima engine only makes me question how long it would take for my PS4 to melt from the raw power it needs to make it look this good. The flaws are minimal in comparison to the best parts about the game. Despite having similar map and collection structure to the Far Cry series\, having the collectibles revealed and having only 5 towers to climb makes accepting that structure easy. I made the wrong choice and tried to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild alongside Horizon Zero Dawn. While both fantastic games\, the heavy gameplay soured me on the open-world aspect of either. Regardless of my idiocy of trying to play two massive open-world games simultaneously\, Horizon Zero Dawn’s story and gameplay kept me coming back. Each new story quest and new iteration of robot animal gave me the drive to see the game through to the end. I clocked my last save after reaching the end at\, 45 hours. The average time played for others seems to be about 40 hours according to howlongtobeat. If you are looking for an immersive story driven game with strong and diverse gameplay\, this game is for you.… Expand",true

With it's huge size and beautiful changing landscape\, i believe you could enjoy the game by merely gazing at the views for hours. The interaction comes in all the robot animals there are to hunt and fight against throughout the world\, and from all the collectibles that are hidden throughout. I would rate Horizon's world a 4.8/5.Now when it comes to the storyline of a game you want it to draw you deeper into the game itself and and not let you go until you completely the entire storyline. Horizon Zero Dawn doesn't quite deliver on this level. It's storyline is motivated and intriguing but the slowness that is present in certain parts of the storyline pull you out of the game and don't capture your attention like it should. For storyline\, Horizon gets a 3.5/5Zero Dawn may have its downsides but when it comes to graphics it certain does not lack beauty. Mixing the breath-taking landscape with the design of the robots\, villages\, cities\, people\, and even the water\, you feel as though you are actually entering a real world that brings enjoyment and delight to the eyes. Graphics are definitely a big part of Horizon and for me i would rate it a 5/5Now we get to the last criteria for a great open-world game: a fully functional combat system that contains variety. Sadly Zero Dawn lacks variety when it comes to its choice of weapons and attacks. The biggest focus for the game is on its ranged weaponry and the variety in arrow types but when it comes to the hand-to-hand combat there really is nothing besides a spear and two attacks. For its combat system i would rate Horizon at a 3/5.Overall Horizon is an incredible and enjoyable game but it does have its weaknesses. 8/10… Expand",true

The game itself is split betweenHorizon: Zero Dawn may not be a flawless game\, but it absolutely is a game that was needed for the open-world genre. With an outstanding new combat system\, gorgeous world\, and by putting an immense amount of thought and care into the tropes it implements into its world\, this game has thrown itself into stark contrast against most of the open-world genre. The game itself is split between indoor and outdoor areas\, with the latter being the superior of the two. The lighting in the outdoor areas is stunning\, and the excellent work with shadows grounds even the more ridiculous creatures in the forests and grassy plains they're in. In terms of aesthetics\, this game is untouched by any in terms of quality except for possibly Uncharted 4. This especially works in favor of this game when it comes to the more basic mechanics like the stealth. Despite it being extremely limited\, the grass is the only thing possible to hide in\, the visuals stop the mechanics from becoming unforgivable. It's much easier to get sucked into the experience in this game rather than a game with less polished visuals and audio. However\, despite the visuals doing their best\, the stealth mechanics do get stale eventually. They function virtually identically every time they're introduced\, and due to their simple nature\, feel inferior to the more open-ended stealth mechanics of games like Metal Gear Solid V. The combat\, on the other hand\, needs no outstanding visuals to sell itself. Against the robots\, this combat system is one of the greatest systems ever made. By giving each weakpoint a functional use\, and removing that use with each weakpoint Aloy knocks off\, it gives every battle a unique ebb and flow\, and when the battle shifts to Aloy's favor\, it feels like you're overpowering a giant titan. The human combat is much less impressive\, the humans don't take advantage of the game's systems or do anything interesting in terms of attacks or strategy\, yet the combat still simple fun in its own right. The worst moments of the combat\, are never unforgivable. Walking down a hallway and stopping to shoot a few mindless human enemies may not be technically impressive\, but can be fun for the brief periods of time its introduced. Luckily\, multiple story missions do use the robots as enemies\, leading to many unique moments rarely seen in other games. The Point of the Spear is extremely good at giving the player the freedom to experiment with the game's mechanics on their own\, which makes everything the player learns feel organic\, and the Mountain that Fell is an outstanding mission because it puts the player in new environments to fight the robots\, instead of the regular tight corridors and hallways. The cauldrons\, while being an interesting idea\, often fall short of being anything special\, due to the basic nature of their puzzles. Often in 3D games\, and even in extremely recent ones such as Breath of the Wild\, the nature of puzzles will be introduced slowly\, so the mechanics feel familiar and difficult puzzles never feel overwhelming. Early in Breath of the Wild\, the player is taught that freezing gears will result in the platforms they're connected to to stop moving. Later\, there's a shrine where the player has to figure out which gear is connected to which platform and when to freeze the platforms to get the chests and still be able to get to the end of the shrine. Similarly\, there is a puzzle in Horizon\, where the player has to figure out how to get from one platform to another using cogs\, yet the puzzle isn't built up much at all\, as this is the only time where the game brings up being able to switch the direction of the cogs by hitting the light in the middle. Despite the lackluster puzzles\, however\, the cauldrons are amazing at creating an atmosphere\, and the battles at the end of them are always top notch and outstanding at getting the player to think quickly in tight spaces\, so the experience evens out. The side quests all have interesting stories\, but they unfortunately fall into the same trap of following the trail of purple on the ground\, so in my experience they are quite repetitive to complete one after another. The main story is intriguing\, and makes the player always want to experience more\, thanks to how well it controls information. For every piece of information revealed\, there's a new question asked\, always a new mystery to solve. This is almost a downside\, however\, because the story requires constant attention\, doing anything besides following it breaks its pacing. There is very little downtime in the story and therefore the player will either follow the story and not do what they wish\, or they will do what they wish\, such as explore or do side quests\, and it will break the flow of the story and remove the dramatic tension. This never ruined my enjoyment however\, and despite its flaws\, in my opinion Guerrilla has made an outstanding game\, and a must-play for PS4 owners\, so I'm going to have to give this game a strong 8 out of 10.… Expand",true

Поэтому то новое детище от Guerilla Games и является противоречивым\, ведь если вдруг атмосфера не зацепит\, лор покажется не интересным\, а тяга к исследованию не успеет завлечь\, то расстройству не будет предела\, так как в плане игрового процесса ПО СУТИ Horizon: Zero Dawn предложить ничего не сможет.

They did a really good job keeping side missions interesting and not repetitive like many other games. The game is much more challenging as you are essentially trying to hit moving bullseyes on machines. The concept of shooting cannons off machines is nice as well as overriding machines which you have to work for\, not just a gimme. The different machines with different strengths and weaknesses is a nice touch\, as well as a variety of ways to take them down. Maybe it's just me\, but it's refreshing it's not all about blood and guts. The pace of combat and mechanics were put together nicely\, It's not easy to make a grown man shriek as he flees a fictitious machine known as a ThunderJaw.The bad: Some of the dialogue gets cheesy\, and some of the character deaths are especially hollywood cheesy\, dying immediately and dramatically after uttering their last words. There are moments where the facial expressions seem a bit Mass Effect-like but only \""moments\""\, it's not distracting enough to be an issue. After you buy maps for flower and other locations\, it would be nice if Aloy would say something as  you near one of them. I found myself having to backtrack to get those which takes some of the fun out of the game once it becomes an errand instead of in the flow of the game. As important as the power cells are\, they really needed to make a point of Aloy mentioning them during missions they are available. Otherwise it takes quite a bit of work to backtrack since they don't make parts of the world available after you complete certain missions (thought this was an open world game\, leave it open!). There are also some glitches where Aloy won't move when on a perch or she falls in-between some boulders and can't get out. Watcher AI is poor when if you just stand there. They kind of just look at you and don't do anything. Seems the best way to avoid them is nonviolent confrontation\, perhaps a lesson here from Guerrilla Games\,lol.… Expand",true

The game is huge and in other open world games I got bored searching for the collectibles and lore\, but the game is just so much fun to play that I never felt fatigued doing this with Horizon.The only aspect of the game I didn't really care too much about\, was the skills and weapon upgrades/ trading. I found that about halfway through the game I just didn't need or care about upgrading certain things as they didn't add anything for me. I also didn't really think the trading was that useful as once I had my favoured weapons\, I really didn't need much else. This isn't to say these aspects of the game are badly done\, just that I didn't really get much from them.I do think it's time that sites like Metacritic need to start removing those reviews that have quite obviously been submitted to bring a games overall score down.

Never have I experienced enthralling battles with just bows and traps. Every battle\, whither you’re facing a Watcher or Thunder Jaw\, is intense and strategic. The one behind the bow\, our protagonist Aloy\, is a character full of magnetizing determination and confidence. And the world she inhabits is gorgeous\, dangerous\, unique\, and immersive. But even with all those pros\, there are some cons. Where Horizon Zero Dawn stumbles is in it’s story\, settlements\, and side quests. Almost every side character is forgettable or dry. I never found myself ever truly compelled by the emotional weight on the side characters shoulders nor did I care. One character I truly did not care for was the lead villain. He is terribly flat and cliche. And his fate is so anti-climatic that it’s laughable. Unfortunately along with the characters that aren’t Aloy\, I must also say that the story for the most part was not impressive and neither was it’s conclusion which I found terribly predictable. Then there’s the settlements. The settlements were nice looking but empty. All I ever found to do in the settlements were to accept a side quest or find a merchant selling basically the same thing to me as the previous merchant I found in another location. Speaking of side quests\, many consist of “follow the trail” or fetching an item. These are fun but get awfully repetitive at one point. Along with the bland objectives\, the stories weren’t the most memorable either. But even with it’s downfalls\, Horizon Zero Dawn still shines brightly in my mind and trophy list.

There are a lot of things that Horzion does very well. The story is inventive and unique. The visuals are stunningly detailed. The characters are sincerely depicted and reasonably fleshed out. It doesn't really do anything badly although there are a number of areas where it falls a bit short and for me that is what narrowly prevents it from reaching masterpiece status.Gameplay overall is very good. The combat is excellent. It is challenging but rewarding and the variety of tools available to you offers a wide range of methods for solving problems. Almost every battle feels different and each type of robot requires a different strategy. The game does a really great job of easing you into its combat and allowing you to naturally learn and grow with Alloy. This works to benefit the story as well. There is a large variety of enemies that you encounter and you aren't expected to fight all of them. Some of the enemies you meet can kill you instantly so in many cases you need to use your best judgement to determine when to fight and when to flee\, I really hope more games learn from this. My only major problem with the combat is that it requires you to abuse the dodge roll.. Outside of combat gameplay is also solid with pretty simple menus and overall intuitive controls for the most part. Where gameplay suffers a bit is the platforming and general interactivity with the environment.  Alloy is an expert climber but unfortunately her climbing ability is limited to very straight forward programmed paths. That level of interactively might have been acceptable 10 years ago but in a post Assassin's Creed world I would expect better more interactive traversal in this type of action game. Alloy has a grappling hook but you can only use it in very specific areas\, many modern games do a far better job with similar mechanics. Overall the gameplay is very good but could still be improved in multiple areas. I give it an 8.Story/Progression: The story of Horzion is very unique and for the most part very well told. The basic premise is great but what makes it special is that it blends together personal stories with big epic ideas. It is also very well paced\, there are several key reveals throughout the plot that gave me a sense of satisfaction and yet made me want to learn more. My only major complaint with the story is that some of the quests felt generic and some of the story telling through the holograms could have been shown in a better way. Overall the main story is great though. I give it a 9.The world of Horzion is beautiful and for the most part very well crafted. Each tribe has a unique look and each region has memorable features. The variety of environments ranges from ruined cities\, vast jungles\, snowy mountains and mechanized dungeons. Almost every area looks great and is full of intricate details. Where it falls short is that some of the ruins eventually become very repetitive. There were also a number of places that I ended up getting stuck just because objects were positioned in an awkward way and the collision between them. Interactivity within the world is decent but could have been better. Overall it's a really good open world but not one of the best.Visuals Design is excellent\, this is one of the best looking games of this gen. Characters\, environments and robots are all expertly crafted. The animations are mostly great. Facial animations are a bit stiff but I would take that over some of the wonky facial animations in many other games this gen. The characters look fairly realistic but still manage to be unique. There are just a few minor visual flaws that prevent it getting a perfect score. The water looks pretty mediocre. Also a lot of the caves are very bland and unappealing. The lighting also goes through dramatic shifts at times that can be jarring. Without a doubt though this is one of the best looking games I have played.The characters are quite good. Alloy develops at a very natural pace and is given a backstory that informers her abilities as a fighter and her personality. She feels fairly believable but is also iconic and that is difficult to pull off. Sylens was the highlight for me though\, he is a very complex character and his complicated alliance with Alloy is a highlight. There are many other decent characters although I felt a lot of them lacked an individual purpose (the sun king is an example). The villains are decent but could have been better.  Ted Faro didn't really fit his role.Sound Design is great in pretty much every area. The voice acting is very good especially from the lead characters. The music is also excellent and for the most part well used.. It is just slightly bellow the top tier of gaming soundtracks for me.I give Horizon 87%Gameplay - 8Story - 9World - 8Characters - 9Visual Design - 9Sound Design - 9Uniqueness/Ideas - 9Length/Amount of Content - 9Immersion - 9X-Factor - 8… Expand",true

The climbing and running along pre-made jumping paths is somewhat buggy (or at least that is how it felt to me). The game borrows from Uncharted but is not as finely orchestrated in climbing areas.

And the moment I saw Aloy running around in a colourful world full of plants and that consists of a mix of past and future elements I wanted to have it.And it was worth the wait.I immediately thought of what the story was about. And overall I was right. The story might not be something overly unique but it is very well told and should be able to get you emotionally\, especially as sometimes the music and atmosphere does the rest. Where often I listen to some of the more calm scores and they sound so sad\, it just fits this time and theme. The open world-action RPG style is very good and works fine. It is nothing completely new. Nothing in this game is completely new. But there are gazillions of games; really everything that we see in a game will at least somewhat remind us of something. And Horizon at least has its own or not so common spin on things.The world is really great to look at. I might say though\, while indeed it is big it is not nearly as big as people might think. And what we thought of as climb-able - well\, no\, not everything is climbable. That has something to do with the fact that not every spot in flagged to be ciimbed (some of them can still be jumped up to but not really everything as far as no glitches are concerned) and of course very often when you see another big mountain or part of an area you will very much notice that you cannot enter or climb higher. Why is that? Well\, it is the end of the world map. And as long as you don't insist to do an out of bounds glitch that stuff is not for you. But the world is fine as it is - except for the flagging thing; It really should have more flag-to-climb-spots. There is enough to do in this game\, whether you just want to run around and explore\, do your side stuff or find out more about the main story - and the data logs for finding out more about the past also are somewhat interesting and help showing you how alive this world is and what it all was about\, even if it is just about smaller details of people that are dead for a long time.Aloy is just one great main character and I cannot wait to see more of her in the obviously coming sequel.… Expand",true

De manière générale l'histoire monte vraiment en puissance tout le long du jeu. Bien que se cantonnant à une histoire de rivalité de clan dans la 1ère partie\, la deuxième tranche radicalement car elle est beaucoup plus centrè sur les mystères entourant l'univers donc beaucoup moins avare en révélations. N'oublions pas non plus le côté épique qui s'accentue à mesure qu'on avance.Mention aussi aux quêtes secondaires qui ne tombent pas dans le fedex bas de plafond et qui permettent de découvrir pas mal de personnages attachants et très charismatique pour certains et avec des histoires propres à eux.Je n'oublierais pas bien sûr de mentionner Aloy que j'ai adoré incarné\, je trouve son histoire vraiment magnifique et sa quête m'a vraiment conquis ! Un des personnages féminin du monde vidèoludique que je garderais en mémoire !Pour ce qui est du gameplay je trouve qu'Aloy est super maniable et fluide dans ses déplacements\, c'est très simple à prendre en mains et c'est vraiment un gros point fort. Les combats eux sont très épique notamment face aux machines les plus féroces du jeu\, on sent bien le contraste en terme de dangerosité des machines entre la 1ère zone et le reste de la map. A ce titre je trouve l' IA des machines très agressive\, ce qui pousse le joueur à ne pas se contenter de foncer tête baissée.Pour le reste des features de gameplay\, Guerilla s'est contenter de faire simple et efficace et ça marche admirablement bien\, le studio n'est pas tombé dans le piège du monde ouvert bourré de contenus sans queues ni têtes\, ce qui je trouve ne nuit pas au plaisir du jeu car on ne s'éparpille pas de tout les côtés en terme de gameplay.Maintenant j'en viens à l'énorme point fort du jeu\, ses graphismes et sa DA. Sans doute un des plus beau jeux auquel j'ai joué. Le nombre de fois ou je me suis arrêté pour contempler les environnements qui sont juste sublimes :bave:Le jeu offre des panoramas vraiment hallucinant ! Je salue cette richesse\, on visite des zones montagneuses\, des forêts luxuriante limite tropicale\, des paysages arides et désertiques bondè de canyons\, des montagnes\, des villages tribales\, des creusets\, des ruines de l'ancienne civilisation et l'ensemble sublimè par des effets météos d'excellente facture qui accroît encore l'ambiance du titre. A ce titre j'ai pris encore une plus grosse claque dans la gueule qu'Uncharted 4\, cette richesse au niveau des environnements me semble un cran au dessus\, le mélange entre le monde actuel et les ruines de l'ancien monde fait que l'on est constamment scotché au plafond. D'ailleurs l'énorme travail au niveau de la DA\, on la ressent aussi au niveau des machines avec un design vraiment bien pensé et travaillé. En bref Guerilla m'a vraiment étonné\, je ne pensais pas qu'ils étaient capable de faire un boulot de ce niveau.Pour finir je pensais à être déçu car j'attendais le jeu avec impatience mais il s'est produit l'inverse\, il m'a scotché de bout en bout\, j'ai pas vu les heures de jeu défilé.

A lot of standing around while watching holograms or listening to audio (in the main quests!!)-Aloy is a boring character. As a player you don't get a lot of choice during dialoge and story beats\, since Aloy is a predefined character. That would be okay with me\, but unfortunately she is presented like Superman (or rather a Superwoman) who can do everything and has a flawless character (so she is pretty much a Mary Sue in this game). This kept me from really connecting and relating to her character).-the progression system feels broken. There are one or two insane difficulty spikes pretty early in the game. This is due to the Open World design\, since there is no incremental increase in difficulty\, just two huge leaps. As an inexperienced low level player the enemies the game threw at me were incredibly overwhelming. I was constantly low on ressources and went through the game in stealth mode but still died countless times. At level 50 however\, with better stats\, skills and equipment i didn't feel challenged at all. Because the game world pretty much has the same difficulty wherever you go it gets really hard for a while and then easier and easier and my inventory was cluttered with ressources.-facial animations suck. dialoge scenes and cutscenes in general are rather weak-some quests i really didn't like. There is some filler in there and other quests feel broken (e.g. the Hunter trials\, where you have to perform timed trials and then get rated. Unfortunately they usually  go like: best possible rating on first try or they feel close to impossible)-many gameplay mechanics are ripped off from other games but not build upon\, sometimes they also don't really fit into the game world (e.g. Aloy can do incredible Uncharted-style climbing\, but only in specific areas\, in other areas she can't even get over a small fence. Pretty frustrating in an Open World)-the skill tree felt rather bland to me)All in all not really a must buy\, but if you are looking for a Open-World game with pretty graphics and cool monsters this is a good pick… Expand",true

It's still a diverse crafting system with many options.The UI is crystal clear\, the menu system is perfectly organized\, and everything seems to have just the right depth. I'm convinced that Horizon was the product of meticulously analyzing its predecessors and pinpointing what works really well and what didn't work so well\, and perfecting everything.Anyone saying this is just another Far Cry Primal has the analytical abilities of a toddler.

The main character of the game is Aloy a girl who is part robot part human and different\, woah woah\, from everyone else. Her voice acting is sub-par by today's standards as well as her animations\, lipsync\, character development\, and general personality. She's just your typical witty heroine against the world cause something bad happened to her.The combat of the game is slow and monotonous. Usually you just sit back and use arrows and when they get close you roll away with your unlimited i-frames and unlimited stamina. There are options to use traps and such but I never found a use for them outside of where the game forces you to use them. My largest gripe with the combat is how dumb the arrow system is. You have to craft arrows as you need them and that could be a cool mechanic but Horizon zero Dawn just puts it down to a simple button press. You get loads of scraps from enemies and then just press a button. There's no animation\, no thinking\, no wait time\, no anything. You craft them mid combat with no repercussion. The game could at least have you stop and do a little animation leaving you open for attack but no.The entire inventory system of the game is flawed too not just crafting. Every enemy drops a bunch of crap\, you're very limited on space until you expand\, and even will a fully expanded inventory you still fill up with ease. The game wants you to do management but the usefulness of items is so poorly portrayed since everything is automated I have no idea what to ditch and what to keep. Often times I will ditch an item only to have it needed in the next quest I picked up\, it's a huge pain.The graphics on the game can be good at times\, mostly in screenshots. Animations are poorly done in this game on everything that isn't a robotic animals. Humans\, realistic wildlife\, and foliage are all just choppy or weightless. The animation that most irked me was the lifeless look of Aloy's bow drawing animation. There's nothing behind it and having to look at it as often as you do you'd think the developers would put a lot of time into it specifically. But it's boring and weightless. Just awful to look at. I've had a few enemies glitch into rocks and other terrain as well as NPCs bug out during dialogue and sometimes stop moving entirely. Very immersion breaking. On the plus side the textures for a lot of things such as the robots and plants are very well done. Again the human assets are poorly done.I don't want to spoil the story too much but let me just say that it's very generic and exactly what I expected out of it. There was a chance for a twist and the game decided to just go the typical route. The ending does set it up for sequel potential\, I don't see it getting one\, but it's there. Everything is tied up at the end so don't throw a fit at a cliffhanger.All in all game looks pretty in screenshots and can have a few fun moments like sliding while shooting. But they get boring fast and the game leaves little to keep attention. Typical overworld game bogged down by glitches\, bland gameplay\, and a very easy to read story.… Expand",true

Combat is almost entirely bow and arrow and this is very disappointing to me. It gets very repetitive and downright boring after the first few hours. The bow doesn't even act like a traditional bow\, but rather like a sniper rifle\, which just seems so unrealistic. The side quests seems like pointless chores. It really seems that they went for quantity over quality with these side quests. They're really really bad compared to the likes of Fallout and Witcher. It really seems that this game tried to incorporate elements from various other RPGs and the end results is an unoriginal and forgetful game. Some of the best visuals ever on a console. Rivals PC graphics. But the core gamplay and story is completely lacking.… Expand",true

It can be difficult to know where the game wants you to climb\, and where you can or cannot make a certain jump.Additionally\, camps look amazing and are full of life\, but they feel limited in their interactions. Events happen around you\, like an interactive cinema screening\, and at no point did I really feel like I was immersed within the cities or its characters. There's loot to pick up and NPCs to engage with but buildings are seldom accessible and when they are\, they're mostly just for quest purposes with little depth to really get stuck into.I get that this is an action game above all else and there's no doubt Horizon succeeds in this area. Its story is strong and its presentation almost flawless. Occasional camera issues\, repetitive mission design and moments of rough movement hold it back from being truly phenomenal\, but this is still a must have title for PS4.… Expand",true

The story itself is on point and very different\, but the way it chose to tell you of its past was too distant - which does make sense in the stories context. While game-play is one of the strengths of Horizon\, it just copies too many elements from other titles and misses out on extending them in innovative ways. Especially the climbing sequences are very linear\, while dungeons look all the same and bore you sometimes. Another strength of the game are its graphics\, but the lightning effects (especially during night) are terrible sometimes. I do not know what happened there\, maybe it is just my Playstation\, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt for not having the resources or professional expertise.Overall\, the premise of the game as well as the game-play are on point\, but the game just misses out on delivering a new experience.

The revelations of how civilization as we know it rose and fell\, and how this new one came to be are brilliantly told and I loved this aspect of the game. These parts of the story were extremely enjoyable\, morbid\, interesting and emotional. The tribes and the stories based on their conflicts and ideologies aren't as compelling\, but they are still fleshed out and enjoyable\, and the game balances the past and present well.The gameplay of Horizon is great\, and hunting robot dinosaurs is as fun as it sounds. The machines are quite visually distinct and are all well designed\, both in terms of looking cool and in terms of how they serve the gameplay\, as they all have different strengths and weaknesses which rewards some degree of strategy. There's enough variety in the enemy types and weapons to make combat fun from the start of the game to the very end. Shooting a machine's own weapon off it with arrows\, and then using that same weapon to take the machine down is satisfying. The Frozen Wilds DLC introduces its own new machines which are also fun to take down. I do wish there were more mounts though\, as there are only three different types in the whole game and they're all quite similar. Perhaps it also would've been cool if you had more direct control over machines you override.Another thing Horizon: Zero Dawn nails are the graphics - they are consistently amazing\, and I found myself taken aback by just how good the game looked on a regular basis. The photo mode got a lot of use from me. Facial animations are usually decent but some side characters look a bit off.Horizon has a big open world to explore and a lot of content to play through\, but not all of it is to the same high standard as the main quest. Some of the side quests and errands are much less inspired\, and the rewards you get for them are frequently underwhelming\, although there are some exceptions. I was also not a huge fan of the climbing system\, as it often felt clumsy and way too linear. The paths you can climb are too obviously laid out\, which weakens the sense of natural exploration. It feels too restrictive\, especially when compared to the climbing in Breath of the Wild. Another thing I wasn't overly fond of is the inventory space\, which is just too small\, even when fully upgraded. I found it annoying to keep having to open up my inventory to dismantle some resources or mods to make room for new ones.Overall though\, this is a game that I had a lot of fun with\, and I loved the worldbuilding in particular\, including the character work.The Frozen Wilds is also a really strong addition to the base game. The new environment is gorgeous and the side quest rewards are an improvement on those in the main game\, as you get to upgrade your spear and are given some really powerful new weapons. The Banuk are an interesting tribe and the main quest of The Frozen Wilds is pretty good.All told\, I'm leaning towards a 9/10 for this title as it succeeds in both artistic merit and in the cathartic fun of destroying huge machines with a bow and arrow.… Expand",true

Same goes to the amount of different armor types you can buy. In my 100% playthrough I used 2 armor types\, got the special one at the end and that was about it. Probably on the highest difficulty this might be more necessary it is still a bit sad that on the intended normal difficulty it does not make any difference how you equip.Gameplay loops are standard open world styled. You can gather multiple types of collectibles\, do timed hunter challenges\, get main and sidequests while you progress by foot or mount through the immensely vast world. At the beginning fast travel is limited to consumables which is a kinda strange decision but it helps to keep immersion and get in touch with the world. The unlimited travel can be unlocked in the first part of the game so it is not much of a problem for people who dislike this decision.The skill trees are nice and it feels that you can emphasize on your personal play-style. Some skills are rather useless throughout the whole game whereas some should be skilled asap for maximum benefit. There is still not much you can do wrong. I missed that my focus ability was not able to get an upgrade for enhanced vision\, wider range and highlighting stuff better. In my opinion something that would be immensely useful because finding collectibles can sometimes be very painful. Climbing indicators are sometimes vague and if you happen to go on collectible hunting at nighttime you might be up for some rage.All this still makes HZD one of the best games I have ever played. The amount of depth and details is immersive. The story is very cool and innovative. The world has a decent variety and you will be definitely busy for at least 20 to 40hrs+ depending on whether you go straight\, do side-quests or completionist. Please be aware of that this review does not include the addon but solely the maingame.Considering you can grab this game including the addon for 20 bucks is honestly a steal and does underline my decision to give it a 10 besides some minor design flaws and subjective aspects I pointed out. People who like action adventure typed games which have a classic open world touch will definitely be pleased.… Expand",true

Im spanish and although mine is the second most spoken language in the planet after chinese we are not used to get good dub or even dub at all\, in this matter the game is another 10\, the best dub actors have been brought to this game to give it a cinematic flavor that maybe only control has managed to achieve too\, in this case we have Michelle Jenner as Aloy and her acting is top notch!Graphically speaking is beyond a 10\, i dont know if it is the shaders\, the textures or even the lighting but \, you guys know that feeling when you apply a Shader mod to skyrim and certain views look like a photograph? Well\, thats is STAPLE on the whole game\, everywhere at any time of the day to a point where most than 8% of my 68h in the game so far is exclusively on photo mode\, just breathtaking.Lastly as im speaking about the pc version i must acknowledge the optimisation\, i have read lots of blogs about how badly it runs or looks on pc and I couldn’t disagree more.... i have A LAPTOP\, an msi gs65 (i7 8750H - Gtx 1070 max-q) and i play with everything on high\, textures on ultra and models detail in medium and i get 55-60 fps ALWAYS anywhere in the game (before the patch) all that plus the fact that ANY of my components surpasses 65ºc for me means ROCK SOLID optimisationPs: the only issues i had in terms of bugs and-or crashes was when i tried to OVERCLOCK my components (seeing them so cold I thought\, well.....) but once Oc was deactivated every bug and crash disappeared like magic so I encourage those readers dissagreeing with my experience on optimisation to disable overclock and check themselves.I ended up loving this game\, a lot!Not enough to get a ps5 to play the sequel but enough to borrow my brother’s to play it.It doesn’t matter if youre a sonyer\, nintendo fan\, xfan\, master race... whatever\, if you do love gaming this is PURE JOY and though this might perfectly be a marketing stan to make people get the ps5 for the sequel we cant ignore the generosity on Sony Studios part for bringing this game to us...At the end this game makes me think differently about everything SPECIALLY exclusives;After enjoying this game THAT MUCH\, who am i to feel great about certain people not being able to enjoy breath of the wild 2?I hope companies realise what i did\, being a fangamer in general is happier and less toxic than being a fanboy and fanboys are born with exclusives.… Expand",true

Though that was boring i sensed irony in the story. All that happening in the 31st century. But i felt like playing The Witcher 3And that's the part i liked. Because we have the potential to do it. We have so futuristic and technologic dreams and expectations from future but we have the potential to destroy ourselves and wipe all life out on Earth. Ironic story was intriguing. No game is perfect and this wasn't perfect too. In one mission i had to kill the whole Cultists and the Corrupted machines.It wasnt possible without doing it silent and smooth. I mean you can't just go around and kill everyone in order. You have to be organised and kill in a logical order. Anyway in that level i thought if i kill one by one and walk out of their attack range it would be silent and smooth. But after i kill one cultist and walk out of their attack range game reseted the progress and the cultist i've just killed spawned again.

I appreciated how few bugs I encountered considering how many times I’ve had my experienced really hampered with this in other open-world games and how intuitive it all seemed from the controls right down to the inventory. I enjoyed being able to fight on my own terms and make the game my own. Thought the AI was good\, more-so the “animals” that the humans but having so many things interact differently with the environment and each present a different challenge that needed to be adapted to was an aspect I revelled in and left me feeling a happy sense of achievement\, as did the whole game once completed. I also appreciated how the devs managed to make this a game that players new to gaming could enjoy whilst still being enjoyable for more experienced gamers\, which I feel is rarer than it should be.All in all\, I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game and am happily anticipating the next one.… Expand",true

The large amount of side quest caused the story to stagnate 30% through the main story line\, losing audience in the way.Graphics - Impressive\, however\, the frame rate always dips when you have too much going on. Also\, there's some serious problem with lighting in this game. There are times when the screen is so bright or so dark that you can't make out anything. At night\, if you tilt the camera angle down\, the screen becomes so dark it looks like a silhouette. I seriously think there's a bug in the lighting.Game play - They did well slowly introducing new mechanics using tutorial throughout the game. However\, there are some really frustrating things you'll have to deal with. One thing for example\, is that when you aim your bow at enemies in the sky\, the grass will often completely block your view because the way third person camera works. It can be infuriating at times.Sound - The music was good\, but it was used very sparingly. Most of the time there's no sound at all.World building - For an open world game it has a reasonably large map\, but it's definitely not Zelda or Witcher large\, and they clearly cut corners in some places. For example\, many towns would have almost nothing but a tiny square inside the walls. The main enemy base has NO towns. All they had was a tiny courtyard with people making noises but no NPC's.

I applaud the amount of effort that was put into the datalogs to explain the world for those who wished to have a deeper understanding. Many hours could be spent reading and listening to the datalogs. I enjoyed the side missions and spent most of my time in the game doing them. With Cauldrons\, bandit camps\, various collectibles\,  corrupted zones  and tallnecks\, Horizon did not feel boring even when I wasn't doing the main story. The music of the game was suitable for the kind of world that Horizon takes place in\, I was humming to Aloy's theme all day after finishing the game. One the game's biggest strength was it's visuals. Playing it on a PS4 Pro and a 4K TV\, I would often stop just to admire how magnificent the game looked and as a result I made the most of the photo mode. Horizon's biggest  drawback is it's secondary characters. While Aloy has become one of my favourite female protagonist in videogame history\,  the same cannot  be said for the other characters in the game.

It can definitely be said that this is not the most important aspect of this game. 7/10.Combat System / Gameplay: Oh my God! It's just amazing. I don’t have enough symbols to describe how great it is\, there are enough weapons for different fighting styles\, battles with cars are exciting and addictive\, especially if you play on pre-max / max difficulty level\, in this case\, the game turns into a kind of challenge ... The artificial intelligence(AI) of robots deserves respect\, but it should be said that in this contrast\, battles with humans look weak. 10/10Open World / Side Quests / Characters: The world is full of different activities\, side quests\, hunting trials\, etc. It all comes down to fighting ancient robots\, and for me this is definitely an advantage of this game.Characters who live in different settlements are plastic and do not react in any way to the main character\, you can literally jump over his heads. But this is typical for most role-playing games. 8/10Total: objectively this game is 8/10\, it has some problems and drawbacks. But playing it\, getting carried away by the delightful gameplay and battles with robots\, all these problems fade into the background.I'm looking forward to continuing on playstation0 5 and hope that most of these problems will be eliminated.… Expand",true

Some catastrophic event has happened and the world is also inhabited by robot animals in various sizes. During the story you will uncover the truth. Lets start with the story. It is some of the most engaging in videogame history and I have played hundreds of games. Be it the story of “Zero Dawn” and the disaster that hit mankind or Aloys (and Rost) story. It is always excellent and you will want more until you get the final conclusion. In short it shows the best and worst of mankind. Also the side characters are well done too. I enjoyed their stories and struggles. Be it the mysterious Sylens\, the matriarchs of of the Nora\, especially Elisabeth Sobeck\, Erend\, Olin\,  Avads struggle to change past wrongs or Talaanah. In short there are plenty good characters here and their side quests and development is meaningful. The world is huge and filled with many enemies\, villages of different tribes and challenges. This would not matter enough if the gameplay was not good. It is however excellent. Starting from the beginning where Aloy is taught to hunt you will always get better as you acquire better weapons\, tools and abilities. This game gives you a lot of tools and possibilities to defeat your human and robotic enemies. You have to be careful as attacking blindly strong enemies or groups of enemies will get you killed. I like the AI of the enemies. They search for you\, retreat to a better suited place when you are in a spot where they cant attack you and swarm you if they can. With many tools and preparation (of traps) you can overcome all enemies (Of cause there are exceptions). It is so enjoyable when you defeat tough enemies just with careful laid out traps. You should or better said must also use stealth. With the right abilities you can severely damage enemies before the battle even started or vanquish them instantly. A minor complain is that you too much have to rely on the right kind of bushes;-). There is a crafting system in the game. You can improve your inventory and add parts to your weapons / tools that improve them. Again it help's a lot. In total I enjoyed how the story and game play compliment each other. The combination makes an addicting and enjoyable game. Overall this is a masterpieces for its story and characters. I will praise it as one of the best in videogame history. The gameplay and characters round up the mix to a remarkable experience.… Expand",true

Like\, a lot.  I haven't run into anything game-breaking per se\, but many of the bugs mess with my immersion.  A couple examples:* Sometimes you'll hear dialogue from enemies you've already killed from afar when you reach a position that's close to where the enemy was positioned.  There will be no one around (I snipe quite a bit) to say whatever you're hearing\, but there's the audio anyway.* Sometimes\, in a certain zone\, enemies will reset and heal all their damage\, or will disappear and re-spawn in their original areas\, if you run just a little too far.  I mean\, an enemy can be two steps behind you\, and if you run just a little too far from where the enemy spawned\, the enemy will just disappear into thin air.  You'll come back to the zone\, and all of the enemies you killed there previously will be alive again.  *Irritating*.* If the game crashes before a \""boss fight\"" is about to start and reloads right at the start of the boss fight\, then all of the traps that you setup will no longer be setup\, and they'll be missing from your inventory.  You get to proceed with the boss fight without your careful planning.One area in particular was full of bugs.  It's like the QA team just didn't bother testing the area.

You don't \""upgrade\"" weapons really\, you just craft more ammo slots\, kind of lame.TOO SHORT - Main story line can probably be completed in around 8-10 hours\, with 40 hours to platinum and do everything the game has to offer.  That is just simply too short for a title like this to me.SHALLOW MAP - map looks good on surface\, but there are no real dungeons/caves/\""metal ruins\"" to go to outside of the main story. Sort of like having Skyrims map with no explorable dungeons\, gets boring quick. No reason to explore because you never get better gear by doing so.EASY TO BREAK - if you get the blast sling early\, you can down all machines with ease\, taking very little strategy.TLDR; if you go into Zero Dawn looking for the Witcher\, Fallout/Skyrim RPG experience\, you wont get it. You will get a very \""face value\"" game that will win a ton of awards at the end of the year. Worth the play through\, but zero replayability or longevity.… Expand",true

That was until I was finally able to play it...a few hours in\, and a listening of the Nora Tribe's backstory revealed a  hidden agenda in the game. The hidden agenda in the game becomes more blatant the further a player progress in the game. The hidden agenda made blatant is that of gender.  To quote a part of the Nora Tribe's backstory\, (which can be heard at the festival\, before Aloy's trial\, by sitting on log before going to see Teersa) \""The Metal Devil was defeated by All-Mother...\""If you put this into context The Metal Devil=Man/Male\, and All-Mother=Woman/Female. The very relationship between the two is that of a \""Male vs Female\"" one.The game becomes redundant in story via dialogue about Aloy being a female. In essence it becomes the equivalent of reinforced learning\, by which I mean the torturing type. It is clear from the outset of the game that Aloy is female (we clearly see this continuously visually)...there is no reason to keep making it a focus throughout the game...via dialogue (both main quest\, and side missions). It really took away from the story because of this...it's like the writers were trying to convert players to their way of thinking.A method of thinking that sees women as superior to men. Clearly this is not an exaggeration either\, as it can easily be seen throughout the game. Men in this game play a secondary role of sorts\, all at a level (less confident\, less assertive\, less leadership\, simpleminded\, etc...) beneath that of women. Even at the outset of the game...Rost (Male) is a outcast from the Nora Tribe's matriarchal (Female) rule. No male in the game is equal to a female character\, and the majority of the males are antagonist. So in the writers eyes (in this futuristic setting) all females are virtuous. Although fantasy...this would never be the case\, there would be good males/bad males. and good females/bad females. There still has to be a balance...tilting the scale in either direction results in a skewed perspective\, which is bias.After playing\, and beating the game...I can say with a certainty that I will not be buying and playing the sequel. I thought that eventually they would stop with the gender war\, but they didn't...even at the very end. There was still a GREAT EMPHASIS placed on the female gender. The writers couldn't even end the game on a neutral (balanced) note.If I knew that a agenda would take center stage in this game...I would've never bought it to begin with. It's safe to assume that the sequel will continue said agenda. I rate the game a 4...2 points for gameplay\, and 2 for graphics (both creative in their own right). The story would've received a numerical value if it didn't have a gender agenda within it.… Expand",true

Controls are well designed and easy to use.  Although it's an open world\, it is easy to follow the trail of quests from one place to the other without getting lost (which I often do in open worlds).  The storyline seems well constructed\, but to be fair I only played about 15 hours before deciding not to proceed any further.So why only 5/10?  First is the combat system.  Now I may have been spoiled by the AI in Sniper Elite 4 a little bit\, but these opponents are idiots.  Straight up.  I was really excited when I saw that you could do stealth kills.  Far less excited when I saw that I could pull and stealth kill entire packs of mobs.  Sometimes they'd crawl over the dead bodies of their companions to get to me so I could kill them.  Next was\, for most mobs\, a 'sphere of influence' type AI.  I was fighting several mobs who were nearly twice my level - and winning\, just because I could shoot them a few times and then move away from them.  They'd 'reset'\, but kept their lost health.  Rinse\, repeat\, profit.Next problem was the traps.  They were cool when they worked\, but more often than not you either didn't get a chance to use them because you came up on them too quickly\, or they'd refuse to follow you outside of their little domain.  Worst of all\, you were limited to the number of traps you could carry\, and if you set a trap but it wasn't used\, you couldn't recollect it.  It was just lost.Essentially\, the combat system makes the game feel very repetitive and boring.The other issue was with the storyline.  There has been a lot of talk about the feminist agenda in here.  I think there is some validity to that.  Not because the story starred a female protagonist in a matriarchal world\, I think that was done reasonably well; however\, after a while it started to seem like all the bad people were men\, and all the good people were women.  Not exclusively\, but fairly consistently\, and when the men were 'good' they had a fairly severe character flaw\, whereas the women didn't.  I can't say if the game continued that way\, though it's easy enough to find out if you google for it\, but after a while it got tiresome.  Personally\, I'd like to see more female role models in these games (I have two daughters)\, but not at the expense of making men the bad guys.I'd be lying if I said the feminist overtones in this game didn't influence my choice to quit playing\, but in truth it was the combat system that really did it.  My last half hour of the game was playing it on the toughest setting\, outnumbered and overmatched (by level) and still managing to kill off the enemies with little trouble.  I just couldn't picture myself slogging through another 40 hours of that.… Expand",true

The nitty gritty is that this game suffers from what I call \""quest overload\"" where you get so many side quests thrown at you that you can't decide on one\, and soon you realize that you're level 17 and that quest you got was level 4 so you ignore it.  Some enemies (and almost any enemies if they catch you in a group) are excessively challenging and have only one weakness\, requiring you to squander all of one resource killing them and requiring a concerted attempt to resupply yourself afterwards.  Generally\, though\, the right weapons\, upgrades and skill can take down any enemy.  The story is a little hard to follow; there are kind of three big things going on at once and I was only really able to figure out one of them by the end.

Side quest requires you to trace the foot print from East to West\, kind of like purposely ask you to do so just to show the players how nice and huge the open world is. The map is indeed huge but kind of empty. Not sure is it just me\, the fonts are too freaking small to see.In the end\, this is just my opinion and maybe open world game is just not my cup of tea.

Animation is a bit janky\, though not enough to impact the experience. Best looking game on PS4 currently.Gameplay: 7.5/10 - Third person combat is focused on variety of weapons and tactics to target weak points on enemies to remove components. Emphasis on stealth takedowns and dodging to avoid attacks. Nothing unique but it is fairly fun and well done.Story: 7/10 - The story and sidequests are decent and help to create a backstory and cohesive world. Story is typical post apocalyptic tale with some unique elements. It's okay but people who play many games won't be blown away by the narrative.Sound: 6.5/10 - The music and machine sound design is really well done although machines often sound like they are right on top of you when they are actually a good distance away.

It started off really fun\, but by hour 5 i got so tired of it. The game doesn't know what it wants to be. If it wants to be an RPG like Witcher 3 or an open world action game like RDR2 or far cry. It has lots of elements there. Like stealth\, action\, RPG elements\, dialogue wheels and crafting. But none of those elements are done well. Stealth is so bare bones as to be laughable(Hide in tall grass\, rinse repeat)\, dialogue wheel choices don't matter to the story\, action is bland\, enemies have bullcrap long attack animations that can home in and hit you from across the map. It loses its tactics when they break their own rules and set you up in situations that you can't stealth or study the enemy(Which is what it has been teaching you all game). The open world is also completely empty of any life\, save for useless collectibles that i couldn't care less about. Also one thing i really can't stand is all the busy work\, even getting health herbs for the next fight is a chore. There is also no options to buy health herbs at a vendor making it infuriating. WTF do i also have to buy a whole new bow to use shock arrows\, like seriously tell me why? It is such a pointless way of forcing players to change out weapons unnecessarily. The story is also extremely bland. The relationship with Aloy and Rost is not very well developed\, it never gets to a charming moment between them or anything. Which i thought we were going to have\, it is her adopted father after all. Not like in God of war. It isn't completely bad but it never rises above a slightly above average in terms of writing. The character of Aloy is really cool looking in my opinion i even based a TTRPG character off her and Senua. But in game Aloy is not very well fleshed out and the voice actor is not that great. A different voice actor and a better script could've gone a long way\, as games like the Witcher 3 came out around this time. I have also heard of some kinda agenda pushing\, while i haven't gone far enough to see it\, if it is true. It has nothing to do with why i think this deserves a 5/10. It is no system seller\, it is a painfully average open world action stealth game. I think the developers should have tried something new with the game. Added some kind of new mechanic like the nemesis system from shadow of mordor and make the players use whatever ammo they can craft to flesh out the systems they implemented better.… Expand",true

The lighting\, the textures and everything else is enough to make you stop and stare to no end\, easily one of the best looking games for current gen.The sound is the second and it's crisp\, clear and precise. I normally praise DICE for their sound effects work but Guerilla have hit the mark here. The music is also great\, blending a sort of relaxed\, slow\, elder scrolls esque score with techno for the fights\, it works really well.The story is intriguing and deep\, you want to explore you want to learn and it's not just the main story that captures this. The ruins and side quests draw you in with a sort of \""hey check this out\"" vibe and I often found myself of the beaten path\, eager to discover new things.The combat is pretty good\, not the best system I've seen and a lack of enemy lock on can be a bit tedious at times as you try to roll away and end up rolling towards. On a whole though the combat is solid and enjoyable and the machines are incredible\, deadly and often clever.There are some issues\, although small these do cause problems. The waypoint system can be frustrating as the game seems to generate a series of on screen waypoints that lead a trail to the objective which often conflicts with the compass waypoint. Clipping is also an issue as there are often hedges and grass covered in snow that is just clipped through by the character. A lack of water ripple effects and grass movement is pretty unacceptable for 2017\, especially when there were rumours that this is running on \""the most powerful next gen engine. It is worth noting I have encountered no bugs at all during my time with it and frame rate has been 100% consistent.That said\, Horizon offers an open world with a difference\, an intriguing story and machines.

I thought the animations were very nice\, although the facial animations were good\, I've seen even older games do better with it. (Beyond Two souls on ps3 is one I can think of)A few complaints from me are:-Sometimes while fighting enemies\, usually I had problems with the larger machines. They would forget I'm shooting them and just walk off to finish their day. You would even seen the red bubble above their head turn yellow.-I constantly found myself getting stuck in weird places. One was inside a crucible in an area I know I shouldn't have been in. After not being able to get back to the main area I walked into a wall and died. Got a little laugh from it though.-Also I found myself getting stuck between things and after lots of maneuvering got out-I was a bit displeased with the variety of items. Only a few armors and literally 3 different rarities with weapons.-And this last one is a little more of annoyance. I felt like the game reverted back to old old games when the final cut-scenes took place it placed her back into her basic outfit.

The game also competently brings down the witcher 3 from its throne and challenges the white witcher in every aspect . Not only is the character Aloy an enjoyable character embodying the mannerism's of the likable hero like if Lara Croft and Nathan Drake had a illegitimate child Aloy is the result\, But the fluidity of the combat and the brutality of the weapon work makes every Kill a must share moment . Usually in open world RPG's the slaying looses its finesse within in the first four hours but somehow Horizon Provides enough weapon variants to make the shooting of mechanized monstrosities a sight to behold.

Yes climbing a tallneck is a lot like the towers from Assassins creed\, Yes clearing out bandit camps is very reminiscent of Far Cry 3 and Yes Dungeons do feel a lot like Destiny  however even with those elements thrown into the pot Horizon still manages to stir enough flavour into this dish to give it some much needed taste. The story is intriguing and as you explode this vast multi-layered world you will enter more Ruins than Tomb Raider .

The focus mode which lets you spot **** has even slower camera movement and you walk slow as **** and I can't understand why.I'll update my review once I 100% the game.The game is actually good buy it.… Expand",true

Horizon is primary focused on the story. Forget copy pasted activities\, searching for hundrets of treassure boxes or participating in boring fetch quests. This game feeling is similar to Withcer 3 or Mass Effect 1. Every mission counts\, eveyr main mission moves the story forward\, every side mission is small story with cutscenes and dialogues in some interesting dedicated location. If you like story games\, but you dont like being slown down but grinding bs that is there just to prolong game time\, this is a game for you.Other reason why the story is so interesting is completelly new world and lore. This is not another zombie / ww2 / dragons / aliens game. This is completelly new unseen world and it is joy to explore it and its history from scratch. The game makes sure you get all the answers in a satisfying matter.The other great part is a combat. The game is not so much about healthbars (shooting randomly does a litle damage). But you need to focus on the weak spots. Each with different effect\, when destroyed. (you can disable certain attacks\, tear the armor to uncover weak spots\, damage energy cell to cause explotions\,...). Each enemy is different. Witch different weak parts and different attacks and AI. It is really satisfying to tear them apart piece by piece watching as they go weaker. Even the common fights with some of the bigger enemies are more fun and chanllenging than  most of the boss fights in other games. (I really wish Dark Souls or Bloodborne bosses offered this kind of interactivity). Because of this combat system the enemies are really powerfull\, but still not a boring bulletsponges. They are bulletsponges anly if you fight the wrong way. But if you make a good strategy\, you can take them down easily.Another great aspect is the game world and map. It is no so big as Just cause or Witcher 3 map. But it is still pretty big. The main advantage is that it is packed with interesting and unique areas. You will not encounter miring miles of flat plains here. Every place looks beutifull and you can be getting beautifull wallpaper images every minute :-D It is real pelassure to explore the map\, vilalges\, mountains\, etc.All in all this is great experience.… Expand",true

The story is totally boring and I never cared to hear what anyone has to say or watch the cut scenes. Doing so anyway would only confirm my inner feelings that I should've just skipped it. The missions are boring and very tedious. Running from point A to B and back again felt like a drag and only seems to exist to artificially extend hours of playtime. The voice acting was bland which is partly due to poor storytelling and partly due to actor's inability to perform well. The open world\, though beautiful\, is also dry. It lacks one of the most important factors any open world needs\, immersion. Outside of killing robot dinosaurs\, running boring errands for random people\, or picking up pointless collectibles\, there's no living in the world. You don't build a home\, you don't sleep\, you don't interact with people outside of quests\, and there's no everyday-like activities taking place that you engage in. There's not much here to justify the game being an open-world in the first place and could've just as easily been a linear game\, where Aloy travels from one end of the map to the other on a path to find out about her true identity and purpose. This game feels like they created the gameplay concept\, then tried to force a story and world to fit it\, and at that they failed.

Outfits are nice balanced. You are not limited with only one armor and modification\, you can use the best one depending on situation and you can exchange modifications as you like.

You don't need to override the machines to make them fight for you. Just use Corruption arrows! As I said\, this is a fun part so please ignore those zero score reviews they're not real.

A lot. Unlocking traps\, potions\, new ranged weapons gives you the variety and options to tackle the most difficult enemies in the game; and you will need to mix it up\, which is a great way in making the player experiment with different combat strategies.I could go on and on about this game\, but I won't.

I know that rpg gamers have high expectations and Last Horizon doesn't exactly meet them.Last Horizon Zero Dawn is best approached as an action game with rpg elements.Basically if you came into the game expecting Far Cry\, you will be pleasantly surprised.If you came into the game expecting witcher 3 or skyrim you will be massively disappointed.There are no real leveled stats or gear just tiered weapons with \""modification coils\"" that you use to give certain buffslike elemental damage\, armor piercing and regular damage.  When you level you get 10 extra HP and a skill point to use on thesomewhat limited perk/skill system.  It is mostly passive skills\, not many active skills.  Besides the relatively simplisticcombat and leveling system the sidequests are relatively boring with a lack of emphasis on interesting characters and deep narrative.There are a few exceptions but I will not spoil them.  Basically witcher and skyrim have much better side quests with more attention to detail.Another issue was the audio\, there was alot of echoing and poor surround sound support.  You would expect an immersive open world to get theaudio right..... right???Now that I got the negatives out of the way let me tell you what this game does right.  The main story.  It is wonderful and has some very deepand emotional content.  The combat.  It is very fun and it was engaging and made me interested in learning about the different effective waysof taking down certain machines.   The visuals.  It was stunning and HDR really brought out the colors and contrast.A lot of mid-tones were crystal clear and wouldn't have been with 8 bit color.  I wish their non engine cut scenes were in 10 bit but oh well.The frame pacing is also really good and there were few frame drops.  I am a PC gamer as well and I have a 144hz monitor but the frame pacing did agood job of preventing headaches and dizziness with the 30 fps cap.I had really low expectations for this game\, mostly because Guerrilla Games never made a rpg.  I also knew that if Sony wanted to make this gamea console seller to kids they would have to make it pretty \""PG\"" to expand the audience.  Fortunately there were some adult themes\, but not many :( damn kids.Overall I was expecting Far Cry with robot dinosaurs but Last Horizon Zero Dawn is more than that.For all the RPG nerds out there like me here is my scale for this game.Far Cry------Last Horizon---------------------Witcher 3… Expand",true

Let's start with the combat system: it's clunky. The best way I can explain why is that I cannot shake the feeling that the fact if an attack hits is calculated immediately after the attack starts\, but ignores what happens during the \""animation\"". This often times lead to you dodging out of the way and still getting hit\, because the enemy just changes trajectory to hit you. You get used to this really quickly\, but it's far from being a good combat system. Aim assist for ranged weapons tends to feel random (sometimes you hit small animals even if you're not even aiming at them because of \""arrow magnetism\""\, but other times you aim at the head and just seam to miss by a micrometer).Next up is the \""climbing mechanics\"". Horizon would have deserved a free move / climb system\, but unfortunately opts for a \""you can grab ledges at certain\, predefined points and nowhere else\"". It's not bad per se\, but it just feels \""off\"".Overall: 9/10Horizon: Zero Dawn is a technical masterpiece and definitely one of the must-play games for every PS4 owner out there!… Expand",true

If you enjoy vast open world games you will like this game. On top of a wonderful world it has some of the best combat in ANY open world game I've played thus far. Yes it is limited\, but thats because this game isn't trying to be as role-playing heavy as something like elder scrolls. The combat is fluid and can be approached in a lot of ways. It also has a simple stealth system that fits smoothly in the game (if you expected this game to have stealth as good as MGS or styx thats just stupid). The story may not be for everyone\, but with a badass main character\, and well done side characters it is easy to get absorbed in the story. It's true the story doesn't mount up to things like the Witcher 3 (at least thus far) but come on\, thats not really a fair comparison to make\, cause very few open world games have a story that does (also don't pay attention to those who knock the ENTIRE STORY in a review that was written in less than 6 hours after the release of the game\, I haven't finished the game yet\, but I enjoy the story now more than I initially did in the first couple hours). All in all this is the best open world game I've played since the Witcher 3\, and since then I've played some great games like Fallout 4\, Skyrim\, MGS5 (loved this game immensely but as far as the open world goes it was a bust)\, and Final Fantasy XV (not sure I would call this game great but I had a lot of fun with it).While Horizon Zero Dawn doesn't provide the most amazing side quests\, they are better than those in FFXV and MGS5 so if you enjoyed those games I'm sure you will enjoy this one. Also it makes up for the concept of the quest being lackluster by having AMAZING COMBAT. Seriously. My favorite games are bloodborne and the first Dark Souls\, if that helps give you an idea of what type of combat I like (Horizon Zero Dawn is much less punishing\, and deep\, but very close to as fun and exhilarating).This is a great game\, both in visuals and gameplay. Is it perfect? No. But I wouldn't say any huge open world game is. They're big projects\, expect some hiccups. If you like the open world style you will like this game.… Expand",true

The writing is just too lazy\, with plot holes the size of craters.It does not help that the NPCs and dialogues are completely forgettable\, and to be honest kind of creepy.Combat system is OK\, and interesting at first\, but gets extremely repetitive later on. This is not alleviated by the low variety of weapons either\, where you basically play with four arch type weapons with elemental effect modifiers\, but still spend 90% of the time on your basic bow.… Expand",true

You hardly ever see any loading screens\, one initially when you first load and of course if you die but even those are nowhere near as long as we have come to expect.The voice acting is very compelling\, the lip sync is a little off in some side quests but its very acceptable considering the amount of dialog and is far superior to most games. Character modals are exquisite and full of life\, although again in side quests facial animation is limited.I hope this is a success for Guerrilla games they deserve the accolades and sales figures\, this is a superb game that I will come back to and show to other people to say this is what modern games look like\, sound like and play.

I'm glad I started on the higher difficulty\, because it added some moments of frustration throughout the journey pushing me to try out different strategies I may have otherwise ignored.CombatThe combat system is highly tactical and a lot of fun.  The robot enemies are well designed\, and the combat system allows you to disable different weapons that leads to a very diverse combat experience as the enemy's tactics will often change mid-battle.  I found myself at times sneaking past enemies as I traveled across the open world knowing one wrong step would lead to a battle I would not be able to win which added a lot of excitement.  Combat against human enemies is not nearly as fun.  In these situations\, I took it as an opportunity to treat it as a stealth game further diversifying the game.  Even by the end of the game\, I never felt that my weapons had out scaled the enemies which left the open world experience a lot of fun.  There are not a a lot of weapons in the game\, but they all have a very unique feel and greatly affect how you play.  In my opinion they did this right\, as you are left to customize your weapons forcing you to determine what you want your strengths to be for each weapon as they have multiple ammo types they can each use.  I found the final armor in the game disappointing\, I quickly switched back as I felt it really took away from the make no-mistakes type of approach the game had going for it.Story LineThe story line goes where you expect it to go and then the is more.  The story is delivered in a very meaningful way which kept me wanting to see how it would unfold even if I thought I knew where is was going.  Your caught between the main protagonists perspective of what is happening and what you the gamer are curious about which is interesting.  The story really did flow which is why I did not do too many side quests on my first play through.  The side quests that I did play\, I felt were well delivered.  I tried not to pick up a new side quest until I had completed the one that I was on as to keep more a continuity going.  I'd suspect grabbing all the side quests at once and punching them out quickly would lead to a less desirable experience.GraphThe world is just beautiful and the affects are amazing.

That it does. And nearly all of them can one- or two-shot you if you're not prepared. So Horizon's WIN button goes like this:Tag the robots\, lay some traps\, lay some ropes\, stealth kill one robot from behind\, get noticed by the others because you're not squatting in the grass anymore\, try to target their weakspots with the bow and fail because it's slow and they're twitchy machines\, frantically dodge roll as they come at you (Dark Souls - sorry DS) and lead them into the traps you laid.

My only gripes are some of the voice acting and parts of the storyline are blah\, the vendor comments in Meridian are annoying\, some quests are redundant\, can't upgrade spear very much\, but overall a very good game.  I enjoyed hunting animals to make bigger carrying pouches\, learning to take down machines\, finding loot\, crafting and never knowing what might be around the next bend.  Taking down your first big machine is thrilling!  The other thing is there are too many outfits and weapons with different features which could have been combined into one or two.  Don't like having to switch bows all the time - love the different arrows but it would have been better to use them with one bow.  Some weapons are crappy like the slings and rope - never used those much - but the tripcaster is a blast.

The Witcher 3 influence is pretty apparent in this game as they also managed to make every single side-quest a self-containing story. You actually care about the side quest as much as you cared about the main story.The gameplay is amazing. I love the whole machine parts hunting and that you have different ways or methods to kill a machine. The game encourages you to be creative with your hunt by giving you a wide array of tools and abilities to hunt down a machine. Furthermore\, your focus (HZD version of a WItcher's Sense) allows you to identify a machine weak point. Which can further be broken down based on what kind of elemental arrows/ammo you are using. It has depth without being too cumbersome\, and it definitely works for the setting. Just wait till you get the feeling of taking down your first Thundermaw ever.Voice acting was excellent\, music was great (the world felt alive because of it) with an excellent fade in and out between a calming music in town\, and adrenaline pumping one during a boss fight.It does suffer from any other open world RPG though\, in which the map can be littered with icons and activities that can feel overwhelming. However\, if you're getting an open-world RPG game\, you should know what you're into. And like The Witcher 3\, HZD managed to make those side activities interesting enough that you actually want to do them.This is a definite buy. There is more than enough content in this game to last you for a while\, and if you missed The Witcher 3 after completing that game\, this is a strong replacement for the genre.Way better than that mass-effect wannabe game we shouldn't talk about.

Recommended to anyone who has lost hope in highly anticipated AAA titles.I don't know which aspect i should appraise. This game is near perfect in almost everything it delivers. Combat and leveling up system are two best aspect of this game. Different variety of weapons allow the player a different approach to kill the machine. Leveling up system is addictive to an extend that I played this game 20 hours straight without a break on two different occasions. Killing machines\, looting\, searching for crafting resources and mods is very satisfying. Some aspects of the game are inspired by latest Tomb Raider. It's not a criticism\, I actually liked how it copied some stuff from that game.There isn't much to discuss when you're talking about the weak aspects of this game. Major thing I noticed is\, this game does not reward for playing on higher difficulties. Not even a trophy. I was expecting xp loot in hard difficulty and switched to normal when I found out there is nothing you get for playing in hard difficulty. Graphics are good but some people are saying they have never seen graphics like this before. Its a straight lie. or maybe they don't play video games too much. According to open world games standard\, maybe this game has the best graphics but not in general. Same goes for story. In video games actual story matter less then the way it's delivered\, and this game had not delivered it properly in my opinion. I'm not trying to say that story and graphics are weak aspects of this game. I'm just trying to say I have played games with better story and graphics.… Expand",true

The characters are fully fleshed out and rarely fall into predicable stereotypes.• Voice acting is wonderful with one or two exceptions\, I rarely skipped a character interaction (which is rare for me).Cons: I would have loved more rpg elements (stats\, abilities\, dialogue options with consequences) and a more interactive environment. I often found myself wanting to be rewarded for exploring the brilliant world by finding unexpected treasures\, enemies or secrets.

The story of HZD is set after the end of the world via Terminator scenario except these one \""eat\"" organic as food (literally) instead of competing for survival\, it's not all doom and gloom as the story\, side quests\, and characters add a bit of humor here and there as well as providing a bit of context as to what each location was once were.Graphic is as good as possible on the current generation of the Playstation console\, there is an incentive to finish the game on the hardest of difficulty\, craft and equip on the go or adapt to the changing circumstance\, story and its conclusion wrap up pretty well (may want to do those side quests)\, a living world (actions and their consequences are visible as the NPCs will discuss events following the conclusion of story and side quests)\, lootboxes (there are no microtransaction involve)\, certain collectibles can be used as currency for loot as well as providing a bit extra to the overall storytelling\, and lastly the machines\, the bigger\, meaner\, and generally more dangerous machines carry with them a very big payday but taking them require a bit more finesse and if necessary improvisation.The game overall storytelling and experience is very enjoyable for me (is there a 9.75 option here?) but loading screen could be a bit faster (ignorable for some) and that is the last 0.25 for a 10.

The plot is interesting and original with plenty of side missions that will keep you busy through out your journey. The main strength of horizon zero dawn is how well it has managed to incorporate mechanics from different open world games without making them repetitive or overwhelming. The world is diverse with different terrains\, sceneries and cultures. There are 5 different cultures in the game with each culture having it's own lore and architecture. Each culture has it's own unique city\, village or settlement  The only negative that I could come up with is the human AI which might be more dumber than a Ubisoft AI.

The robot dinosaur are crafted with care and precision to the equivalent of Overwatch's cast of heroes\, they are truly that unique and different. It never gets old targeting an enemies weak spot and watching it get detached; no longer able to use that weapon.. but wait it gets better you can even shoot out their weapon and use it on THEM! how mind blowingly amazing is that? The challenge of the game is also just right\, 45 hours in\, it never gets old just killing the dinosaurs and watching different swarm of enemies hone in on you. Now the story holds its own and is very interesting (cool concept)\, and most importantly very original. I liked Aloy\, and the supporting cast was very well written and acted; different personalities everywhere. The only negatives which didn't impact my enjoyment at all was that some side quests were bland\, and a perk that broke the immersion for me (you whistle).

Yes\, it takes aspects from other games\, but it refines it to make it original/fun and fresh. For example\, I never said \""wow I wished there was more buildings I could scale to uncover more of the map when I first played Assasins Creed\""; but I definately said I wished there were more Tallnecks to scale\, more cauldrons to uncover\, etc!

For example tear arrows can disassemble certain parts of machines\, removing the ability to use an attack and even giving you that weapon for massive damage\, or even hit a tank and let it explode.

For example the lodge mission and in the end redmaw was a nice side quest.  The rest is nice. I in particular love the cauldrons and what you get from it is a nice surprise.

What I mean is\, even though it's open world this game nails the way a open world with a great story should be. You can explore\, you will love it\, but the story will keep you hooked and even the side quests kinda go side by side with the story. This is nice as you can track everything and do it when you're close to the main quests. For me\, it's one of the best open world along with GTA and Zelda. While exploring you'll get into a long side quest for a collectible. This is related to a personal story of a single person. This story is so rewarding to follow not only because of the little story within it but because it makes you want to explore even more.The story is awesome\, to say the least. Even if you don't understand a bit of AI development it takes a very light approach to the AI complex we are currently walking towards. That's all I'm going to say. I'm not going to spoil it for you as you should go into this game knowing 0 like I did. Forget reading about the story and just play it like you've picked it up from the store without reading zero about story. The story follows a certain path in Horizon so you get a feeling of a linear game where you progress through something\, not opening up the whole world at once. This ends up being a very nice decision as opposed to the new trend of open world and trying to be like Elders Scrolls.The combat is awesome and I only have one concern. The bow physics are not great. Aside from that you will have lot's of fun as you can approach your enemies in som many ways that you'll have fun exploring different things. By the end of the game\, you'll still have multiple ways of getting out of certain situations to keep you hooked.Graphics are excellent but you should really just take a look at some screenshots. Facial expressions are cool too.People compare this to BotW and all I can say is that this one is better IMHO. But not by that much. I love BotW btw but I'll add some comparisons here. What I think is that combat\, the open world concept and story are simply better in Horizon. The combat in Zelda is pretty much the same even with different enemies/weapons/shield surfing/magic and the open world concepts used (and progression within it) are not as refined as in Horizon. The story is also better in Horizon. You can find similarities in the story concept but Horizon is so much better with the mystery and the world built around the world (the lore) that if you're like me\, you'll be googling for more details on certain aspects of the lore.Hope this review helps you!… Expand",true

It amazing that a company who has only made First Person Shooters up until this point made such an amazing game. A weird blend prehistoric and future technology that works well due to a believable world and well-crafted story.Story:I don't want to spoil the story but I will talk about the beginning. The starts out with an outcast named Aloy\, shunned for being a motherless child. You are protected by another outcast named Rost. You find a device called the focus and start discovering more about yourself and how these robot dinosaurs took over the earth. The story seems cliché at first until the twist and turns start happening. By the end\, you will have experienced one wild ride.Gameplay:The gameplay is nice and fluent even at 30FPS. You have many weapons at your disposal like your bow\, The Tripcaster\, and a bomb sling. The combat is nice but the only way to defend yourself is by rolling out of the way\, which 9 times out of 10 you still get hit by something. Speaking of getting hit\, this game is hard\, even on Normal difficulty. It's nice to have a challenge but when multiple enemies on the screen at one time (especially at the end fight)\, it will become little too much.Technical:The Decima engine looks amazing. The best graphics I have ever seen for an open world game. Realistic looking textures that run great even when not using a PS4 Pro. A pretty great soundtrack that meshes the prehistoric and future vibe together. It not the most memorable but it gets the job done. A solid package with no glitches and no DLC to fix mistakes.Final Thoughts::This is one of the best-crafted games I have played in a while. In an industry that is focused on incomplete games\, DLC and yearly sequels\, it's nice to see a fresh IP that feels complete and tells a memorable story. A near 10/10 game if not for the fact of questionable dodge mechanics and a somewhat slow start. If you own a PS4\, this is a must have title for your collection.… Expand",true

I am not ashamed to admit that my first take down took 10 minutes because I was super nervous about how to approach that thing and with what strategy I should proceed.The thing which bothered me a lot while also impressing me was the size of the over world. The map is huge. You could spend hours just walking from one side of the map to another. Luckily there are fast travel packs which you can use to get from A to B fairly quickly\, however\, that was the biggest problem for me. I finished my first play-through without using one of the fast travel packs once. I walked everywhere because I felt like if I would ride one of the machines or if I fast-travel\, I would miss out on too much. The map is so big and it feels like there is so much to discover that fast traveling might ruin the experience a bit. But the problem is that for some quests in the main story you literally have to walk from one end of the map to another which\, as I said before\, can take up a good hour or two.My last point is that\, while the main story is really interesting and fun\, they are sometimes quite repetitive in the nature of what you have to do. The same goes for side quests. And personally\, the final boss fight in this game disappointed me\, simply because it didn't really feel like the final fight. It felt just like any other fight in the game.I just realised that I have written way more negative points than positive ones\, but please\, don't get the wrong idea.

My experience with the company was nonexistent\, but after seeing this game for the first time at E3 2015\, I absolutely fell in love. It looked like a fresh\, fun\, different take on the post-apocalyptic world setting\, and I knew I needed to play it. I unfortunately had to wait until a few months after launch to grab it (thank you\, Nintendo Switch and \""Breath of the Wild\"")\, but when I did finally get the game and sit down and play it\, I couldn't be happier with it.\""Horizon Zero Dawn\"" is an all-around exciting game: it's easy to get lost in\, but you won't mind getting lost thanks to the vibrant\, beautifully-designed landscapes that are brimming with activity and excitement at every corner. The game mixes several different gameplay concepts\, mixing stealth with action RPG elements in an open-world styled game\, and the result is remarkable. The combat could be occasionally a bit bulky\, but once you learn what you're doing\, it's really a blast. It's also one of those games that feels easy to get into\, but also has some really great difficulty curves throughout. And beyond that\, the story is deep and character-driven\, and I have to say that I think it's refreshingly awesome that we have a video game with a badass female that's not overly objectified or sexualized in any way. Aloy is a truly captivating character\, and Ashly Burch's performance as the character is magnificent. This is a game that has pretty much everything going for it\, and even the minor missteps are worth forgiving when you look at the bigger picture.Sure\, the character models might be a small shortcoming\, but the overall design of the game makes that forgivable. Sure\, the combat may be a little clunky\, but it's forgivable when the game is so exciting and there's enough opportunity to learn what you're doing. \""Horizon Zero Dawn\"" is truly a marvel; it's one of the best games of the eighth generation\, and it's an example of how to do a great open-world game with some good crossover here and there. If you haven't gotten to play this gem\, what better time than the present? Give it a shot\, I'm sure you'll love it!Final rating: 10 out of 10 \""Fantastic\""… Expand",true

When you have been playing games for more than 20 years\, new and unique experiences become rare.This game has some really nice visuals\, good audio and solid game mechanics. However\, it just doesn't grab my attention that much. I can play for 15 mins and then I want to do something else.Some machine models really look crap and you think to yourself - \""did a small kid design this specific model\""? Maybe there was a bring your kid to work day and the best creature drawing got converted into a 3d model used for the game. I don't know.The story is intriguing in the sense that you want to know what happened\, and I think at the core has potential. But the journey from start to finish loses that feeling almost immediately. In some cases certain aspects of the game felt more like a chore than a truly enjoyable experience.I see why people like it\, but I have yet to find that connection...… Expand",true
87833,Horizon1,2018-02-19,8,"Good game\, but bland in some places. Dialogue and facial animations especially. The world also feels empty in the way that near nothing is interactive\, and you can only climb on small marked areas\, which feels forced and unimaginative by the developers.

Dialogue and facial animations especially. The world also feels empty in the way that near nothing is interactive\, and you can only climb on small marked areas\, which feels forced and unimaginative by the developers. In my opinion\, if they are going to have climbing in the game\, don't make single routes and obvious climbing tracks. Most NPCs you meet are boring or weird\, not often you come across an interesting side quest for example. I even found myself annoyed by some of the quest givers because of their facial animations and voice. Even the main character is a bit stiff and boring in general. The combat is good\, but becomes REALLY tedious after awhile\, when you have to put around 30 arrows into some of the enemies that you often meet.Other then that\, the world is beautiful and the main quest is good. Have to give cred to the people who created the lightning. Animations of the main protagonist are amazing as well. Overall it is a great game\, but because of so many flaws in terms of quality in comparison to other aspects of the game\, I can't give it more than 8.It's a great game considering that this is Guerrilla Games first open-world game! And I hope that their next title will improve on some of the parts that weren't that great.… Expand",true

Guerrilla Games told us a terrific story from which it's hard to break away. The game has an amazing story\, good graphics\, an excellent combat system\, excellent gameplay and characters that are remembered for a long time. Visually\, the game is simply mesmerizing. You want to endlessly take pictures of all the corners of this stunning world. But the most important thing is the gameplay. The Boy in Horizon is performed at a decent level. Fighting robots is an indescribable pleasure\, but fighting with people is rather boring and dull. The plot also disheartened. In the end\, you will learn almost everything about the catastrophe of the world of Forerunners and there are only a couple of questions. All the characters in the game are remembered for a long time. What does the noble King Awad and brave Erza stand for? The world of Horizon Zero Dawn wants to be explored for hours. It is quite extensive and there is always something to do. In addition\, he is indescribably beautiful and diverse. The ending of the game is very touching and is remembered for a long time.

The most exciting thing for me is what comes next as for a first crack at an open world with a great story its a great 30-40 hours playthrough. The combat is basic but very fast and fluid and looks gorgeous throughout with is a feat in itself for a world as open. Easily one of the best looking games out there. Issues for me was the stealth side of the game\, hiding or staying hiding was too bad but it's been able to tag and know everything so early on making it far too easy and also just calling guards or machines over one by one with nothing alerting them as bodies stack up. Again making it too easy as it's my main fault is its a stroll in the park really. The story (no spoilers here) is gengaging and enjoyable but the same can't be said for the side quests and errands which is a fault with most open world games in fairness and there's a lack of them for a game and map of its size. Along with the story the protagonist\, Aloy is a great character and definitely someone to build a franchise around can't wait to play more games in the Horizon world with her… Expand",true
