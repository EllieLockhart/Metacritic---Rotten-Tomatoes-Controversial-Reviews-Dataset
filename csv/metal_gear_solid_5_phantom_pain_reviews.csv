62565,MGSVTPP,2015-12-23,6,"This is not a 10/10 game\, but it's not the worst ever\, and I feel like I'm being really forgiving for just giving it a 6. I'll give you the number of problems when I first played this game upon release. This is my open and honest opinion\, the people below me giving this game 10/10 are either delusional or fake accounts just tossing in as many reviews as possible to keep this at a score of 80. I'll try and not spoil this for anyone if I can help it.1. The story...It's easily the worst in the series and if you're a MGS fan that plays for the story\, you're going to be disappointed of how badly paced this game is.  The game throws you into an hour long prologue with no real gameplay other then \""run!\"" The cinematic's look pretty\, the cut scenes throw a lot of action at you\, but you'll not really do much of anything in this segment\, it's just an \""ooh ahh\"" moment. The tutorial is nice only because it shows you how much tighter the controls are. After the prologue though\, a wave of confusion sets in\, like why Ocelot reversed roles with Miller (Miller being pretty sadistic while Ocelot feels like the voice of reason\, which is weird considering previous games.) The main villain is easily the worst in the series\, and you don't even get to fight him in the end\, he ends up getting stepped on by Metal Gear\, it's just terrible. Basically he hates Zero and he wants to cause mass genocide for no real reason other then **** it.\""  Quiet is another character added just for eye candy\, which is fine\, honestly\, since they've done this to every female lead other then Meryl (somewhat.) But at least give her a better background\, having her butt naked so she can \""breath\"" is the worst game writing excuse to have a nearly butt naked woman running around\, That kind of **** is for horny teenagers stuck in moms basement. Come on...Psycho Mantis\, a long time favorite of the series is in this\, but plays a surprisingly small role\, and it baffles me that they contradicted themselves when making this game without thinking of the earlier games...Like hard drives (See MGS IV\, memory card easter egg.) Liquid is also in this but is never fleshed out either\, he's just there to cause trouble. None of your questions will be answered\, and if anything\, will leave you with more questions when the game abruptly ends. Why they chose not to focus on Zero and what made him the villain is beyond me.2. There's micro transactions in the game. They snuck this under the radar gents. It's a $60 game\, there's no reason why you should have micro transactions in a $60 game. If you defend this aspect\, you're an idiot.3. The open world isn't really open...There's 2 levels\, a very small Afghanistan and an equally smaller Africa\, neither really separate one another from being different other then one is desert\, and the other is a jungle\, and that's it. There are no actual large bases to infiltrate\, but medium sized to small outposts with a few checkpoints. It tries to give you the incentive to explore\, but after a few hours\, I guarantee you\, you will see not anything new\, and it turns into a chore when you need to hunt down specific targets to unlock more aspects of the game. (Instead of real story progression like how the game has always been). Hardly any wild life\, both in Africa and Afghanistan (I would know about the latter\, there's plenty\, believe me.) Both are just giant wastelands with pockets of outposts to raid.4. MGS has been known for it's stealth mechanics and promoting that sort of gameplay...There isn't a point and it almost encourages you to just full on rampage\, with some of the missions just outright denying you the stealth aspect. What made this game difficult was the stealth\, but there are so many people now-a-days who just want to run and gun\, I can kinda see why they did it this way. There is still stealth in this game\, but it's a joke. Camo is definitely worse then III and IV. Want to change camo? Air drop it in! That's stealthy! It breaks a lot of the stealth immersion which is a damn shame.5. Snake isn't really Snake...As a character mind you\, but he just acts like a mopey idiot. He says maybe a total of 40 lines in the entire game.6.    A lot of the locked items takes hours if not days to complete. That's outright stupid in my opinion and it belongs in ****ty facebook aps. Don't agree with me? Have fun sitting there waiting to complete your \""research\"" for 3 hours. That isn't fun\, sorry.7. For a guy with an army at his beck and call\, you sure don't do anything with them. Sure you can switch characters but what is the point? It's a merc army\, and yet I never interact with them at all. Totally missed out on what could have been a great game mechanic. Dropping the ball and sending them out on missions and...You guessed it\, takes hours.8. The gameplay is actually great\, plenty to do after you unlock everything...Which takes an absurd amount of time\, even for an MGS game. But again\, you'll get bored quickly.Ran out of room sadly.… Expand",true

On the one hand its gameplay mechanics are among the best the industry has ever witnessed\, with impeccable stealth mechanics and freedom that gives you a lot of variety on how to tackle each mission. But on the other hand - it's incredibly repetitive. Mission structures don't give a lot of variety\, with a lot of it feeling like a grind in order to improve your base. Most notably\, its presentation is lacking. While the music and sound design remains top-notch\, including the voice acting. The series is known for pushing the visual boundary of its system and this installment simply doesn't look superb but just great. I was especially bothered by the repetitive and bland environments. Yes\, the desert is supposed to be barren\, but this is way too much. Lastly\, the story feels incomplete due to issues between the developer and the publisher\, but either way\, it's by far the weakest of the series.Overall: Metal Gear Solid 5's mechanics are perfect\, but it's riddled by annoyances in open-world design.

To be honest\, I was skeptical at first as to how much different the gameplay would feel with an open world sandbox design compared to its predecessors. Players are given the freedom to roam freely throughout the environment with structured story missions and side quests along the way. The narrative could've been more refined and polished since it does suffers somewhat from pacing issues stemming from the open world design and countless cassette tapes that we have to listen to. The general plot kept me interested enough to follow through on the missions but the gameplay\, controls and mechanics are the bread and butter of any MGS series.

This is a very difficult game to rate. If you can get through my rambling\, I hope you'll see why.I remember not being able to afford MGS: Snake Eater\, so instead I watched a walkthrough from start to finish on Youtube. I remember watching my friend play MGS 4\, and wishing I owned a PS3. The first MGS game I did get to experience was Peace Walker on the PSP. A fantastic game. It still is one of my favorites. - You might wonder what any of this has to do with MGS5\, and I'll tell you. In all these games I've mentioned\, each had consistent mechanics that made it an MGS game. While MGS V has added and improved upon most of them\, such as the stealth gameplay\, graphics\, the buddy-system and bringing over the base management system from peace walker\, it has missed out on a crucial area which really defines and shines in an MGS game. The narrative.The opening hours are the only time this game feels like an MGS game\, the cinematic feel\, the incredibly over the top yet magnetic action on screen\, and paranormal entities I know I'll be facing in future levels. After that however\, the story flatlines. Nothing happens. You go to Afghanistan\, then you go to Angola. Very interesting biomes\, but after a few hours they feel sparse. There are some interesting plot-lines such as child soldiers and biological warfare\, but none of it really connects on a deeper level. It could have been replaced with another plot-line such as conventional warfare and it wouldn't have made a difference\, other than alter a few missions. Boss fights are non-existent\, and the few that are there are a chore. Run\, dive\, shoot missile. Run\, dive\, shoot missile. Repeat. Peace-walker had better\, more interesting and varied boss-fights\, and that game came out in 2010 for the PSP!Not only is the story weak\, it's pacing is abysmal\, and this affects the gameplay as well. I have a hunch that this is due to Kojima and Konami's less than amicable breakup. This game has the most story padding I've ever encountered in my life. I'm not exaggerating. You can not progress with the main story unless you repeat certain missions on a higher difficulty. Reading Critic reviews where none of this is brought up makes me wonder if the reviewers actually got that far in the game before publishing their review....While the characters are interesting as ever\, there were no memorable story moments. Since this game is a prequel\, Kojima might have been limited in scope and ambition\, but I don't see how that's enough of a  reason for the story to be lackluster. The gameplay is phenomenal\, but the game painfully lacks an MGS story.The reason for my high rating is the exceptional stealth gameplay.While this game is undoubtedly great\, it is not worth the \""Best PS4 Game of 2015\"" . The 10/10s for this game confuse me. Honestly\, reading the reviews\, both Critic and User\, shows me people didn't finish the game\, or even got far into the campaign.While you usually wouldn't find so much focus on the negatives on a game rated 8/10\, you have to understand the lost potential. This could have been the best MGS game of all time. But it's only the best in some departments. I haven't played 1 and 2\, but Snake Eater\, Guns of the Patriot\, and even Peace Walker had a more engaging and flowing narrative. I had no problem with Phantom Pain's segmented mission structure\, where you return to Mother Base (or the ACP) in between missions. But the lacking conjunction of story between the missions is what killed me.While originally playing the game for the very first time\, I gave it a 10/10. Now\, my rose-tinted glasses have fallen off\, and I'm realizing that this is not the best MGS game.My reasons include:- Lack of a story- Boss fights- Immense story padding- No variety in missions- Two interesting\, but albeit empty biomesThe game\, while improving on gameplay aspects\, falls disappointingly short of its predecessors in many regards. Personally\, I am certain it would've been the perfect send-off to the series if Kojima could have had more time to finish the game. It is an incomplete game in terms of narrative. The story is mutilated\, and different missions are too far spread apart\, and too few.The collectors edition has a documentary\, where you can see another chapter of the game title \""Peace\"". This would've been the actual ending\, but alas\, it is missing from the game. This is because the game is not complete. I would've given a rating of 9/10\, but the lack of variety in missions combined with having to repeat missions to progress bought it down to a 8/10.Konami robbed us of this game\, truly.… Expand",true

Whereas older games in the series are literally impossible without stealthy kills and espionage\, this installment allows you to approach each and every mission exactly how you want. Combine this with the massive world map\, countless easter eggs\, ridiculously expansive weapon customisation\, innovative base creation and gorgeous graphics\, this is the best Metal Gear since the groundbreaking Metal Gear Solid\, for me.The controls are tight\, the difficulty is consistently tough but always managable\, and as mentioned\, every mission and side mission can be completed in whatever way you choose. You can sneak into a compound under shadow and slit every soldier's throat in the area. You can call an air strike to destroy entire regiments. You can call on allies to personally assist you in the field. You can set numerous traps and lure enemies to their death. Even when you appear to have messed up a mission\, there is almost always a way to still reach your goal\, and this is one of MGSV's best strengths - even if your careful planning collapses\, nothing's there to stop you whipping out your emergency rocket launcher and blitzing enemies. It is FAR harder to go in all guns blazing\, but the variety offered by the gameplay can suit your mood and you really can make movie-style moments appear from thin air in a rush of panicked decision-making or last-minute successes.The freedom and scale of the game is incredible\, but returning home to your secret base floating in the middle of the deep ocean is so satisfying. As you progress in the game\, loot raw materials\, recruit any soldier you take down (via the amazing Fulton extraction balloons)\, and accrue reputation and money\, you can expand your base physically and technically to suit your needs. Add med bays to keep your soldiers (which you can dispatch on missions real-time for extra materials)\, add research facilities to improve your equipment customisation. The base literally grows every time you helicopter in and is a solid tracker of your game and story progress\, as you try to reform the world's first country-less army.The story is maybe the only thing lacking in this game\, off the back of the fantastically convoluted prior games. MGS is known for its interesting characters and story twists\, and MGSV steps back a little\, with very few truly plot-driven moments. This is evident mostly at the end of the game\, as the main storyline rounds off and only loose ends exist. One exception to this problem is Quiet\, one of the coolest franchise characters in a while. But even she\, with her ludicrous but amazing backstory\, is underutilised. I guess the lack of story focus allows for the immersive gameplay experience\, but I'm sure they could've squeezed in a bit more character development if they tried - it does feel like there's a DLC missing or something.Despite the narrative hiccup\, MGSV is technically speaking probably the best-functioning game I've ever played. Allowing you to completely adhere to your own likes\, dislikes and strengths\, whether that be customising the hell out of your gear\, slowly and tactically taking down enemies\, destroying them completely with nuclear-grade mechas or exploring every inch of the equatorial landscape\, there's something for you.Easily the most fun game I've played in a decade.… Expand",true

Each and every Metal Gear game I've enjoyed greatly. My personal favorite being MGS3 mostly because of the characters. Thats one thing in this game you wont be seeing...anyone with any real personality or interesting traits. They all seem so stock and stiff with everything they do. Snake in this title is border line a silent protagonist which is beyond insane giving the amount of dialogue and cut scenes this series is known for. The story in this title is without doubt put on the back burner which is a huge disappointment to any true Metal Gear fan. MGS5 is a first for the series in that its an open world title. The open world in this game is.....a boring empty hollow husk with reused environments over and over again. This is one thing wrong with the title....repetition. Its shocking how stale and boring this game can become\, whether its the same old boring stock missions you rinse and repeat multiple times just to get to be able to play a story mission. Or seeing the same old reused bases that you infiltrated fifty times over in the past ten hours. You will surely be in shock at how boring you will find this game to be after a good 10 hours of play time. Its so strange because its intro is one of the strongest I've seen in the series...then it all goes downhill from there. Getting into the game play though this title truly does have the best game play I've seen in really any shooter series. Its so fluent and satisfying to shoot an enemy and there is so much to do game play wise its hard to name everything off. More or less if you are a game play fanatic and don't care for much of anything else this title is for you. Metal Gear fans however were put in the back burner I'm afraid due to how much content was taking out. I find that all of these near perfect reviews whether its from professionals or just users. I imagine them mostly to be from people who never were fully invested into the series like I was and many others. If you are a real Metal Gear fan you in no way shape or form could give this title anything beyond a 7/10. For example if you were to remove the Metal Gear title\, get rid of Snake and turn this game into a stand alone title I'd probably give it a strong 8.5/10. The problem is this is a Metal Gear title! Its lost so many of its traits that I just can't enjoy it. To put into perspective how mediocre the story is here is a brief example. Remember Skull Face from Ground Zeros and all of the amazing trailers from Phantom Pain? You get to see him for maybe 10+ minutes out of the entire game....and let me tell you his fate is beyond laughable.To recapMGS5:The Phantom Pain is a great title game play wise. Story wise its border line Call of Duty tier. As a Metal Gear fan this game truly is skippable in my opinion. You wont lose or gain anything by playing or skipping this title.

84393,MGSVTPP,2015-09-12,7,"To say that I'm a huge Metal Gear fan is an understatement. Metal Gear is basically the reason I'm into videogames... and so\, I've be waiting for this title since 2011\, when it was kown just as \""the new game from Hideo Kojima\"". I even preordered the Collector's Edition 10 minutes after it was announced. Well\, all of that make this game one of the biggest disappointments I've ever encountered in my life. HELL I EVEN BOUGHT MY PS4 THINKING OF THIS GAME.Okay\, to be fair I have to say that this game is technically impressing\, the gameplay is superb\, the mechanics and the A.I. are some of the best I've ever seen and it's extremely fun to play. But that's all when it comes to PROS.OPEN WORLD ≠ BETTER GAME. PLEASE\, DEVELOPERS\, KEEP THAT IN MIND.This game renounces on everything that made Metal Gear Metal Gear (Boss Fights\, big amount of cinematics\, a linear but immersive story that mixes perfectly between gameplay sessions making it work as a whole...). After some hours you find that the missions are repetitive\, the storyline unattractive\, and you just keep playing it for its addictive gameplay mechanics and cause you're hoping to find those distinctive signs that made you adore the franchise. The structure of the missions as a shopping list doesn't help\, neither does the fact that the absolute majority of those missions add almost nothing to the plot.After a large number of hours I was hoping that the ending made me see the aggregate of elements as one whole masterpiece... but then IT slapped me right in the face\, that plot twist that was alredy predicted by the fanbase two years ago\, (but I refused to believe) killed the game the same way Naked Snake killed The Boss in 1964. WHAT THE **** WAS THAT. The whole experience made me miss MGS3 as hell\, making me sad to think that no Metal Gear Solid will me that good never again. BUT TO TRICK ME INTO PLAYING WITH AN IRRELEVANT CHARACTER DISGUISED AS BIG BOSS\, THINKING IT WAS HIM\, WHILE THE ORIGINAL IS HIDING?

I also hated the episodic way the game progresses\, there is no flow\, every time I get a mission done I get pulled out of the world and have to pick the next episode\, I liked the flowing progression of the other games\, were you wouldn't have to go from mission to mission\, it was all one story and you picked your own way to get to the end. There are also parts that force you to redo missions on harder difficulties or do pointless side missions to get the next actual story mission....Really Konami? The Mother Base concept should have stayed on the Vita\, its a fun diversion\, but by no means should be the main goal or tide so deeply with the story. It seemed like every time I'd get to a mission id be more worried about getting some B or A ranked soldier out for Mother Base instead of progressing the story\, because if I don't get the soldier out\, my mother base will suck and limit all the weapons\, equipment\, and camo that I can obtain. It boils down to a ****ty card playing game were the soldiers are the cards. I'm not big on playing games with AI companions (I'm level 3 lone wanderer in FO4) I'm the star of this show\, but the companions in the game are pretty cool and are integrated in the game well with multiple camo's and weapons for each person. Still\, Snake roles solo and it would have been better if they hadn't been added. The villains in this game are also notoriously ****ty\, not to mention that most characters are from other MGS titles and the one original character (Skull Face) isn't hashed out at all and dies half way through the game very unceremoniously. Having to listen to story details on a cassette tape player was the equivalent of Destiny style story telling\, which in all honesty crushed me. Where are the epic cut-scenes like in MGS4 that reveal amazing story detail and awesome plot twists? All the while looking at my holographic 3D game menu (which made me ask why these tapes weren't in mp3 since they clearly had advanced tech)which is way out of its time\, even compared to other tech in the game. My last and final comment will be WHY THE **** DID YOU STOP SOLID SNAKES STORY?!?!?!?! don't you understand\, WE WANT TO BE SNAKE not his dad or uncle or ****ed up\,whiny Raiden. This game was made for all the people who like to mindlessly shoot **** with no motive or story involved because they don't like long cut-scenes\, but I submit that Metal Gear is nothing without its story driven campaign\, half hour cut-scenes that paint beautiful and sinister story plots\, and its partial linear qualities\, so I morn the death of one of the greatest video game series of all time… Expand",true

I think it is also worth mentioning the gameplay mechanics have been polished and feel great\, it is the funniest mgs to play in terms of mechanics. Gameplay wise the open world approach has done a lot of good to this series\, giving the player a lot of different ways to plan and perform a task.My main complain as a metal gear comes from the way the story is structured and told. I would say metal gear games have always been story driven games\, meaning you play them more to see the next cutscene or codec conversation than because the gameplay is funny. The player was usually given a small chuck of story quite often.  This is where MGSV fails in my opinion. The developers have given in to today’s game industry idea of an open world game both for the good stuff (as I mentioned above) and the bad. Basically\, they’ve put an obscene amount of side missions and that affects a lot the rhythm of the story. Some people will say “I don’t understand the complaint\, the side ops are optional\, just play the story missions if you don’t like it”; normally I’d agree with that but for you to see all cutscenes and the real good ending you’ll necessarily have to spend a lot of time doing secondary stuff. Basically\, some side ops need to be done to trigger specific cutscenes and\, also\, you need a lot of materials to improve mother base and make some cutscenes and ending stuff available. Only way to do this is playing online or doing side ops. Anyway\, that means I found myself playing for days without getting any new piece of story information because I needed materials and stuff to unlock story stuff. Summarising\, you want to see the whole story?\, you’ll have to spend quite a lot of time doing pointless secondary stuff\, it is not optional if you want to see everything. Now\, the secondary mission stuff gets even worse and I’ll explain why. Some games\, let’s say mass effect or dragon age\, also have a lot of secondary missions; good thing about those games is that the side stuff usually has a context\, mini-stories that motivate you to do it and maybe give you small pieces of nice\, but not essential\, info about the game’s universe. Well\, MGSV fails quite badly again in this. There is only a very limited variety of missions in MGSV\, maybe 6-7 different kinds of missions and these are repeated like 15-20 times. For example\, one kind of mission is “free the prisoner” and there is around 15 of those and they are virtually identical\, only thing that changes is the location of the prisoner. There are no context for the side ops whatsoever  (for most a them\, a few of them are actually story related but maybe only 5-10%)\, so\, for me when I’ve done the exact same thing 12 times\, it gets tedious.I’m not saying this is a bad game\, it is decent and there are a lot of things to enjoy in it\, but as a metal gear it is disappointing. As I said this is mainly related to the fact that you are forced to “farm” a lot in order to see the whole story. If you want to see the whole thing this game will probably take you between 60 and 100 hours to beat of which 70-80% will be pointless repetitive farming. In the end it is worth it just to see how Kojima explained/closed the story of the series\, but be ready to potentially get bored quite a bit with the side ops.… Expand",true

The game runs at 60fps and there are little to no glitches or bugs even when the combat gets intense and you have choppers and tanks and soldiers with explosions and activity all around the screen - the game remains smooth but I enjoyed the gameplay of MGS4 (particularly the first two Acts) and MGS3 over this game.In MGSV\, you are just doing a bunch of missions which mostly feel similar. You are not put in intense circumstances where you use different tactics to get out of situations. There is some of that but the world is designed so that your gameplay/combat section is only limited to an outpost area and to avoid detection\, all you have to do is simply run away from that area since it's open world. Add also the fact that now you have the Fulton system and no longer need to hide bodies. The game is just way too easy and lacks challenge. The only way you can make it challenging is by intentionally making it harder to play by limiting the number of helpful items/gadgets you carry\, turning off reflex (slow motion when you get spotted) and Fulton but the game gives me no incentive to do that. It's like with Hitman - the game gives you many ways to kill your targets\, including many fun\, interesting\, secret ways you can find to complete your objectives but why would I bother if I can just go up and shoot the target and walk away just as easily. It makes everything else pointless. There is no reason to try different approaches.This made me realize just how much better the other Metal Gear games were. The gadgets and items in them weren't just for show\, they served a purpose. They were fun to use and when the game got very challenging they were useful. The wide open areas of MGS4 were worth exploring because there was always something different going on around them like I remember just how many different ways you could get to your objective in MGS4's Act 2. I felt those games provided much more freedom despite being linear when compared to MGSV which is open world. Oh and did I mention that MGSV's world is COMPLETELY EMPTY! There's nothing else to do. There are no towns\, cities or any places full of people. The majority of the game takes place in Afghanistan and you never even meet a single Afghan except for some one translator who I believe you have to rescue but he never talks! This makes it feel like just another artificial video game setting instead of an actual living breathing place.This game had so much potential. It could have easily been the best game ever made but it was unfortunately rushed I believe. The $30-40 demo called Ground Zeroes that was released before this didn't help things either and just left us all with a bad taste. I also thought they promised they were gonna let those of us who bought GZ visit Camp Omega in TPP. But nothing. I also thought that we would be able to build our own Metal Gear like in Peace Walker and they even hint at that but nothing. Mother Base was another huge disappointment. It's just as empty as the sandbox. I could go on and on. Fun game but I expected much more.… Expand",true

The opening is puzzling\, interesting and quite nightmarish\, and it really introduces people to the Metal Gear universe and Kojima's wild imagination and style. From there\, you build up your Mother Base under a new PMC called Diamond Dogs and take revenge on Skullface. But to best honest with you\, If you are a newcomer to the Metal Gear Solid franchise\, or even a fan who hasn't bought the game yet\, I would not recommend you buy this game for the story. If you wanna buy it for the perfect and expertly-crafted stealth mechanics\, go ahead. But do not buy this game if you want to enjoy a great story because you will not find one here. Why? A few reasons. 1. Kojima being bored of making MGS games. He has been forced by Konami to continually make them\, and felt he had to because he couldn't find anyone who could succeed him\, and the one person who could\, died of cancer. No joke. So\, with MGSV Kojima decided to focus only on making a good STEALTH game\, and barely gave any interest to the story. 2. Konami mucking around and getting needlessly involved with Kojima Productions' development process\, which caused chunks of the game to be unfinished when they shouldn't have been. 3. Konami pushing the game out the door when the story wasn't truly finished. So there. You can find heaps of videos and comments on YouTube criticizing the game's plot. I'll repeat myself one more time to hit the nail through the plank of wood. Do not buy this game for the story. Overall\, MGSV is a great stealth action game but has a lackluster story\, which Is a shame because MGS has always espoused great stories. But I guess It's a testament to what happens if a man is forced to make something he was finished with decades ago.

Sneaking feels natural and fluid. Choosing the silent approach will often lead to a cleaner outcome\, but you may miss out on some of the loot you can pick up by clearing out all the enemies (although that can absolutely be done in total stealth it's easier to go guns blazing) The weapons and gadgets make you feel suitable bad ass as you take people out James Bond style.The story is what you would expect from a Metal Gear game although vastly bigger in scale than any other games in the series. There's also a new voice actor for Snake\, Kiefer Sutherland\, who adds a stronger foundation and nuance to the character than ever before.The larger than life characters\, large scale set pieces and enormous open world areas all add to the vastness. Not to mention your home base which can be sizable in scale and population in itself if you're willing to put the effort in to expanding it and fultoning enemy soldiers\, who can be turned to fight for your cause.The sound design is exceptional in general\, although you may get a little bored of certain lines you'll hear over and over from your helicopter pilot or from Kaz.The open world also gives this game a totally different approach to missions. Everything is now episodic in nature rather than linear like the past games. You can approach missions and side missions in whichever order you choose. This is both a blessing and a curse\, because as much fun as it is\, it does somewhat disjoint the story slightly as you'll be heading back and forth to your helicopters mobile base of operations or Mother Base after most missions. But its the nature of the beast with the open world structure. It does mean that it can become a little repetitive over time. but if you can see through that\, there is an exceptional piece of story telling here. I wont spoil the story as it's something better experienced first hand. But it's the best story in the franchise and will make you think about it long after its over.there's a ton of replayability here too as you can replay any completed mission to get an S-Rank and unlock extra XP and items.This was Hideo Kojimas unfortunate goodbye to a character he has developed and grown for most of his career\, it's sad that it's come to an end\, but I can't think of a better send off.

Most of the time\, you can control the pacing of the action\, with a wide range of methods\, weapons\, etc to approach every mission - truly a tactical-action sandbox.2. Graphics are indeed next-gen level\, even better than a number of games released in 2017.3. Controls and movement transitions are smooth and perfect.4. Mother Base management is a class by itself.5. Sounds\, background music\, and \""sound track\"" are great\, though I have other subjective preferences for the latter.6. The choice of conflict zones is very relevant and logical to the cold war era in the 1980s.7. By itself\, the story is deep\, dark\, and psychological (such as Mission 43)\, with an intriguing espionage aspect (such as Zero's ruse). However\, though story was great\, it was not well presented. The insights are not spoon-fed to the player\, everything is not revealed in between cutscenes either through dialogues and flashbacks. The player has to manually listen to the cassette tapes\, which you'll usually do at a time when it has diminished relevancy to the immediate story. Lastly\, that phantom episode should have been ours to experience.Bottom line: this game is a true masterpiece\, a near-perfect creation except for the story presentation\, and all other issues that players and reviews can come up with are just subjective matters.… Expand",true

We've learned that he can't do a checkpoint or base. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain was waiting. The more she appeared not only on the console from Sony. The prequel Ground Zeroes gave a good seed. We've been getting a typical representative games for srubaniya money on the popularity of the franchise. Our expectations\, scandal Kojima with Konami resulted in an overestimation of both users and the press.Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain begins with a beautiful prologue. Hideo kojima is directing great videos. All the movies in the game is executed perfectly. After the prologue the expectations of the user on top\, but then starts grindilka long hours in 100 (it at whom as). After a brilliant prologue and maybe the first mission to rescue Miller\, begins an aimless romp in the sandbox. Many pointless and uninteresting additional missions diluted the plot. But the story missions sometimes are neither setting nor plot development. Rollers we all will indulge rarely. Buying this game you agree not to plot an adventure\, not to play the movie with long rollers\, and at long romp in the open world. The situation worsens more and that this open world (Afghanistan and Africa) completely empty and completely hostile. There is nothing but empty spaces and enemy bases.The game is really good. This is the best of STEL action in an open world! You have many opportunities to perform tasks. It is a pity that if you go through the game quietly\, the arsenate will be only a tranquiliser gun. The lethal Arsenal of weapons is very extensive. Various gadgets are also set. With them\, the game becomes infinitely replayable sandbox. Also\, you have 4 partners: horse\, cute dog\, dog\, d-walker\, and sexy sniper Quiet. Each of the companions useful in their own way: with the horse's help you'll overcome the game miles\, the dog will mark enemies and kill them\, d-walker is generally a mini tank\, a Quiet is to eliminate targets from afar.Those who will play Phantom Pain for the sake of the plot and stunning commercials will be disappointed. This game is about gameplay. Despite the fact that the story missions in the game a lot (50 pieces)\, but most can be written in extra\, since there won't be anything interesting. They themselves do a few story missions are really good and are accompanied by stunning videos. But those missions are few (not more than 15\, I think). Most of the story details we learn by listening to tapes\, which is too much.In addition to performing the repetitive missions in the open world\, we will equip our database (from people to animals). It's not very exciting\, and extremely repetativly process.Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\, unfortunately\, does not deserve all these great ratings and positive reviews. This is the best prohodnyak. Go and forget. If you want to re-again\, you would have to do all of these monotonous effects\, to get to the plot. The game is like this not because of Kojima. It is already clear that Konami just welded on the famous brand. Kojima can understand. It is impossible to force to make a good creative product. And the story he had to suck from a finger\, so at least something was. However\, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain remains the best stealth action game in an open world. If you want to perform monotonous missions and play with the local sandbox\, the game for you. Once the game you need to enjoy rare clips and great replayability sandbox.… Expand",true

The game can be payed in the classic stealth style or as an all out action game. I Like using a bit of both\, but due to my lack of skill in stealth games I often end up having to shoot my way out of a situation.One of my favorite features is the Fulton device that allows you to attach people\, animals and vehicles to a balloon that shoots them up into the sky and takes them to mother-base (a tactical base that you build up during the game). The Fulton is often useful and can be hilarious when extracting animals.Metal gear V feels more like an RPG (which is my favorite genre)\, the open world sandbox feels perfect for the stealth genre and imo makes metal gear a much better game for it. The world is nicely designed and graphically very pleasing on the eyes. Sometimes it felt a little empty (in terms of life) but that that didn't distract to much. The missions so far have been exciting and the amount of weapons\, tools\, items and buddies you can create make them varied each time you play a new mission.The soundtrack is fantastic\, being an 80's kid it really appeals with songs like A-ha Take Me On and electro versions of Man Who Sold The World make for great songs to roam the Afghan desert.The story is intriguing and at times quite scary like you're playing a horror game. The opening really is disturbing and sets the story up in a fantastic way. Gone are the extra long (and again imo) unnecessary cut-scenes that put me off previous metal gear games. The cut-scenes are much more relevant and few\, they add more intrigue to what is happening giving you more reason to play on.I'm only maybe 10 hours in so I only scraped the surface but I can safely say this is a very very good game and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.… Expand",true

84608,MGSVTPP,2015-10-05,9,"By far a GOTY contender\, but here's the hard truth it's somewhat disappointing. That's not really saying much because it's still great and this little 'critique' is just that\, a focus on many of the negatives with few positives\, and there are a lot of negatives but compared to the positives there minor. First off the story isn't what (at least I expected)\, I was expecting Big Boss maybe meeting his match with Skull Face who pushes Boss to his breaking point by making him question who to trust \,as he places sleeper agents destroying you from the inside out. Forcing Snake to make drastic changes into becoming a more misunderstood anti-hero even by his own men\, who begin questioning his leadership when he's making outrageous decisions making more of them betray him\, but Skull Face using you by blaming everything on Zero so you'll fight against him and when this is found it is too little too late as now the entire world is against Diamond Dogs who change them selves into Outer Heaven. That's what I expected\, what I got was downright a poorly paced story that ends too quickly. Gameplay wise this is the best in the series since MGS3\, MGS4 didn't really have a satisfying sneaking system since it seemed combat was everywhere and they kept giving you cool gadgets that are lethal. Here however you can choose your own play style and no matter what you'll be satisfied\, levels or environments are intelligently made to approach stealthily and it's amazing to have the feeling of completing a main mission with no detection or kill satisfying. And it becomes more amazing when the game intelligently makes it harder for you by studying your behavior and setting up 'barriers' (i.e. claymore placed on routes you take when sneaking\, or combat armor on soldiers if your too violent) making it so you have to experiment more with different items that you research\, and if becomes too difficult for you\, you can send combat units from your staff to stop an enemy line of supply (send them on a mission to destroy supplies for mines and if successful you won't see mines for while).Here's the bad parts though: the online system is terrible\, until MGO3 is released the FOB system is absurd and forced. FOBs are basically other player's Mother Base that you can either support (meaning you'll stop any invaders) or invade them stealing staff and resources\, cool concept like the Souls' series invasion system\, but just executed poorly. FOBs don't serve any grand purpose other than to increase the number of staff you can have and let you deploy 2 more combat units so in total you would get 4 which is basically all you need\, getting more staff increases their unit level but after level 50 there's nothing to research that requires say a level 73 R&D team. And unlike the Souls' invasion there's no way to 'opt' out\, once you have an FOB built (forced on you) everything is saved and can be stolen so the next time you log in you'll lose those resources\, only way to ignore this is not to log in but when you do you'll lose perhaps all your resources impacting the main game. Other design decisions I also have to question (spoilers ahead...)You get buddies that help you in missions and in free roam one of these is Quiet\, now I'm not going to obsess over what she wears because I don't care only thing I can really say is the excuse for her to wear what she wears is poor if they didn't say anything I would of ignored it but anyway\, Quiet is extremely useful and became one of my most used buddies since she'll scout enemies at outposts and give you ammo resupplies\, but out of nowhere she'll leave... Forever. Even though you invested perhaps a million GMP into her weapons making her feel like an essential part of your team and when she leaves it just feels like an empty hollow feeling near the end of the game too\, which by then I didn't feel like picking up the game again. Which adds to no real replay value once you S rank all the missions and complete all optional tasks there's no point of playing the game again\, nothing like a NG+ mode\, once it's done it's done. And that's how I felt at the end with the story portion an empty disappointing feeling\, the gameplay filled this void but once that's done there's not much left. I can only guess the game was rushed by Konami and Kojima couldn't finish what he started and now he can't.… Expand",true

I would honestly say that even if you haven't played any MGS games this is still worth your time and money.  Kojima found a way to make resource gathering a lot of fun.  I have been in several situations where I didn't have time to properly play certain missions\, I could still hop on for a few minutes to gather all necessary resources to upgrade me base of operations and develop new weapons.  With hundreds of different weapons\, a respectable amount of different tools\, and vehicles TPP gives you the opportunity to experiment with several different play styles\, and THOUSANDS of different ways to complete missions.  I believe this helps the game stay \""fresh\"".  One thing I noticed about this game which imo is super underrated is the A.I.  Your enemies are super smart.  After a while you will see enemies start to adapt to your certain play style.  For instance\, if you clear out an enemy camp by shooting each one of them in the head with the tranq gun\, the next time you visit a camp they will be wearing helmets.  There are several other factors as well but I don't want to give too much away.

Yes\, the story isn't quite up to the standard of previous Metal Gear games\, but I genuinely enjoyed the majority of the narrative. People lament the change in voice actors for Snake for a reason. Kiefer Sutherland is woefully noncommittal in his delivery. He has barely any lines\, the majority of which are in the optional audio tapes which aren't for everyone\, and even feel kinda like compensation for the bare bones script. The absurd melodramatic charm that MGS is known for remains intact\, in my opinion\, with characters like Kazuhira Miller and Ocelot actually fitting their roles and giving it more passion. Even the exaggeratedly irritating Hal Emmerich does a better job than Snake\, which is a disappointing irony. All in all\, there's lots of room for improvement.The consensus on gameplay seems to be that it's nearly flawless\, and almost always a blast. The sheer level of interactivity between environment\, equipment\, enemy\, and player is ludicrous. The enemy AI is extremely complex\, not always perfect\, but better than most games' AI. Environments will get samey. No matter how you look at it\, this game has a repetitive open world. Admittedly\, there are plenty of gorgeous moments\, and it's hard not to appreciate the feeling of being in the middle of a sandstorm\, or the imposing presence of a Metal Gear before you.The cutscenes are very different from most other games\, with bizarre angles and camera movement\, almost as if to give the sense that a person is recording everything\, scrambling left and right\, and then suddenly gliding through the air or across the ground to give you a better look at a menacing villain. A unique cinematic presentation\, when it chooses to be.My major gripes are with many of the game's design choices\, which border on idiotic. For instance\, the development times for equipment become rather obscene after a certain point\, which really tested my patience\, considering the player already had to accumulate the resources\, upgrade the base\, and recruit all the staff necessary to even develop the items in the first place. Got an S-rank on all the missions? Congratulations\, here's your super cool skin for all your efforts\, you only have to wait two and a half hours before you actually get to wear it.The game gradually becomes more of a grind as you go on. This is perhaps the biggest flaw of the game. Eventually the climax of the story feels unreasonably distant\, even though you've poured hours and hours into the story\, there's always one more lousy design choice for you to get used to\, one more hoop to jump through.This is enough to deter people from the game\, and I don't blame them. This game had the potential to be a masterpiece\, but instead is just 'solid' (I'm sorry\, I had to). I would give this game an 8 or a 9 because of how much I enjoyed it\, but it's just too flawed for me to be that generous. It's funny\, because I got so much mileage out of this game that it seems backwards to give it a 7\, but for every great gameplay or cinematic moment\, it felt there were hours of tedious chores to waste one's time. I'd give it a 7.5 if the rating system allowed it.TL;DR a mixed bag with equal parts spectacular and infuriating elements.… Expand",true

I have played for 60 hours and only just got to another area besides Afghanistan. Although I have been doing stealth\, getting S Ranks\, doing all of the Side Ops\, have a massive amount of resources and replayed missions I have done\, that's still a massive amount of time. I guess that this game will easily take me over 100 hours to get 100%.There is just so much to do. Fultoning soldiers\, developing Mother Base\, developing new equipment\, managing your staff\, messing around in free roam\, etc.The graphics are excellent. The game uses the incredible Fox Engine that has some of the best lighting I have seen in a game. At times\, it can look photo-realistic\, while running at 60fps and extremely rarely dropping frames. The textures are much improved compared to Ground Zeroes\, you can hardly tell this game is cross-gen.Animations are very professional. Not only are they realistic looking\, (like Snake climbing realistically)\, they don't sacrifice control for realism. (The Witcher 3 feels so bad to control compared to this game.) The controls are fantastic. The only complaint I have would be the cover system\, sometimes Snake will go where you don't want him to.It can be difficult as well. Not so much combat-wise\, but if you want to stealth and get S Ranks you have to take a lot of things into account. For example\, enemies will wise up and wear helmets eventually\, which make getting tranquilizer head shots harder. Patrols on missions can make moving around less easy. Snipers will make you have to crawl.The game gradually gets more difficult. It starts off slow and you keep getting more and more abilities to use - this is one of the game's best points. You aren't thrust into a world of craziness straight away. In a way\, it fits Snake's 9 year coma perfectly. You get more and more used to the war that is going on\, back to your best.I probably haven't had as much fun with a stealth game since Hitman: Blood Money. As a stealth sandbox game\, it is nearly perfect. There are many ways to complete missions with different loadouts.The sound design is impressive. The dynamic original score\, the sound effects\, the voice acting\, all are great.If you are a big fan of stealth games\, and if you liked GTA: Vice City's soundtrack\, this is the game for you. Hall and Oates\, Spandau Ballet\, Billy Idol\, the soundtrack on cassette tapes you get matches the 1984 setting perfectly.This is still a Metal Gear Solid game\, however. There are plenty of humorous things you can do. minor gameplay spoilers: (using horse poop to spin a guard's vehicle out of control\, the cardboard box\, luring guards with girl posters on the cardboard box\, etc.)Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions have gone out with a bang. This game is meticulously crafted\, with subtlety\, minor details you wouldn't expect to find in an AAA game\, attention to detail\, freedom of gameplay\, cinematic storytelling (the directing in the cutscenes is great.)\, incredible engine\, making 60fps a priority. There are a massive amount of things to praise.However\, there is one big problem with the game. The narrative\, and the pacing. You no longer have 30 minute cutscenes like the previous games\, and codec calls. You have cutscenes that aren't nearly as long\, and cassette tapes you can listen to which fill in a lot of details. There are a lot of cassette tapes\, which are longer than the cutscenes themselves.You can go for hours and hours without the story being moved forward. and when it is moved forward\, it isn't by much.This isn't a massive issue though\, because the gameplay is so great.One of the best games of all time.… Expand",true

The first MGS i played was MGS 4.Note: I haven't played ground zero.This review will be split into 2 parts because the game is split into 2 very different chapters and major quality in gameplay differences.I think the major difference between quality of gameplay is solely because of the internal feud between Hideo Kojima (the series director and creator) and Hojima (the production company) falling out and break up during development of MGS:V. Also please note this is fully my speculation.If I rated the game solely on Chapter 1 I would give the game a 8/10 rating. But rating chapter 2 my rating falls to 2/10.Chapter 1: 8/10:In the beginning the game is fun\, the story is good and engaging. The gameplay is exciting and new. The cutscenes are awesome. The only drawback of giving the game the perfect score is that it is slightly repetitive. The side missions (side ops) consist of 5 missions rehashed 157 or so times at different locations. Don't let the 157 side missions number fool you. It's just a number and gimmick to put on the box.The locations also get boring pretty quickly\, i knew nothing of the game before playing it so i was expecting various locations but this game mostly features sandy locations in afganistan and africa. Africa and Afganistan look the same for the most part and are a lazy created location.The AI is decent\, they do adapt to your playstyle but are dumb nontheless. Eventually you will get to a point where the AI will snipe you with a shotgun from 300m away and my only deaths were caused by close range shotguns. Even a direct mortar hit didn't kill me.Controlling snake gets annoying at times\, he has troubles climbing over the thousands of small rocks scattered all over afganistan and africa.Tanks you drive will get stuck hitting some small bushes and little rocks which makes driving them not as fun as you'd imagine.But other than all those cons chapter 1 main missions are very enjoyable and put together. The game feels engaging at this moment and you want to better your army\, upgrade items and continue doing the same side missions.Chapter 2:I think this is where someone else took the reigns from Hideo Kojima.The game takes a huge nose dive in quality of gameplay. It solely feels like they just made a chapter 2 to extend the overall game time. The story feels different a new. You don't really care about anything happening in this storyline.A ridiculous mission unlocking system where you are forced to do a number of side missions to progress in the story. Which would be fine if they weren't the same rehashed side missions you did 100+ times in Chapter 1The main story missions are lazyily designed\, boring and some are just baffling. Number 45 mission\, without revealing anything is probably one of the worst missions in a single AAA title I have played in the last 6 years.During the missions I just couldn't comprehend how it was the same game I played earlier in the first chapter.Here I completely stopped doing the extra tasks and made it my mission to end the game asap. I honestly couldn't do it\, my breaking point was mission 45\, yes 1 mission before the ending. I got so bored of this ridiculous mission I rather go on youtube and watch Furious Don play it.Now I haven't touched the online bit and I won't as I've already sold my copy of the game to someone but I hear it has microtransactions which are mostly pay to win.Someone really dropped the ball on this game and could have made it one of the best games ever.Who should buy it?Hardcore MGS fans.People who can wait a couple months and buy this for $40. It's fun for about 10-15 hours. Depending how long chapter 1 takes you.

So much mission variety\, and the gameplay organically makes its own sense of creativeMetal Gear Solid V is a strange game to review. I love it so dearly\, yet I am severely disappointed with it at the same time. It's one of the polarizing games I've ever played.At first I was in love with it\, the story direction was a dark a unique twist for the series\, and the gameplay is fantastic. So much mission variety\, and the gameplay organically makes its own sense of creative fun. So many different ways to approach a scenario... that is for about 30-40 hours.The game offers 157 side missions and 50 main missions\, which took me like 50+ hours just to get through most of. I still have another 40 side missions left to do. The grind gets insane. I feel like open world/sandbox games should be of a certain length\, normally 28-32 hours is a good run for an open world game. This game takes 50+\, and it overstays its welcome for me.I found the side missions to become a ridiculous chore\, as they were cut/copy/paste 157 times over\, meaning you go to every single outpost and camp to do a different goal. You get to know the 2 open worlds very well\, because you will be grinding content in them for a long time. What's sad is when a side op takes you where the story will later go\, so now you're familiar with all the hidden secrets\, and the area doesn't feel new when the story goes to that place.The story is another matter. It is convoluted\, yet barely even there. Big Boss rarely talks to give the \""silent protagonist\"" feel\, which was a horrible decision in my opinion\, as he is already a developed and incredible character. The cutscenes were almost all shown off in the trailers for the game\, and some of the really impressive and mysterious moments in the trailers were not as impressive in the context of the game.The story as a whole just feels cheap\, and underwhelming. Without talking about spoilers\, I will say that the ending is really poor. In fact\, chapter 2 as a whole is just bad.Metal Gear Solid V is separated by two chapters\, chapter 1 runs through mission 31\, and I quite enjoyed that part of the game's story. The cutscene direction is really good\, the only real problem I have is the pacing of the story is crazy slow.  However\, chapter 1 leads into a totally underwhelming \""chapter 2\"" which contains only 3 or so unique story missions.  And only 1 of those missions is remotely interesting (it's actually the most impactful mission in the game and I love it).  The \""ending\"" is cut off.  The entire chapter 2 feels like Kojima directed some cutscenes\, and was fired before finishing the second half of the game\, so Konami dumped a bunch of padding in.In chapter 2\, almost all of the main story missions are \""challenge modes\"" of past missions\, and they're so lazy that they even have you watch all of the old cutscenes as if they're happening for the first time.  These missions are fine if they were optional\, but they are required.In the end\, the gameplay and story missions of MGS V are a mixed bag between masterful\, tons of fun\, and a total grind.  If the story was planned better\, and didn't fall apart in chapter 2\, and if there wasn't LOADS of padding\, I would give this game a 9 or 10 depending on how well it was handled. But I don't think this game needed to be the bloated mess that it turned out to be.  All in all\, I had a good time as far as my enjoyment for a videogame goes\, but as a Metal Gear game... I wanted a lot to be different or better.My score varies during moments of the game\, so it lands in a range of 6-8.5\, so I'll just give it a 7.… Expand",true

As a self professed huge Metal Gear Solid fan (seriously guys I have every game\, as well as put over 500 hours into each) I must say that I was massively excited for this game. I have never been more excited for anything in my life. They day it came out was euphoric for me\, I could not believe that the day had finally come where I would not only get another Metal Gear Solid\, but the final Metal Gear Solid. I was expecting massive story which would be highly emotional and mind-bending. I was expecting a gigantic world with smooth gameplay\, and a game which is overall fun and a masterpiece... and you know what\, thats exactly what I got.GameplayIt goes without saying that the gameplay is the best in the series. This is the only part of the game that everyone agrees on. The game feels so smooth it must be illegal. The shooting from all guns feels firm like a real gun\, but light making it easy to shoot. The sneaking feels like you are in your own movie and most of the time the mission will play out like a grand action sequence in a movie where you are the star. Everything ties together and feels magnificent. There isn't much more to say other than\, this game is worth it's 60 dollars alone for how fun it is and there is so much content on top of that. I can easily see myself putting hundreds of hours into it. As a final statement on the gameplay\, I must say I felt completely in control the entire time. These grand action sequences were on par with something like Uncharted's scenes of grand mayhem and cinematic glory\, except\, in Metal Gear Solid V\, the scenes were because of my choices\, and my choices would have to get me out. This is something extraordinary which I have never seen a game do before. Suffice to say gameplay blew me away.StoryThis is the controversial one\, the one that some people makes or breaks the game. For me\, it made it. At first I was very disappointed at how after that glorious opening\, the cutscenes calmed down and frankly left me without a story for about 3 hours. I almost hated it for what had happened\, I almost gave this game a 7/10\, but the game's story started to kick up dust again\, and it was glorious. The games story really start to rank up at the end of the first part of Afghanistan\, most people say there are less cutscenes and subsequently less story\, but this is simply not true. If you look at the amount of cutscenes altogether\, its the same as something like MGS 3 but just more spread out since the game is longer\, and the story is not told as much through cutscenes (which are beautiful by the way) and more through audio peaces after missions telling you what happened and cassette tapes which give that famous MGS dialogue and deliver gut punching revelations. Some people think this was a stupid way of doing but I disagree. Yes I miss the extremely cinematic cutscenes but this new way of doing it makes it so if you don't like cutscenes and are new to the MGS franchise\, you are not burdened with a huge amount of them\, and the cassette tapes can be listened to while on long horseback rides giving you insight into the story while you ride. And the twist\, oh the twist\, it is game changing and it will make you scratch your head while you ponder it.ToneThe tone is extremely dark while keeping that signature Metal Gear silliness. It as always\, handles heavy topics like child soldiers with grace. Sometimes the more serious moments make the silly moments seem a little to silly but this is the case with every Metal Gear game.ConclusionThe game is presented very cleanly and feels and looks incredible if any game deserves praise it is this one. This game is incredible in every way and deserves your money.10/10… Expand",true

Just as any game does. So I'm be afraid to sport some in this.MGSV: The Phantom Pain is easily my favorite Metal Gear Solid\, and that's a hard **** statement to make Because I played MGS 4 and MGS 3 multiple times over just to experienceFirst Off let me start off this Review by saying I am A Huge MGS Fan but I do not limit myself to saying that all the games in the series have flaws. Just as any game does. So I'm be afraid to sport some in this.MGSV: The Phantom Pain is easily my favorite Metal Gear Solid\, and that's a hard **** statement to make Because I played MGS 4 and MGS 3 multiple times over just to experience them again. What makes it great? Beautiful graphics\, Great Characters and Voice acting\, Very in depth gameplay and so so so so much to do. All without the inclusion of the Online mode\, which based off other games\, will be equally as fun and addicting.Story - I love everything about MGS Storylines. The humor\, the serious notions\, the way it plays into real life history and puts it's own spin on it. It's all very clever and intriguing. You can't knock MGS for going over the top every now and then because hey\, that's Kojima for you\, he's weird. And lets be honest\, most games coming out of Japan have a very weird characteristics\, so seeing mechs in 1984 is actually pretty damn tame. Everything making a kojima game is all there\, the overlaying themes\, the question raisers\, emotional moments\, there's hardly anything you won't love SLIGHT \""IMPACT\"" SPOILER STOP READING IF YOU WANT TO AVOID. I won't spoil anything too much\, but something within the story occurs as a big twist MGS games are all known for\, and it will either make you say \""wow that was ballsy\"" and blow your mind or completely make you go What the **** that's so dumb. If you've seen the trailers you already have a slight idea\, and early on you get a hell of a lot of moments making you say \""could it be...?\"" If you beat the game you know what I'm on about. Overall I PERSONALLY loved the story\, and understand some fans complaints but it's really being picky in all honesty\, but I would've loved the long cutscenes MGS is known for. Created a void for me personally\, but you get those cutscenes in the form of casette tapes ala Peace walker\, that you listen to in order to fill in story gaps you have questions for. Something too many people overlook and ruin their experience with.Gameplay - THE BEST\, YES THE BEST I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF PLAYING. Why? Because I can do things in so many different ways\, I actually get overwhelmed in thinking what to do. Here\, is where SO **** MANY PEOPLE\, and getting wrong with this game. All the negative opinions I've seen that aren't just **** idiots being trolls or just being idiots\, are underwhelming every aspect of the gameplay. Either they just go in full stealth with no variety\, or guns blazing\, and leave it at that. And yes\, you can boil it down to that\, but there so many ways for you to go about it\, so many entry points and manners of infiltration that had me thinking \""well night-time would be better because these guards will be asleep\, but then I can't see the most important ones unless I choose quiet to scout\, but then I lose the mobility of D-horse\, or D-walker's ability to..\"" That's what I mean. There's so many layers to combat\, and everything\, down to day and night\, weather patterns\, Guard Patrol Patters\, Truck arrival times\, Guard meetups\, Guard shifts\, **** even the position of their HEAD matters. Everything is purposeful and every weapon and tactic you employ is rewarding when done right\, and even if things don't go to plan it's a **** joy to get out of a sticky situation. Cons? Well the \""open world\"" is more like a big sandbox to go and tackle certain guard posts. There's NO civilian life whatsoever\, which makes the world feel dead and barren at times. It is a big flaw but in fairness\, it's a desert and jungle War-zones\, so you don't expect to see civilians\, but it would've been nice to have in there and could've added to gameplay. Enemies at the start are stupidly easy\, but that's to get you used to the game and mechanics\, and they quickly ramp up their difficulty after the first \""tutorial\"" modes.Graphics + Sound - The game is downright gorgeous to look at. With some slightly low res textures in some areas that were understandable\, almost everything comes out crisp and looking great\, with great\, and I mean GREAT draw distance for console games\, and looks **** awesome on PC. The lighting\, the character models\, the animations\, the weapon detail\, the designs of EVERYTHING are so well done. Admittedly some of the enemies may have repeats in design in the same area\, but there's enough variety\, and really\, what more can you do with enemy types\, this isn't a world like The Witcher or Elder Scrolls. Sound as well was incredible. with noise being a key factor to finding out certain things in the environment and how enemies react towards your actions. the voice acting is great.  If you're unfamiliar to MGS games\, the anime at times sounding voice work will come off forced or over the top but that's nothing new to MGS. You learn to love it.GOTY.

I'm a real stickler for realistic horses in games and the horse here is very well done. In fact\, in many ways it feels a lot like the horse from SotC\, especially when you break off into a gallop and the wind rushes by your ears.The desert tundra filled with rocky escarpments is brilliantly realised\, with a dazzling array of gameplay choices on offer. The controls feel tight\, if a little bit janky with a couple of strange button choices and not really much customisation options (typical MGS fare\, I guess\, but it's a bit jarring after playing other slick third person games like TLoU). But it's the gameplay that's key here and it's got bucket-loads. It's just so much fun sizing up camps and outposts from the hills then sneaking in to steal gear\, materials and personnel to send back to Motherbase for development. This element is superb\, and easily as fun as base management in X-COM E.U. The sheer array of available research projects and upgrades is incredible and being able to physically watch the base expand and develop is highly satisfying. This is where the game actually races ahead of it's peers. Not only are we dealing with an almost open world here\, with a similar level of mechanics to the very best third person games\, but we're also getting a giant metagame on top which feeds into the experience in the form of Motherbase. The fact that this game performs at a rock solid 60fps on consoles is the cherry on the top and is almost mystical. To my mind\, it really does set the bar very high for current gen.Personally\, I absolutely loved Peace Walker and I disagree that tPP is totally unlike any other MGS game. For me\, it feels like a very natural progression from PW. I know lots of people disliked PW for it's deviation from many MGS tropes. If you did\, then don't just write-off tPP. It's much meatier in the gameplay dept and the corridor missions have been replaced with these vast open zones with total freedom and endless options. I particularly like the fact that you are part conservationist too\, it actually made me chuckle with glee.I don't love MGS games for their story arc\, however\, and for me it's the weakest element of the series. I just think the characters and story haven't matured enough to keep pace with the progression of game mechanics and the entertainment industry as a whole (let alone those fans that have grown up with the series like me). When put in the context of some other games\, films and box sets out there (ahem 24)\, I thought the beginning sequence in tPP felt positively low budget (albeit very shiny and good looking). It's a shame\, because it sets things up in poor stead (in my opinion) and I feel many discerning gamers will just write it off as bollocks and send it to the swap-shop. There IS a damn fine game here buried underneath the waffle and quirky nonsense. I personally feel the series is moving in the right direction by altering the way in which the story takes centre stage\, often at the cost of gameplay. If it was better written and easier to actually follow\, I may feel differently.Snake is a great character\, but the length and breadth of the military-industrialised nature of the series feels seriously at odds with many of the characters\, especially when they start referring to one-another in gravelled action-movie voices as 'Rough Diamond Dogs' and 'Big Boss'. It just comes across as crass and poorly written and doesn't serve well to pastiche those 80's action movies as it would so like to. And for god's sake let me skip a cut scene if I choose\, at the very least on the second visit to it. Jesus.That's my opinion\, anyway\, which I'm sure will rub up heavily against many stalwart fans\, but know that I am a huge fan of MGS also. I just don't think it reached it's full potential in terms of vision. Do buy this game though. Just like playing around in Los Santos\, at the very least it's a tour de force of what highly skilled programmers are capable of. At it's very best it's a superb lone-ranger military stealth game.… Expand",true

Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear series was medium and genre defining\, not only setting a standard for stealth gameplay and mechanics\, but also demonstrating in the early days of the video games industry how cinematic and storytelling techniques could be innovatively used to create powerful and moving stories. Fans around the world were drawn into a rich and at times brilliantly convoluted universe\, populated with characters so three dimensional and likeable that the player finds themselves genuinely caring about their fates. Fates played out in a saga where sub plot and character history are an addictive garnish atop the substantial meat of a philosophically and politically motivated main narrative.The issue with this release is the side lining of the story which has captivated fans for so long\, the lengthy frequent cut scenes and codec conversations that so characterised the series are gone.While Kiefer Sutherland has done a fantastic job other voice actors let the production down and your character is too often mute which becomes jarring\, particularly when something is directly revealed to you and there is no snappy one liner or thoughtful response as there has been in all the other games. As someone who struggled with the series gameplay pre the introduction of Fox Engine in MGS 4 (to the point of playing them on easy mode)\, I can appreciate how there was pressure to match the easy fun style of recent games like GTA V\, Far  Cry 4 and Tomb Raider. Audiences demand a less linear world to explore; they are less forgiving of clunky controls and most desire some RPG style element such as upgrading skills or characters to chart their progression through the game.The Phantom Pain succeeds in bringing this more player friendly style of gameplay\, not only does it run ridiculously well on PC due to the power of Fox Engine\, action and stealth mechanics are greatly improved making both infiltration and a more aggressive approach really fun to play. However the addition of elements such as the development of Mother Base mainly through resource management feels slightly tacked on and dare I say pointless. Though the world is huge and open there isn’t an awful lot to do when travelling between bases or missions\, making a lot of the game a frustrating dash or painstaking crawl between A and B. This would not be so noticeable if the autosave/check pointing system (you cannot manually save) was not so poorly implemented. It is difficult to tell when your game has saved and too often you end up wasting hours redoing missions because the game has bugged and forgotten a checkpoint. While some gameplay is ruined by what would seem very simple fixes\, for example the close quarter combat actions\, buddy attacks and prone are so over powered it ruins the immersion significantly.Kojami has always been an uncompromising auteur and innovator\, possibly one of the most important creative minds of our times. It has been revealed there was great pressure not only to recoup profits on the pushed back release leading to annoyances like micro transactions but also that publishers Konami effectively ripped the story out of the game\, hours of cut scenes were removed and for a year they wouldn’t allow funding for development of effectively anything but the gameplay. Some we will see\, for example a particularly important cut scene was included on the special edition and is surely destined for upload\, but some tragically will probably never reach the eyes of fans.The truth is this release and the mixed reactions of players across the world just goes to proves how when business and creativity come together in the right ways\, as the series has done in the past\, wonderful things can be allowed to develop\, however as with this game when profit margins dictate creative content the result is almost always half-baked\, even with the best material to work with. However\, I think the best way to view the series is not through the lens of this one game\, but rather as we view any iconic saga from Star Wars to James Bond\, it should be viewed as a sum of its parts and judged by enjoyment it has given fans and inspiration it has given to artists. It would be easy to harshly proclaim this game a disservice to fans but in comparison to most commercial premium games it still stands out as a very good game. Kojami put it best when in an interview he said:“When a flower dies it scatters its seeds.

Yes surprisingly the story in this MGS installment takes a bit more of a backseat to the gameplay and provides the most deep and intricate stealth mechanics the entire series has seen.'Metal Gear Solid V - The Phantom Pain' has some of the most enjoyable and notable gameplay in any game of the past few years\, and Kojima's clear dedication to the gameplay in this one is very obvious. Yes surprisingly the story in this MGS installment takes a bit more of a backseat to the gameplay and provides the most deep and intricate stealth mechanics the entire series has seen. Coupled with the smooth and clever gameplay is the integration of Motherbase\, a system seen in 'Metal Gear Solid - Peacewalker'. However unlike MSF\, Diamond Dogs' Motherbase is something I found far more compelling and useful. It was also something I found a lot more real in this installment\, as you can visit and traverse along it. Unfortunately there isn't really a lot to see on Motherbase so most of the time you'll probably be there to shower copious amounts of blood from your body.Along with Motherbase is the new FOB system which uses online server connection to allow you to build another base for more resources and the ability to invade and steal other players' spoils. The invasion system is certainly a fun one but it really gets put down by the inconsistency of the servers and the integration of a free to play economy with microtransactions in an already full retail price game. The servers also affect the loading speed of the single player campaign which basically leads to the online servers being more of a detriment than anything.The story of 'The Phantom Pain' is definitely lacking in a lot of areas and a lot of times led me to believe there should be more where there is little. It also suffers from pacing issues\, which is not uncommon for an open world game to have and it makes some of the game feel a little sparse in terms of plot. The story is generally pretty good but really if anything had more potential than it utilized.Gameplay has felt smoother than ever and with a pretty consistent frame rate of 60fps and striking 1080p resolution\, it really is quite a beautiful game to play. The character animations feel incredibly refined and the core mechanics of the game are the smoothest they've ever been. However there are moments where sometimes terrain is unnecessarily difficult to traverse and small slopes will leave Big Boss\, one of the best soldiers known to man\, struggling and sliding back down. This may sound nit picky but it has actually gotten me spotted a few times and really looks ridiculous when it occurs frequently.The new buddy system is something I rather enjoy in the game and can allow up to 4 options for a partner\, with D-Horse for traversal\, D-Dog for scouting and attacking\, Quiet for sniping and D-Walker.. who I'll be frank never particularly came of use to me but it's pretty cool. I will address the elephant in the room which is Quiet's attire and honestly I really don't like how exploitative the game treats her\, and the reason for her look really doesn't justify why she is dressed like that at all and appears as more of a second thought of her character than the initial idea. Her actual personality and character is truly brilliant which makes it even more disappointing that she is portrayed in an incredibly objectified manner. (Thankfully you can purchase and develop clothes for her later on so there's something at least.)Overall I'd say 'The Phantom Pain' is the best game I've played this year and is a great addition to the series. It has a few flaws but overall puts on a fantastic performance.Pros:Excellent GameplaySuperb Visual Fidelity and PerformanceInteresting plot ideasTons of contentCons:A lacking conclusionMicrotransactionsDisappointing female representationBad online services… Expand",true

As a longtime fan of the Metal Gear Solid franchise I have spent the past 3-4 years tracking the development of this game and hearing almost every news article to come out. Having waited that long\, when I finally got my hands on the game I took my expectation and set the bar really high. From the very beginning mission the game has a deep deep feel for situational discomfort\, you aren't comfortable with that's happening\, but this is done in a way that both excites you and scares you. You don't want to run into an enemy base but you also wonder if there are any diamonds there so you can create a larger Mother Base. It's things like this that really make the game shine as a stealth simulation\, an experience where you actually feel like you are infiltrating something much larger than yourself.What would a Metal Gear Solid game be without it's story? Although at the time I am writing this review I have yet to complete the story\, I have already seen how this story is structured and polished. Some chapters don't matter as much as others\, but they all play a role in where the story is going. Even some of the side ops that aren't part of the main story hold important answers to questions created from previous games\, and some give the player a fun experience that differs from the main story. Along with this incredible story comes the character's that drive them. Big Boss isn't the soldier he used to be\, Kaz Miller isn't the agent he was in 1975\, and Ocelot is definitely not the same as in Snake Eater. Each of these characters play an important role in where this story goes and why this story is happening. With this characters come the voice actors. When I first heard that Kiefer Sutherland would be taking the place as Big Boss I was a bit skeptical\, but after having player 15+ hours of this game I can see exactly why he was chosen. Troy Baker and Robin Atkin Downes both give powerful and emotional performances as Ocelot and Miller\, and both actors put just as much\, if not more\, raw emotion into these characters.Overall\, The Phantom Pain is nothing short of a masterpiece\, something that will be looked upon by gamers in the coming years. If there is a game that reflects the improvement of franchises\, this is the one that should be looked at.… Expand",true

84765,MGSVTPP,2015-09-08,10,"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is without a doubt a modern classic. It is a game that dares to push boundaries and to be truly ambitious where far too many developers and their series are far too comfortable stagnating with each iteration of their respective series. Whether you are a long time fan of the series\, a newcomer\, or even someone who found previous titles in the seriesMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is without a doubt a modern classic. It is a game that dares to push boundaries and to be truly ambitious where far too many developers and their series are far too comfortable stagnating with each iteration of their respective series. Whether you are a long time fan of the series\, a newcomer\, or even someone who found previous titles in the series weren't really your thing\, or just outright disliked them\, I implore you to try this game\, really try it. I say this because it is one of the only instances in gaming history where a series has made such an incredibly and surprisingly massive leap forward\, not only for the series itself\, but more importantly for gaming as a whole. This is the kind of game that sets a standard\, this is the kind of game that's merits can not be simply measured by the sum of it's parts. I can only hope\, and pray that other gamers will look at this game as a shining example of the difference between a game that is produced with true care and creativity\, with ambition behind it and innovation pushing it forward and making it a reality\, and games that are just yearly releases of the same old **** running on dated engines\, with barely any real change save for new maps and a new generic story\, pushed out too early and often buggy and incomplete\, with withheld content planned as DLC's right from the start.Don't get me wrong The Phantom Pain is not a \""perfect game\""  nothing is of course. It has it's fair share of issues\, could have a better fast travel system\, missions could be a bit more varied\, has a few bugs that could be cleared up\, vehicles could have been made to preform better. But overall\, in the grand scheme of what the game offers\, and also compared to the faults of MOST modern games\, it's flaws are negligible at their worst. And that is impressive considering how technically advanced the game is\, the fact that it's on every console and PC barring the Wii/Wii U\, and that it's running on an entirely new engine on unfamiliar consoles. That's almost always a recipe for a whole lot of technical glitches that this game is surprisingly lacking in all things considered.The one really major \""flaw\"" that may turn some people off from this game is how it approaches it's story. Due to the extensive length of the game\, and also due to the fact that it's both a Prequel and a Sequel to a long running timeline (which is a writing nightmare) the game has a relatively slow pace that won't grab a good number of people. This is amplified by the fact that Kojima made a strong attempt at shifting the focus in storytelling to be more action and expression based than dialogue based\, which for any film freaks like myself\, is great. The cinematography is second to none\, but I fully understand how it would be hard for many to really take in. The game does provide exposition in the form of cassette tapes you can play whenever you'd like. But still I can see how the story may not click with a good deal of people. That said it is quite a violent and often times grim game\, so it's great for those who are interested games that are a bit more on the mature side.Gameplay and presentation are where the game really shines though. As the focus has shifted from what was a cut scene heavy series\, MGSV is in nearly every way\, the most amazingly detailed game-play experience yet in gaming\, the beauty behind it is the level of depth in it's mechanics which is what Hideo Kojima is known for\, although it's always been on such a small scale. George Weidman from Super Bunnyhop once said \""If The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim is an ocean that's a foot deep\, the Metal Gear Solid 3\, is the Mariana Trench.\"" Which is something that I would agree with. And now\, Kojima has taken that depth that warranted such a statement and has applied it to an \""ocean\"" of his own\, no longer confined to such a limited scale or game length\, MGSV is one of the very few games where you can do just about anything you could ever want to do and more\, and more importantly\, where it all feels good\, where it's all natural and applicable\, where any choice you make is a valid choice that isn't penalized or ineffective. But what's more it may be the ONLY game I have ever played that grows and adapts to how it's being played and then works to counter it and forces the player to grow and adapt\, all thanks to it's multitude of features that all work in tandem to make each time you replay a mission\, or replay the game unique\, and unpredictable.If you have any doubts about purchasing MGSV\, I implore you to throw caution to the wind and buy this game\, it is without a doubt\, the best game purchase you'll have made in the last decade. And it will serve to send a message to developers that this is the level of quality we expect from our games\, and that we as gamers are done being shoehorned in to only having a steady stream of rehashed bull**** available for us to play. Support quality\, not marketability and profit margins.… Expand",true

All that has come to close as Kojima has left Konami. He leaves his us\, his fans\, with Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain. Regardless of our thoughts on the game\, we should at least respect the work this man has put into his games. He treats Metal Gear as his pride and joy. The effort is seen in the extensive stories and innovation that comes with Metal Gear games. Even today when games seem to enjoy rehashing items\, textures\, designs and mechanics\, Phantom Pain introduces new ideas not seen in games before.Lets start off with the bad things. The open world aspects and your main base (Mother Base) seem to lack consistency. There's not much to do at Mother Base and the open world doesn't have much other than enemy bases. Side Missions can become repetitive and the story is not quite on par with the previous Metal Gear games. Snake barely talks and there's not as many cutscenes. This may not bother other players but fans of the Metal Gear franchise will definitely notice those differences.The gameplay is flawlessly created to provide you with nonstop entertainment. The stealth and enemy placement can be difficult\, but to me that's a good thing. The game is challenging and requires you to use some tactical plans in order to get to your objectives. If you enjoy running down corridors shooting mindlessly at enemies\, this isn't your game. If you expect to just crouch down in a shadow and expect enemies not to see you in other stealth games... this is not the game for you. You must be very careful around enemies.Enemies have been programmed with sufficient AI. They're smart during combat\, observant during stealth and they'll mix up their path every so often. Luckily you have a massive list of different items\, weapons\, tools and support options to handle them. You have to develop your base in order to create better gear. Collecting resources and recruiting team members is vital to your progress. You have the option of being a blood thirsty killer or an honorable soldier who only resorts to killing as a last ditch effort. There are multiple ways to take down enemies without killing. Unlike other games this would usually be done with stealthfully choking out enemies or tranq darts\, which can be kind of boring when you have so many badass guns. In Phantom Pain you can upgrade a lot of your favorite weapons to shoot rubber bullets that will stun enemies and still provide you the fun shoot outs.The open world is set in the deserts of Afghanistan\, you get around by horse or vehicles. It almost feels like a western but with futuristic qualities. You can go it alone or have a support unit help out with missions. Could either be a specialist soldier or D-Dog (Wolf). Online features base fighting\, you can assault online player's bases to steal their resources and players can also assault your base. You'll need to upgrade your bases defense and make sure your army is well equipped. Assaulting player's bases is a lot of fun\, easily my favorite thing about this game.Right off the bat this game throws you into an extremely intense intro. This is one game that does NOT have a slow start. Although the game does have a lot of features that will be locked off till you progress far enough into the game\, this actually makes the experience better. You're constantly being given new things to try out so there's never a dull moment. The graphics and music are breath taking. The game's presentation is incredible\, cinema worthy experience.I know the issues fans have pointed out and I understand\, as a hardcore fan myself\, but look at the current state of games. New games like Resident Evil 5 and 6\, Silent Hill Homecoming and Downpour\, Battlefield 4 and Hardline\, Elder Scrolls Online\, Sonic and Sim City they have all circum to the changes in the mainstream gaming industry. Features and gameplay dwindle as games slowly become less and less challenging. Entire gameplay mechanics are stripped to provide more mass appeal. In this era I can only hope games try to do their best and improve as times go on. Yet they're all taking big steps back and now all we can hope is that a game will be worth their prices. It would have been so easy to take this franchise and turn it into yet another Call of Duty clone. But Kojima cares about his games and fans. He genuinely tries to make a video game masterpiece\, he wouldn't sacrifice quality for money. While it might not be MGS\, Snake Eater or Peace Walker... Phantom Pan is amazing in its own way. Definitely worth buying!Farewell Kojima\, thanks for the awesome games!… Expand",true

It is a bit bare-bones though with most of the story happening in cassette tapes\, its good to listen to them while you're roaming but they just become background noise over time and you miss details. 9.5/10Voice acting: The voice acting is where the game starts to slip\, as most fans of the series know David Hayter was replaced with Kiefer Sutherland which at first made me hesitant about the game because the codex conversations were most of the previous games but Kiefer Sutherland does it well but the main issue is that he barely speaks\, where in the other games Snake/Big Boss would chat until his lips fell off you don't hear more than a few direct words from Big Boss other than a question or a clarification and this can make conversations awkward\, you'll have Ocelot (played by Troy Baker) chat for about half an hour and Snake will just stare with a blank look. Robin Atkin Downs the voice actor for Kazuhira Miller is a voice actor I've heard in several games and deserves more spotlight. 9/10Gameplay: Metal Gear V is probably the most gameplay orientated MGS so far (I haven't played MGS:1\, so I might be wrong) the gameplay is smooth yet challenging but I get the felling that later on in the game as you get better weapons it becomes easy\, for example when you get the silenced sniper rifle you'll never need to get close again and with all the mountains and high places it's easy to get a vantage point. Also with the scoring system I feel pressured to stealth and not kill but there are so many ways to kill people with interrogations and mortars and stuff what they should have done is what Splinter Cell did with different types of scoring systems and if you did a certain amount of things over another you would get scored for that. But other than those little things it is probably one of the best gameplay systems I've ever played. 10/10The world: From what I've seen of Afghanistan I would consider visiting it\, I'm not sure how accurate it is but I think it will be close to real thing\, I've only seen a small area so far though but it is a pretty sight\, I'm glad there is no wait system but instead you have to wait in real time\, there is something about sitting on top of a mountain overlooking an enemy encampment watching for guard patrols and gaps in their patrols it just reminds me of the real thing so much I'm impressed\, The enemy AI is also very unpredictable\, in a good way\, if they see you some will immediately try to shoot you\, some will panic and fumble and some might just ignore you. 10/10Things to do: Despite the epic size of the world there isn't much to do\, there are side ops and missions but outside of that there is only resource collecting and random murder sprees\, there needs to be more in the world to do\, I like the way it's just a playground where you can mess with guards\, blow up towers using Jeeps and so on so forth but that's just busy work which can get boring quickly depending on who you are. 7/10Overall though Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a must own game which has great gameplay\, great story\, great graphics and a great world I would gladly loose a few months of my life to this game and I believe I will.Verdict: 9.4/10 a true masterpiece!… Expand",true

Some people think of MTs as cheat codes\, not necessary to the core experience\, pay or don't\, not a big deal. But when game developers purposefully pressure the player into using them to enrich their experience\, it puts the consumer at a disadvantage and hurts the industry. MGS V has a relatively deep base-building mechanic\, including recruiting soldiers who can be sent on off-screen missions to gather resources. This aspect of the game is throttled for those unwilling to pay real-world dollars (see details below). In a game that already loves to take it’s time with load screens\, cut scenes\, traversing great distances\, and crawling (a lot) this is unacceptable. Used in this way\, microtransactions are a threat to the best aspects of games: building skills\, overcoming challenges\, sharing common experiences\, etc. It's disgusting how much the industry has jumped on board with this mindset\, and even more so that players are letting them get away with it.The gameplay mechanics of MGS V are solid\, I've played all the main-entry MGS games and Phantom Pain maintains the high standard and ridiculously convoluted plot. But this time around you are building an army. This allows for the development of new departments\, new items\, and new mechanics which shape the way you play missions. An interesting if time-consuming idea\, but somewhat enjoyable. However\, once you get your base up and running\, an important part of resource-gathering is sending troops out on deployment missions while you simultaneously take on actual missions. Each is rated with risk\, reward and a timer. Riskier/longer = bigger payday. However\, you are limited to conducting two of these at a time\, regardless of manpower\, due to the lack of additional FOBs (command posts) which the game encourages you to build. However\, this feature is essentially hidden behind a paywall since you purchase FOBs with \""MP\"". MP is different from the currency used throughout the rest of the game\, and is doled out for free through game progression but only in tiny increments. Or it's purchased in bulk for real-world money. New FOBs cost 1000+ MP\, about $10\, so you can save for weeks (months) as the game provides you scraps\, or open your wallet. Those are your options.Just as bad\, the rewards from those deployment missions go up substantially as their duration climbs to multiple real-time days (all the big ones are \""online\"" so they progress whether you play or not)\, but you can speed up that process with the click of a button and\, you guessed it\, some MP. Waiting it out might be okay for someone who plays a few hours every weekend for months\, returning each time to a big reward\, but this was obviously designed as a cash grab. Who wants to wait 6 days for the resources you need now\, in a video game? (Unless the point is to teach the player patience. & I guess I wouldn’t put it past Kojima at this point (or buy anything from him)). Want that new rocket launcher? Tactical suit? All the fancy upgrades await! If you have the cash. They should just install a general store at Motherbase and be done with it.… Expand",true

No other game uses an open world environment  as a part of the gameplay asThis is easily the hardest review I have ever had to write. Let me start by saying that metal gear solid 5 is definitely an incredible game\, and is unlike any other game ever  made and probably unlike anything that will  ever be made. the gameplay  is undoubtedly the strongest and most incredible part of the game. No other game uses an open world environment  as a part of the gameplay as well as the phantom pain. exploring the beautiful open deserts of Afghanistan and the wet jungles and barren plains of Africa is fun but what makes the open world so great is how its terrain\, weather\, time of day and enemy bases placed in the world plays a huge role in how you decide to go about your missions and the enormous amount of resources and gadgets you have at your disposal gives an endless amount of gameplay styles and options while in the field.  the game leaves everything up to you and does not hold your hand at all\, allowing you create your own war stories unique to you. I genuinely feel that any one else who plays this game will have a completely different experience than I did when it came to how they went about completing their missions and that's pretty freaking awesome\, in fact this has alot to do with the games key themes that are reveled at the end of the game\, which I will not spoil for you. every mission is memorable and well directed and realized and are extremely enjoyable\, until you get into the post game\, which is my biggest issue of the game. unfortunately the director of the game hideo kojima did not get all the time he needed to finish the game how he intended\, and the game was rushed by the publishers of the game. This left the last ten or so missions being recycled missions from earlier in the game with the difficulty of the missions being ramped up. this is extremely disappointing because the meat of the story is in these final chapters of the game and the narrative doesn't flow at all because the missions don't translate into whats going on near the end and its such a shame that we couldn't play the missions kojima could have made if he was given the time. The story of the game is the most controversial topic it seems when it comes to the game\, which I wont spoil\, but I will say the main story until the post missions start is pretty straight forward and easy to follow. The cut scenes are beautifully directed and the voice acting is superb\, and the main story is actually quite compelling even though it doesn't have the amount of revelations and plot twists fans may have expected\, but the incredibly profound ideas and themes the franchise is known for is still all there in spades\, especially in the post game. The post game and ending are where people are really divided on this game\, and when I played through the ending of this game\, I was dumbfounded by the twist and to be honest quite angry\, but after a day or two thinking about it and trying to figure out what kojima was trying to do with this ending\, I ended up loving it and I feel that much like metal gear solid 2\, people are going to be really upset about it for a while\, but as the years go by and people think about it more\, people are going to appreciate what the ending was trying to do and I think people will start seeing how incredible of a game and a work of art this game is. I would love to give this game a 10 but because of the recycling of older missions by the end and how it breaks up the flow of the narrative\, I cant\, but I do believe this game is a masterpiece.… Expand",true

During the development of The Phantom Pain there was great conflicts between Kojima Productions\, the developer of the game\, and Konami\, the game publisher. This lead to aspects of the game never being fully finished. The game features some of the best graphics and gameplay I have ever seen but suffers from a poorly told unfinished story.MGSV has amazing graphics that really make it stand above the crowd. The game uses the FOX engine a brand new engine that was created in house by Kojima Productions. The engine is able to create some of the most photorealistic graphics to date. The character models are very detailed and look amazing during cutscenes and show a variety of facial expressions. The environments are also extremely detailed. Especially the map of Afghanistan which is full of detail from the sun soaked desert to the small but detailed military compounds that are spread throughout the map. On the other hand the map of Central Africa lacks that same detail. The areas are dull looking and have savanna grass lands that lack the detail of Afghanistan's desert. It would have been better if the game took place on one map so the graphics could be much more consistent. The game does feature a day and night cycle as well as dynamic weather effects that are quite beautiful. For an open world game made for current and last gen consoles MGSV is a graphical treat.MGSV sadly tells a poor story. Due to the fact Kojima and his team were rushed in development the story does not end on a complete note. The intro of the game is amazing and really hyped me up for the story the game would tell but it only ends in disappointment. MGS games are known for telling amazing stories that are complete and contain much social commentary. MGSV does contain social commentary such as revenge\, the effects of war on individuals\, child soldiers\, the Cold War\, bioterrism\, and the theme of language and how it affects our society but lacks a complete narrative arc to tell them completely. To avoid spoilers I will only give a very basic summary of the story. In MGSV you play as the legendary soldier Big Boss(aka Snake) who has been in a coma for 9 years after the destruction of his military base. The player must help Snake build his base back up and take revenge on the man who destroyed his base. Overall the story is basic and very common for a series that has created some of gaming’s best narratives. The game contains very little story due to the game’s episodic structure. Most of the story is hidden in cassette tapes the player can listen to. It would have been to see this conversions in cutscenes rather than these cassette tapes. The MGS series is known for using cinematic storytelling and uses lots of heavily detailed long cutscenes. Sadly MGSV contains very little of these but the few that are there are very well done. MGSV is story also ends with a bad plot twist that further weakens the experience.MGSV on the other hand has the best gameplay of the series. The game gives the player many ways to tackle each mission in the game. The player can sneak into the enemy base and play it stealthy or they can go guns blazing and murder everyone at the base. MGSV also has many cool gadgets and tools the player can use to tackle each mission. The first chapter has the best missions of the game while the second one is weak and forces the player to replay old missions on harder difficulties to unlock new ones. The guns in the game have a real punch to them and so does the close corridors combat. MGSV is an open world game and is spread out between the two maps of Afghanistan and Central Africa. The open world is barren and barely populated with people or things that interesting to do besides the missions. Kojima should have had the game be a linear experience like his previous games. The open world sadly adds nothing to the game and should have been scrapped. In between missions the player can stop at Mother Base where the player can customize. On the battlefield troops can be knocked out and ballooned to Mother Base to help you with missions. The occasional boss fights are a refreshing break from the sneaking missions but them uninspired. Overall MGSV offers the best gameplay of the series.MGSV is an amazing game despite the complaints I have mentioned. The gameplay and graphics are really something special but the story is saddly underwhelming. If Kojima opted for a more linear story based style the game would have been 10. MGSV is still an excellent game and is must buy for what it does right. Kojima Production is now working on a new game on a new game called “Death Stranding” which will be an open world action game. This worries me a bit but I hope that he is able to learn from the lessons of MGSV by giving Death Stranding a better plot and using his new Decima engine to create photorealistic graphics that improve upon the FOX engine.9/10: Excellent… Expand",true

84843,MGSVTPP,2015-11-03,10,"Metal Gear Solid V is the second Metal Gear Solid game I have ever played so I am no fanboy of this franchise but this game has turned me into one. I will review this game in a few parts :GRAPHICSGAMEPLAYSTORYLEVEL DESIGNONLINE.GRAPHICS:Let's start of with graphics now I played this game on the PS4 so the game runs at 1080p 60 FPS which means this is a incredibly smooth game and it is filled to the brim with detail and it is incredibly focused on making this game realistic like when I was looking through my goggles and it was a warm day in the game so in the distance there was a blur just like in real life. The physics are also great though sometimes do a few funny glitches but it's not annoying it's instead funny so in all the graphics score a 10/10GAMEPLAY:The gameplay in this game is incredibly varied on one side we have incredible deep and rich stealth mechanics and on the other side we have explosions and guns and havoc so let's look at the stealthy approach first before The Boss snaps my neck. Boss has at his disposal an array of ways of eliminating his enemies silently. There's the hilarious cardboard box which can be equipped with posters to ensue different reactions from the enemy. You can put a target to sleep kill him or punch him in the face you can also interrogate enemy's for useful bits of information. Now on the explosion side. Boss has so many lethal weapons it's hard to chose sniper rifles\, machine guns\, handguns freaking rocket launchers and all of these weapons can be customized to either be more quite or more loud and deadly you also have your companions like D-Walker who can be equipped with non-lethal or lethal weapons and so can the other companions like D-Dog and Quiet but not D-Horse because you can't exactly give a RPG to a horse and hope he kills a few guys but there's even more stuff to do than missions let's talk about the coolest of all the gameplay options and that is running Diamond Dogs. You see Boss has a private military force who will develop new weapons for him and he can send soldiers on missions for money in this case GMP and resources which you can use to upgrade Mother Base your main HQ this is feels instantly fresh and new and plus your staff get's cool and funny names like Flying Mantis or something. There are also side ops which can be done at your leisure but you want to do them because you can find rare soldiers and resources during the side ops so they are Worth it and they are also story side ops that will advance the story but only when you want it so the gameplay is rich and is Worth a 10/10STORY: Let's talk about the story now for people who haven't played the previous metal gear solid games you will have trouble following some of the characters tales but after a few videos about some of the characters I loved the characters way more and they became way more important to me but that was at the beginning but at the end and after the actions they perform they would have stilled have been important to me without the lore videos. The game starts in a mental hospital in Cyprus where Big Boss but I call him Boss like the other characters wakes up after a 9 year coma with his left arm missing he then is attacked by the PF Cipher but with the help of a mysterious stranger he escapes the hospital and is brought to Afghanistan with Revolver Ocelot where the Boss must save his old friend Kaz Miller. This game touches on some adult themes like the physiological impact of losing limbs\, it also talks about child soldiers and also has a central theme concerning languages and nuclear weapons but let's talk controversy which concerns the character Quiet she is almost naked but in my opinion this is explained as she was burned and the language parasites saved her life but she breathes through her skin which  means she doesn't like wearing clothes because it makes it difficult for her to breath and after in the story her ending is bitter sweet and it actually made me cry which proves she is well developed and she inspired emotions in me even if she can't talk her actions make her who she is. The campaign lacks lengthy cuteness but the few cutscenes they are well made and are great to watch. So the campaign scores a 9/10LEVEL DESIGN: The level design in this game allows for both action and stealth gameplay without punishing the other the first half of the game has a variety of scenarios which allow for a great variety of approaches but the second half of the story missions feel repetitive from the last ones so the level design scores a 9/10ONLINE: The online part of this game was delayed a while but it has been finally released and it is pretty fun the mode allows you to use your custom avatar you created at the beginning of the game and allows you to change him with armor hats and loadouts they are some balancing issues like my level 10 butt getting destroyed by level 38 players and a connection issue with the first mode but the other modes are fun so 8/1… Expand",true

84856,MGSVTPP,2016-11-02,9,"Story - Story-wise\, the game's plot is the weakest of the Main series of Metal Gear (MGS 1-4). The advancement of the story is weak and so many non important details has been focused on. The main story continued from GZ\, \""Big Boss\"" is alive and together with Ocelot and Miller will start to build the new group Diamond Dogs to defeat and get revenge against XOF and its leader Skull Face. It really is a good setting for a plot but my issue are its lack of relevant or good cutscenes which really shows the sense in its story. and the endings doesnt really show any closure.In addition\, It also has a weak cast of characters overall\, the main antagonist Skull face is cool but his inspirations and reasons to play his part is weak and unreasonable. Quiet's character is another dissapointment\, Kojima obviously wants her to be that tragic heroine but that never occurred to me since we have so little cutscenes to know and understand the character. The \""Big Boss\"" of this game is TOO Quiet too. Miller's voice is irritating and annoying. Eli is meh. While Ocelot\, Code Talker and D-Dog are the only good characters in-game. Hell\, I even liked Huey than most of the character in game. Ill give this part a 7/10.Campaign - This game is divided between two main chapters. The first one is its strength\, It consists of 31 missions that are all unique\, fun and challenging in their own way. While the second one really takes the overall fun in the game. It has 19 missions overall of which 12 are only reused missions with a twist\, the other 7 are the only unique ones of which are all good and fun. But really\, you cant enjoy a game with repeating mission all over again. A score of 8/10.Gameplay - Now this is the real gem of the game. Its gameplay is one of the most creative ever made. It has A LOT of gameplay of which you will not see in other games. Its recommended to do stealth for you to obtain high rank but the game really gives you freedom of how you play through your missions\, you could go all bazooka if you want\, or you could just snipe everyone from a distance\, you could call in your base to start bombardment on a place on your choice or you could go the classic MGS style stealth of doing your missions without anyone knowing you are there. Damn\, The gameplay of this entry is the best in MGS universe. A deserving score of 10/10Graphics - It is a Kojima productions game. So of course its graphics will be top notched. the environments of both afrika and afghanistan are detailed and spot on\, I love the different weather conditions you can encounter like the sandstorms in afghanistan\, rains and thunders in afrika and the fog in the Mother base. It is really smooth and rarely i see any framerate drops in game even during combat time. No issues for me in this part so a 10/10 will be enough.Music - ITS GREAT. It has its own original soundtrack and thos classic ones. yeah\, i love listening to them all while im just sitting in the support chopper waiting for my development periods. 10/10Total Average = 9.0I could really see how Kojima wanted Phantom Pain the best and final entry of the series and give us fans the most epic MGS game of all time. However\, due also to the staggering amount of money he uses to complete the game\, Konami had no choice but to pull the trigger and decide to make Kojima stop to cause more expenses to the game of which resulted to the incomplete and dissapointing campaign and story of the game (Mission 51). For me\, i cant pick sides since both has their point\, one side wants to make the best game he can ever do while the other just cant give more if it would hurt their business. But as a fan of the series\, i am really dissapointed of Konami and Kojima separation since we wont now know the missing link of the big boss arc and the solid snake arc. However\, I can say that MGS is one of the most and best series ever released in the gaming industry. I salute both Kojima and Konami for the love and support they gave to this franchise and for its fans. I hope Konami would take care of MGS now without Kojima.… Expand",true

The players has a lot of room to decide what strategy to employ for a given mission. Furthermore\, the environnements (war torn Afghanistan and Angola) are engaging. You will probably be compelled to keep playing MGS5.However\, in doing so\, you might find yourself increasingly annoyed at the weakness of the story. It is puzzling and immature -- a trait that only tends to worsen as the game goes on. You'd wish Hideo Kojima would have exploited his evidently good knowledge of war and conflict to anchor the plot in something a bit more real. God knows it can be gruesome but it would have given his game depth.Instead\, he chose to relegate MGS5's gorgeous setting to no more than a kind of wallpaper to this series self-indulging and sometimes exasperating internal mythology. There is a startling contrast between the maturity of the setting and the immaturity of the narrative. Naturally\, it is difficult to discuss this without giving away too much. But players (especially older ones)\, may be disappointed with the numerous cheap plot twists and thin characters. The ending feels especially half-arsed.

84875,MGSVTPP,2015-09-03,10,"MGSV is\, hands down\, the best of the franchise gameplay wise\, and a contender for best game all around as well.TPP takes a departure from previous titles (bar Peace Walker) in the sense that is no longer a linear\, cutscene-plagued game.

Cutscenes are less prominent than in previous games (except for the prologue\, but it's expected for the introduction to ANY game to have plenty of cutscenes anyway)\, and missions are split. This means\, no longer games where a single score was given to the whole playthrough. Each mission has it's individual score\, and they can be redone if you're not sastified with the result\, albeit with a reward reduction (half the GMP [money] reward).Main missions have the mandatory objectives to fulfill\, and then hidden ones which are optional to complete but add up (either by score\, or with personeel/gear). The game grants you total freedom on how to complete them. If the mission says \""Eliminate x target\""\, you can fulton him and it'll be fine (as a matter of fact\, fultoning is preferrable to killing\, as the targets are\, more often than not\, proficient at their job).Then you have side ops. These are missions which don't need to be completed to advance through the storyline\, but whose rewards are so great that\, in some cases\, it's basically impossible to progress without doing them. Also\, there are some side ops (tagged in yellow) which are still a must do anyway. Side ops are\, imo\, way more enjoyable than the main missions\, since you have no scoring whatsoever for them\, and you can do them the way you want without being punished.In terms of freedom\, MGSV is a game which\, albeit rewarding stealth over action\, still allows you go guns blazing and get an S score anyway (happened to me so many times). You can also just explore the vast Afghan world (not to spoil anything\, there's more to explore than just Afghanistan)\, and take on outposts and main bases for new recruits\, diamonds (GMP source)\, vehicles\, and resources to build up your motherbase. Random events (sandstorms\, rains\, etc) will make it easier to infiltrate\, but also harder to spot the enemy if you haven't done that beforehand (you can scout enemy positions with your binocs).This game has more two unique features\, when compared to previous titles; Motherbase\, and buddies. While Motherbase isn't precisely a new one (already present in Peace Walker)\, here it's been reworked extensively. GMP is no longer obtained from recruits\, but from sending them to Outer Ops\, finding diamons\, and doing Side Ops and Main Missions. It won't expand on it's own either; you need to order the construction of new facilities for it to expand\, and such demands time\, GMP\, and resources. Unlike PW\, you can also visit your MP\, which is actually required because if you're away for too long\, your soldiers will miss you and eventually fight amongst each other. While not mandatory to go back\, some game events force you do it. You'll want to go anyway for allowing certain things to happen (there's a Main Mission which requires you to go back actually).Then\, you have the buddy system. Basically\, it's a companion which you can bring with you to combat. Only one is avaliable from start\, with others being obtainable from certain events (if you don't do them\, then you won't get them). They play a big role in helping you\, so it's advisable to recruit all of them if possible.For story telling\, the game largely reduced the cutscenes and replaced the info delivery with cassette tapes (also getting rid of the CODEC this way). I find this to be a god sent as you can listen to the tapes when exploring the world or just wandering around your base\, meaning that no time is lost.All things considered (with my 30 hours worth of playing so far)\, this is my final score and pros-cons:Pros:Excellent Gameplay.Great Story (and it's delivery system. Not an overburden of cutscenes).Unparalleled customization capability for a MGS game.Open world\, non-linear experience\, with results in basically being different for each player.Mother base building (I love management\, can be a con. Not too bothersome\, just a two-minute browsing every now and then. You can do it while riding your chopper).Cons:Staff morale mechanics (you have to go and see EVERY SINGLE SOLDIER to raise their morale. When your base gets big\, there's no point in doing it. The penalty isn't that bad either way).Shower isn't really needed to clean the blood. Just change your outfit and you're set. If the blood and it's cons were intended as a way to make you go back to MB\, then it failed miserably.PS: Ignore the guy who gave a zero. He only did the prologue and failed miserably. **** gets great (if it didn't already) in mission 1.… Expand",true

This game is more along the lines of those two\, offering much more freedom than the standard MSG formula of moving through a room and watching a 30 minute cutscene followedI'll have to say that this game does feel like more of a Metal Gear Spinoff that a true Metal Gear game. However\, that's great for me\, because my 2 favorite in the series were Peacewalker (the remake for ps3) and MGS3. This game is more along the lines of those two\, offering much more freedom than the standard MSG formula of moving through a room and watching a 30 minute cutscene followed by a 15 minute codec conversation. Don't get me wrong\, all MGS games have been stellar\, but I found MGS4 and 2 to be the worst as it offered the most limited gameplay and terribly long cutscenes.That being said\, for 60$ or less depending on when you get it\, the bang for your buck is astounding. Go on missions\, free roam\, or do side ops while building up your base\, with an option to further things with the online portion which is also pretty robust. The story is fleshed out with long casette tape recordings so if you want in on it\, play the tapes. Or don't\, it's up to you. I love the freedom. After completing about a 2 hour session of missions and free roaming (extracting specialists for my base and scrouging for precious supplies) I sat and listened to  a few tapes on the way back to Mother Base to fill in the story a bit. Everything you do in the field has an impact on your base and while the world is a little sparse\, it's really all about infiltrating outposts and finding stuff to extract and build your resources. The amount of weapon variations and gadgets is huge and once you start cruising with R&D you won't even know what to do with all the possibilities at hand. Also\, having buddies come with you on missions to build trust is also essential and really enhances the gameplay. Any hey\, if you don't feel like stealthing it and just want to blow **** up\, you can do that too. The controls are as tight as any game I've played on new gen thus far\, so you can shoot it out with high caliber weapons if you so desire. Or go ahead and call in that support chopper to rain hell as you sit back and enjoy the view from a hilltop with your horse.Gameplay is emergent and things happen that you would not expect. You can do things that seem logical and they work\, like shining a flash light at a guard with night vision which will blind them. Leave an unconscious guard on a bed and no one will notice\, or they stop and complain that they are lazy\, lol. I recently had an incident where I deeply infiltrated a base to extract a specialist\, but as I pick him up to carry him out I was spotted. I booked up a cliff under heavy fire I noticed he got clipped a couple of times by his buddies. I thought nothing of it\, except that when I tried to extract him out he was dead\, lol. That sucks but at least it makes sense. Stuff like this that you don't expect frequently happens during gameplay. For instance\, guards can clearly see you from a long distance during the day\, but they have rely on spotlights and flashlights at night\, so doing missions in the dark is logically much easier. Other times they will shoot flares out in an effort to spot you. Simply put\, things feel natural and if you think you can do it\, you probably can actually. If you put on green camo\, you hide better in tall green grass. Put on the yellow camo and you hide better in the desert. It makes sense and the game doesn't need to explain it to you.The one thing that detracts from all this though is the addition of boundaries at certain places. You can climb a cliff as long there is a crack\, but sometimes you can't traverse up a 5 foot high stone for instance. It's kind of distracting when it happens. Another thing\, for some reason soldiers sometimes act really dumb and I'm wondering if they don't all have there own hidden skill levels. Every once in a while you will see them make some stupid decisions. Also\, sneaking around in a box has always been ludicrous\, but it's a staple of series at this point but I choose not to use it too much. I guess no game is perfect\, but overall gameplay wise this might be the deepest game I've come across yet.Tell ya what\, if you liked Peacewalker just get the game and you won't regret. The lack of major cutscenes in the game is a little jarring if your a fan of MGS4\, but otherwise the game is superb. It's not like there are no cutscenes\, it's just that they are not as developed and snake barely says anything in them.My one ohter disappointment is that there a clear lack of boss battles like some of the legendary ones in games past. Those were the highlights of previous games but they are almost non-existent here or are completely underwhelming. You won't any find battles like the one against Psycho mantis or The end\,etc. So I have to knock the game down a notch to 9 because of that\, but hey it's already got plenty of straight 10s… Expand",true

Each mission starts you several hundred feet away from your objective (albeit with an annoyingly long\, unskippable cutscene) letting you choose how you get to the objective\, and from what angle you take it on. It's a very dynamic\, reactionary game that lets you tackle things the way you want to tackle them. I'm not saying that choice is necessary in all games (linear games have their place)\, but it certainly works in this game. And that's the main difference between this game and Splinter Cell. Choice.This is my first MGSV. I hadn't played Ground Zeroes\, so I was completely new to the franchise's convoluted (from what I've heard) story. The story in this game is very bare bones. Big Boss speaks incredibly rarely\, and I had very little context to any of it. Psychomantis? FIre Guy? Skull Face? Sahelanthropus? The hell is all this? Unlike Witcher 3\, this game's story is unfriendly to newcomers. But does it matter? Not really. I have a few other complaints such as a lack of variety in a few levels\, challenge levels that serve to pad the game's length\, etc\, etc. But its a fun game. And that's really what matters the most.… Expand",true

I could easily complete the first 15 missions in only two attempts\, but from then I had to at least try 4 times before I could complete the whole mission.",true
84917,MGSVTPP,2016-05-22,8,"I am a big MGS fan\, but I have mixed feelings about The Phantom Pain. It's a highly ambitious game that sadly doesn't hit its goals\, maybe because of the notorious fallout between Konami and Kojima.The story\, one of the trademarks of the MGS series\, is both the worst and most under-developed ever (even MGS 4 had a much better and more impactful one). After a good start in the Hospital escape and the Miller rescue\, the storytelling becomes either irrelevant or bland\, only to pick up in the final few missions (which end up with Skull Face's death and the destruction of Metal Gear). The almost silent Big Boss (who is too calm for a man supposedly hell bent on revenge) voiced by Kiefer Sutherland doesn't help matters\, and most other major characters are disappointing (Ocelot and Skull Face in particular) and at times make no sense. Only Huey was a well written\, complex and tragic character\, and Miller to a lesser degree. Quiet is a mysterious and interesting figure who simply walks away in the end. The pre-release trailers set up a magnificent premise\, but the story is\, to put it frankly\, totally different to what we would expect from Kojima.Another big issue is that the game is incomplete. There is the notorious Episode 51 which was cut from the game and is available on Youtube to watch\, but I suspect there is more content which was cut. I don't understand why they cut this particular episode as it is awesome\, and it ties Eli's (he's young Liquid Snake\, but most people recognised him in the trailers anyway) loose end who in the game simply disappeared from Mother Base\, his fate left unexplained.The story may be a disappointment\, but gameplay is simply fantastic. Missions are designed in such a way that you can infiltrate enemy posts from whatever path you want\, whichever method you see fit\, and whatever time of day you wish. You have to choose from either stealth\, Rambo-style-all-guns-blazing\, or a mixture\, and use whatever gadgets you have. Obviously the way to go is stealth\, preferably at night\, because the AI is competent enough to be a serious threat. If alerted\, the enemy soldiers surround the player\, and if you hide while being hunted they won't forget you easily as they keep searching for quite a time. Individual AIs aren't the smartest\, but it's a game\, not a military simulator. One of the best features is the inclusion of AI companions to aid you in the field (it's 100% optional\, but I highly recommend using all the help you can get). You start with D-Horse\, then add D-Dog (smells enemies from afar automatically and attacks them if ordered)\, Quiet (tracks enemies automatically and shoots/tranquilizes them if ordered)\, and D-Walker (a walking robot\, which is both a transport vehicle and can track and shoot enemies automatically). You can ride a jeep or a tank\, too\, in order to travel between locations. There are 2 maps\, Afghanistan and Africa\, and both are huge in size and varied\, even featuring animals and plants.Another big part of gameplay is Mother Base and the Fulton extraction balloon. You can extract enemy soldiers or prisoners of war via Fulton\, and convince them to join your ranks so as to raise your army\, or extract material containers in order to expand your Mother Base. The more and better troops you have\, the more perks you get from Mother Base (mortar strikes\, weather predictions\, enemy reports\, etc.) and you can unlock new weapons and gadgets to use on the field.The game has 2 online modes\, FOB Missions and Metal Gear Online. The former is tied to the single player campaign\, as you infiltrate (PvE style) the FOBs of other players and steal material containers or soldiers\, and can be quite challenging when invading an FOB with fully armed troops and anti-theft devices. The latter is a standard PvP online game suite. Nothing outstanding (maybe except the newly added Survival mode)\, but not bad either.A few words about the graphics and sound. The game is powered by the Fox Engine. While the game's graphics aren't cutting edge (you can easily see polygon details everywhere)\, it's beautiful\, with one of the best lighting models out there. And it runs at stable 60 fps\, not bad for an open world game on consoles. The only downside is the small draw distance for foliage\, shadows and textures\, but it's handled carefully (they fade in/out\, instead of abruptly popping in). As for the sound\, the effects are great\, but the soundtrack isn't memorable. The \""Sins of the Father\"" song is awesome\, though.Overall\, it's a great game\, non-MGS fans won't lose themselves to 60 minute cut-scens\, but the diehards will feel disappointed. Anyway\, buy the game and enjoy it as I did.MEGA SPOILER: The final and true ending\, which links the entire saga in a not-so-perfect way\, is the best thank you I have ever seen in a video game. At the same time\, Kojima pulled another MGS 2 stunt on us. Even bigger than the previous one. That's all I will say about it.… Expand",true

CQC can be frustrating\, especially trying to make it so not alert happens. sometimes i see a group of 3 guys\, i walk up to them and try to do the chain-knock out and i may accidentally grab one\, and then one gets alerted\, and i get shot\, or ill punch them once instead of throw them. the difference is very subtle related to the controller\, between tapping\, holding and pressing the joystick at an angle. also it doesn't seem you can cqc chain out of a cardboard box\, and not get alerted which kind of sucks. and also\, i notice when i grab a guy to use as a human shield while there is another enemy next to him\, the slow down phase for some reason goes away and the guy starts shooting me alerting the base. it seems like i should be able to go up\, grab a guy\, use him as a shield and take the other guy out without getting shot at or alerted. it's just frustrating sometimes.5. you don't get to use the weapons very much. since you mostly want to stealth mission\, for most the game you won't be using all the weapons. and even if you get caught\, you don't really have time grenade laucnhing or shotgunning fools left and right. this isn't to say you CAN'T\, but there's no real incentive to it. the series has always been like this\, but this game definitely fixes it with its sandbox style\, and missions where you have to blow things up or shoot people. ALSO\, because you want soldiers back at your base\, there is another incentive to not kill anyone. and because killing brings down your \""heroism\"" and reduces your score (which i'm still not sure what that does). so basically\, there's all sorts of incentive not to kill and just go around tranquilzing people in the head. it's an MGS game\, i know.6. horse controls sort of suck. extremely frustrating getting stuck on the side of mountain while being chased by those weird gas mask freaks.7. i think i've said this before\, but sometimes i just feel like im cheating when it comes to sneaking. that isn't to say the game isn't hard because it is. but a lot of times i just end up crawling around the perimeter of the base.  this is only sometimes though because of certain base layouts8. lots of content that isn't really content. there's all sorts of things to get\, and missions to get and do which you can't play (you just assign people)\, and there's all sorts of rating systems which i don't even understand. i'm not really complaining\, and the ratings are sort of unsatisfying. like heroism for example\, i don't know where the top is. it seems to fill up a circle and then start over again. is 20\,000 heroism good? i dunno?9. i sort of don't want to say this but it is sort of repetitive. but so is every game if you think about it. especially games that get rated 1010. could use more life to the game. i love the dialogue at mother base\, but there's only like 3 lines that i've heard.

The story is perfect while a lot of people may complain about it and how doesn't do anything for the saga it actually finishes the saga. The big downside to that is you can't actually understand or appreciate it unless you play all of the other metal gear games. I was pretty dumbfounded at first and frustrated that I couldn't get it but then I replayed a main mission and paid attention to the details and it hit me. Tons of easter eggs and hidden stuff that makes it worth replaying. If you are a fan or have been interested pick up a copy but be sure play the other games or read a wiki to jog your memory of the universe of metal gear. One quick tip just to help you out\, the title means more than it seems.… Expand",true

84958,MGSVTPP,2015-09-24,9,"Easily my most anticipated game in years and I'd say the wait was worth it. Mostly. For the most part this is an extremely polished\, engaging\, high quality adventure and pretty much perfect. There are some undeniable problems\, though\, most of which have to do with the story. I'll section this review into pieces.Gameplay: Let's start with the part that makes the game shine above everything. Gameplay in MGS V is absolutely amazing and easily makes it the best Metal Gear game to date. It's been a very long time since a game has captivated me this much with its gameplay. There's a lot to do\, so many options of how to do those things and a whole bunch of replay value. There is a huge selection of weapons\, gadgets\, bionic arms and other tech that you can develop and use. Along with that you've also got tons of missions that can also be replayed many times to try out different routes\, methods\, weapons\, to collect everything you missed the first time around or to finish the objectives that you've yet to do. The gameplay in the field\, of course\, is absolutely fantastic. As I said\, there's an insane amount of options on how you can do things and the way Snake moves and controls is completely perfect. 10/10 for Gameplay.Graphics: Not gonna go too deep into this. The game is beautiful and looks exactly as good as in the trailers. Beautiful lighting and no framerate issues\, nor any bugs that I noticed. 10/10 for Graphics.Story: Now\, here's the part that's problematic. Metal Gear games have always been filled with story and this one is no exception. There's a ton of story\, background information and more. Interesting is\, is that the story is told through tapes rather than anything else. It's a good method to add more to the story\, but it also somehow takes away a little from the story\, because it makes you feel like some of the tapes should've been cutscenes. Anyway\, that's not the actual problem with the story. The two biggest problems are that the story ends too abruptly. Mission 51 is missing\, which means that Chapter 2 never truly ends\, unless you watch the mission online or on the Collector's Edition Blu Ray. Not excusable\, though. The bigger issue\, though\, is the fact that it really feels like Chapter 3 is completely missing. And that's not just coming from rumours. When you finish the game you just feel like there's something missing. Another Chapter\, another location\, another Support Buddy\, name it\, it all feels like it's missing. Just think of the storylines that weren't continued\, like Kaz's apparent blindness\, Big Boss' actual descent into a demon and so on. On top of that comes the fact that some of the cutscenes that were in the trailers didn't make it into the game. I don't know who's fault this is\, whether it's Kojima or Konami\, but it just feels like a third of the game is missing. No amount of audio-cassettes is going to make up for that omission. Chapter 1 was very focused and well done and all the cutscenes are beautiful and excellently directed\, but Chapter 2 is quite unfocused\, but not without its moments and the fact that there's an entire chapter missing is just a tragedy. On the one hand I hope we get it as DLC\, but on the other hand I'm not so sure. Anyway\, I'll give the story an 8/10.Altogether the game is still fantastic and nearly perfect\, but the fact that a huge chunk is missing just sours it a little bit for me. 9/10.… Expand",true

I always reference it to no end. Metal gear solid 4\, 3\, and 1 are some of my favorite games of all time\, 4 actually being my #1. But then\, i thought 4 was the end of the saga. But then Peace Walker happened\, then Rising\, and one thing led to another and now we have Metal gear solid 5: the phantom pain.The story opens with one of the greatest openings to a video game of all time\, in my opinion. 9 years after the attack on mother base in 1975\, Snake wakes up in a hospital\, missing an arm\, and has a large piece of shrapnel stuck in his head. Cipher (zero's organization) has just now tracked him down and invades the hospital\, intending to kill Snake. With the help of a mysterious figure\, Ishmael\, Snake escapes from the hospital\, after encounters with XOF soldiers\, a floating child\, a man on fire\, and a flaming whale. (?) This entire sequence is so fun\, and i will never forget my first time playing through it. Once we get out of the hospital\, we rendezvous with Ocelot (Yes\, THE ocelot)\, and save Miller from Russian soldiers in Afghanistan. After rescuing Miller\, we learn he and Ocelot have created a replacement organization for MSF\, Diamond Dogs.Now\, i'm going to be frank\, I didn't like the story of Phantom Pain. It all goes downhill after the first few missions. There is so many filler missions that have little to do with the plot\, except a cutscene afterwards tying what you just did to Skullface's plans\, just to make you feel what you just played was important to the plot. It lacks the true substance that made Metal gear what it is. Also\, a lack of boss fights. I was really disappointed by this. But there are a handful of memorable missions\, and the ending of the game was superbly handled\, and surprised me more than Metal gear solid 2.The gameplay is the highlight of Phantom Pain\, and is 90% of the reason i'm giving this game the score i am. You can approach a mission any way you choose\, picking your guns\, equipment\, items\, what buddy you take along\, what vehicle you bring\, what character you play as\, what you are wearing\, the options are endless. This makes the game endlessly replayable. There are some things that make this game feel more AAA\, such as the regenerative health and open world. But the open world i don't mind\, because this allows you to scout out and\, literally\, approach the objective as you please.The game also borrows a lot from Peace Walker. Like PW\, one of the main features is building and managing your Diamond Dogs force\, extracting soldiers\, vehicles\, animals and gun emplacements from the field. But unlike Peace Walker\, you can actually visit and walk around Mother Base\, checking in with your soldiers\, and even the animals at your personal zoo. You can also develop new weapons and gadgets\, upgrading them\, along with making equipment for your buddies and helicopter. This\, i really enjoyed\, although I didn't really see a point in visiting mother base\, aside in raising soldier moral and keeping fights from breaking out. Also\, the FOB system is trash\, i don't even go near that.(on a final note\, at the time of the review\, MGO has not launched yet\, so i will not be talking about that.) Overall\, Phantom Pain felt like a bigger version of peace walker\, featuring better gameplay\, but sacrificing some of the story. 9/10… Expand",true

The world of MGS5 is vast but empty so you probably won't be exploring it much as you will be using your chopper to go from one point to the other to start a mission.Unlike other MGS\, you have a mission list this time around and side ops (side quest) to choose and progress. Mission wise\, there are a lot of variation on how you wish accomplish the objective. You can be super stealth or you can just go in Rambo.I think the biggest let down of the whole game is the story. MGS being famous for its story sure didn't have much lines for Big Boss. It is no deal breaker but wish it could have been better at character development.There are 2 online features which was just launched. One being Online FOB mission where you can attack other players motherbase and loot their resources but I find there is no point doing this as it doesn't contribute anything to the main game apart from getting GMP(in game currency) and resources. Two being Metal Gear Online which honestly haven't been fun.Overall good fun\, worth checking out but don't complain about the story.… Expand",true

Then the game has an ending\, and another Chapter (2)\, which in order to unlock the final mission has all these prerequisites that you are going to have no idea for the most part what they are... come on?  Not to mention all the pointless mundane missions you have already completed thrown in there. Overall this was a huge and frustrating\, sometimes boring\, disappointment for me.… Expand",true

85043,MGSVTPP,2015-11-06,10,"MGS5 is - next to The Witcher 3 and Bloodborne - a game that impressed me the most since PS4 (and One) released\, and I can say without any doubt\, that it is one of the most polished\, rewarding and overall tense games that Ive played in years.First things first though: Im a Fan of the series\, played every major one (with MGS1 on PS1 as my favourite\, followed with 4 on PS3) and was veryMGS5 is - next to The Witcher 3 and Bloodborne - a game that impressed me the most since PS4 (and One) released\, and I can say without any doubt\, that it is one of the most polished\, rewarding and overall tense games that Ive played in years.First things first though: Im a Fan of the series\, played every major one (with MGS1 on PS1 as my favourite\, followed with 4 on PS3) and was very lookin forward to this game\, the more so after the phenomenal (imo) GroundZeroes which left me hungry for more and made me wanting that game even more.After all Ive read on the internet\, both press and user reviews\, Ive decided to just play it for myself and see if all the fuss is true. Heres what I think:I can understand people that say that the story is a bit lacking/not overall present\, as the predecessors were mostly playable movies/cutscenes with some short gameplay interruption in between. MGS5 is different \, there is \""story\"" there\, and there are quite a few long and brilliant cutscenes (as stylish as one would expect)\, but this time the game is NOT story driven\, its the GAMEPLAY that actually pushes you further. This is a major change\, and I can understand that many many people are angry because of that and consider it a huge disappointment. BUT I personally am very welcoming to this change of pace\, the story that is present\, and presented here (in cutscenes\, briefings and tapes to listen to)\, is extremely well written and - thankfully - not omnipresent any more. Its the actual gameplay that lets me be part of this story\, and I feel like being Snake for the very first time in the series.I also can understand how people bash about the \""samey\"" mission structure and how \""grindy\"" MGS5 can get - most missions are simply kill/rescue/extract missions. But\, honestly\, so what? Its an espionage game\, thats what espionage is all about - observation\, infiltration. And: The way you can do that is totally up to you\, the player.To be precise\, the game starts extremely great\, but leaves you almost \""naked\"" when you actually start to go on missions for yourself\, thats where the \""RPG\""-part comes in and shines - you have to play and unlock gear and weapons and gather info and material. That means that the longer you play\, the more and better equiment will be available for you\, offerring not only a change of pace and gameplay\, but also changes how you actually grow and play as the number one secret agent. For example\, some time in the game you will unlock a sniper riffle with non-deadly ammo\, c4\, a night scope\, and so on and so on - by unlockin those things\, missions become more tense and varied\, it feels extremely rewarding to not only upgrade your equipment\, but to get more and more options the more and longer you play.Same goes for your allies/buddies - you start with a horse that helps you get through the open world quick\, but sooner or later you will find way more useful allies\, such as DDog who stays at your side\, uncovering enemies and distracts or even kills them\, the extremely usefull sniper sidekick Quiet (no word needed for her design LOL)\, or even a small MetalGear that comes in handy if you\, well\, just want to blow everything up actually ^^Those sidekicks are extremely well implemented\, and I honestly cant think about how MGS was ever playable without them. They also \""level up\"" and can be upgraded so that they have more use in future missions.One thing that was really negative at first sight was the \""open world\""\, because I dont like those games in general\, I personally think open world games are exhausting and overly large just for the sake of game time\, which bores me to death.In MGS5 the open world is more regarding to the huge scope the mission areas are set in. The world itself surely is a bit \""empty\""\, were talking about Afghanistan desert and Afrika\, so dont expect much population or so. But\, the world itself is designed with infiltration in mind\, so the environment fits perfect for the missions and offer lots of spots to spy and tackle objectives from different angles.As someone that doesnt like open world games\, I must admit that this one is very well made for the concept of the infiltration/espionage part of MetalGear.Another huge part of the game is the mother base\, where you can employ stuff and let them tackle side missions or develop gear and equipment for you. Its highly complex and extremely addicting and rewarding\, I also like the fact that it feels important and as an integral part of the game\, not something you just \""can\"" do or thats annoying\, its meaningful and important all of the gametime.The multiplayer part\, Metal Gear Online\, surely is no time sinker for me\, because I just dont like online games in general\, I must admit its very well done - and how they implemented the stealthy gameplay into the action is really an achievement.From a technical standpoint\, the game is nothing less than impressive\, graphics and sound are breathtaking.I can fullheartedly recommend it\, its a masterpiece… Expand",true

85051,MGSVTPP,2015-11-24,9,"I'll say that I liked Guns of the Patriots (my personal favourite of the series) more than The Phantom Pain\, but it's still a really good game. Graphics are great and the passage of time is a nice addition of gameplay dynamic. I’ve been playing this game consistently since it came out. Which says a lot as I’m finally getting around to writing a review this long after release and still not tired of it.Cons:1.	The side quests are incredibly repetitive and you tire of doing the same thing over and over again.2.	Start of the story is a little slow and annoying at first\, though that is over with soon enough.3.	Some things cost way too much to upgrade.4.	Sending crew out on missions\, you will always have a percentage of failure\, no matter what level of troops you send. Example would be sending a crew of A+ against E’s\, you could still lose guys or have them injured. I guess that add a level of realism\, but I personally get irritated to lose high level soldiers against low level grunts5.	Actually\, I don’t have many things to say in the Cons section. It’s really a solid game.Pros:1.	Story picks up quickly and Hideo Kojima doesn’t disappoint you\, just like the others installations. You get a dose of nostalgia as you see the beginning of so many stories we had windows to from the previous games\, which is a nice treat.2.	As an open world game\, you have the absolute freedom to do what you want and when you want to.3.	There is a decent amount of challenge presented to the user in the Main Quests4.	The online aspect is a nice addition (if you opt-in)\, as you need to ensure you are defended from other users. Not to mention if you need to go “recruiting” from their camps. ;)5.	The addition of “Buddies” is an interesting choice. Each has their merit and you will find the one that suits your game style best. Though I’ll put money on you using DD more. ;)6.	Rocket arm?!?! Corny as $#!#\, but it’s sure handy. (Pun not intended)Completists will have loads of time to purchase all items and upgrade them. Not to mention the loads of side missions. Casual players will still be required to do a lot of both to progress otherwise you will start to get your ass handed to you later on.Personally\, in the previous instalments\, I’ll admit I always leaned to just dropping everyone with a headshot and leave ‘em for the buzzards. This game actually has me assessing each soldier to see if I should stun or kill.!!!SPOILER ALERT (kinda)!!! - There are users that will simply capture every soldier you come across. This can lead you to a fair bit of irritation later on\, as there is some management required. Trust me when I say\, be smart about your choices. ;)… Expand",true

As a fan of metal gear solid games\, this game was the weakest in terms of storyline and plot. The episodic type are new and fresh but the pacing of the story is really slow and predictable. It is just a quest for revenge with liitle to none good twist. It doesnt also help that the chapter 2 of the game just felt rushed and that unsatisfying but ok ending. As to the characters though\, It is not impressive overall. Ocelot\, D-Dog and Skull Face are the only characters who i found good in game. Miller is annoying as well as Eli\, Quiet has few interaction with Boss that i dont feel any care for her whatsoever\, guys like huey and code talker arent that good supporting cast also. The main character Venom Snake was somewhat quiet too but i dont mind that but due to that also\, i dont see anything likable at all to him since he is just like an almost silent protagonist using the body of Big boss. Overall\, i was dissapointed in what should be the main strength of MGS games. As such\, a score of 6/10 of suck bad performance deserves this for not living up to expectations.Gameplay - This aspect of the game is what really put MGSV to the top. Its campaign is long and the use of open world design is very good since it gives you the option of doing things the way you want like doing it with perfect stealth\, or go with guns blazing or calling motherbase to bombard everything\, hell you can even get in a heavily armored vehicle or tank to put destruction against your enemies. It also adds to the fun the different and unique you have on your arsenal to do your missions. The Ai of the enemies of this game in addition are also advanced and great. They will adjust in your playstyle and will try to flank you\, corner you or use strategies against you when you are fighting them. However\, there are also flaws as to its gameplay\, which really factors to its boss fights and that unremarkable chapter 2 of the game. As to the boss\, majority are only skulls\, super human always in 4 which is most of the boss fights in game. It is repetitive and dissapointing since MGS is one of those game which has one of the most memorable boss fights. With regard to chapter 2\, i hated those recycled missions in their hard mode which first not only gave you uneccesary annoyance\, but also didnt put more advancements in the storyline. They should have never considered going that path. However\, despite the notable weaknesses of its gameplay\, i can say that its strength's also is the best i have ever seen. Therefore\, a great score of 9/10 still deserves this part of the game.Graphics - This game really showed how advance that fox engine is...The world of Afghanistan and Africa are gorgeous. There is a constant 60FPS in the game. Its not The Order level of prettyness or epicness but really a very good game graphic wise. Everything is detailed. from the scars of big boss to his suit. The same goes with the other npc and characters of the game. A score of 10/10Music and Sound - As a game which won multiple awards due to its music. I would say it is deserving. the sound has a mixture of classic songs while also including the game's original songs\, it also has songs or main themes of all previous MGS title of the game which is awesome since you have both quality and quantity to boot. As to the sound\, voice acting is not impressive to me esp. Miller's which is annoying and his constant bickering like a mother in law is what really triggers my mood. Should have preffered Ocelot doing that job and not that freak. Venos Snake has little to no dialogue's \, Quiet has one\, while the others has few. Overall\, both has ups and downs but music is what really gave me that good feeling. A score of 9/10.Overall score = 8.5The game as a whole despite being great still was dissapointing for me since this game has the potential to be a masterpiece in that level that it would be revolutionary. The only ones at fault in here is both Konami and Kojima\, if they could have both worked out their differences then this game could have one of those memorable games ever. Well\, nothing we can do about it now since its done and the news that Kojima is out of Konami showed that we will never have a good conclusion to the MGS series. I really hope Konami doesn't destroy this series now since the mastermind is now gone. Still though\, I will always remember MGS as one of my favorite childhood game series ever.

You're usually kept on the edge of your seat\, as the tide could turn quickly\, and YOU can be the one to do it. Balance could be a bit better though.Also\, i have to mention how good this game is technically. Literally zero bugs or glitches\, buttery smooth 60 FPS with very rare drops. Graphics are probably the most photorealistic on the PS4.All in all\, an absolutely solid game that would definitely be worth your time and money\, it gave me around 100 hours (45% completion).You DON'T wanna miss this game.… Expand",true

As a first time MGS player\, it obviously doesn't carry much weight for me\, as it does for MGS fans. The storytelling style in MGS is not really something I enjoy\, to me the cutscenes and character behavior is just weird. I'm just gonna leave it at \""I don't get the artist's vision\"".All in all\, I feel like if this game hadn't been called Metal Gear Solid\, it would get far from the 10/10 reviews it's getting\, and would receive far less attention. And it's sad to see a game with so many flaws and so many shortcomings\, pull out these perfect marks in supposedly professional magazines\, and get these \""BEST GAME EVER\"" reactions.... No\, it is far from a \""best game ever\""\, and it's far from GOTY 2015. In the year of the Witcher\, Batman AK\, Bloodborne\, Dying Light\, the upcoming Fallout 4\, it simply doesn't have the quality to compete at this level.… Expand",true

85150,MGSVTPP,2015-09-02,10,"First of all I have been a Metal Gear Fan since 1987 . The series first appeared on the Nintendo entertainment system in the U.S. And on the Famicom entertainment system in Japan . The first metal gear game was a technical marvel back then . The game allowed you to do many things that were not possible before .This series is truly special and holds a place in my heart . Before I beginFirst of all I have been a Metal Gear Fan since 1987 . The series first appeared on the Nintendo entertainment system in the U.S. And on the Famicom entertainment system in Japan . The first metal gear game was a technical marvel back then . The game allowed you to do many things that were not possible before .This series is truly special and holds a place in my heart . Before I begin my review of the phantom pain I'll tell you why . My father hated video games . He deemed them to be mindless and wastes of time . My father was a career military man . He was very strict and did not screw around . One night after attending a church group with neighbors I came home late . He didn't hear me come in the house ( I guess that metal gear stealth training paid off )    I walked out into the family room \, and there was my dad . Perched in front of the TV NES controller in hand playing metal gear . I stood there and watched him for a couple minutes . He was having a lot of fun . I then said what are you doing ?. He hurriedly rushed and turned off the system . Unfortunately a few years later he passed .So now you know why this series is so special to me . It was a few years before I played metal gear solid on the playstation . I also played MGS2 MGS3 and 4 as well as VR missions . So basically I'm a metal gear veteran . I will not be revealing story or any kind of spoilers as you will want to experience it all yourself . Let me say this \, just the  prologue to this game is mind boggling and jaw dropping . Some of the most tense moments in gaming history are there . As I said I do not want to spoil it but it is nothing short of amazing .Presentation . The presentation on display here is simply astounding . The detail and love put into this game really shine through . The voice acting is top notch the animation is just ridiculously good . Sound and music are absolutely phenomenal. Graphically nothing else touches this game and as stated earlie the sound is great play with a good set of cans on .Gameplay . The gameplay is deep \, varried and polished . It's simply a joy to play through this title . Whether traveling on foot \, by steed\, chopper or bipedal mech there is always a ton to see and do . The depth on display here is staggering and your options on how you approach combat or the lack thereof is simply staggering . While I would say that MGS4 had more fan service moments Phantom Pain still shines brighter . As for cutscenes Kojima is famous for them . So instead of doing away with them completely he's made you the star of them . The transition from cutscenes to gameplay is indiscernible and is absolutely seamless . The control scheme is excellent though if you're a hardcore metal gear fan it may throw you off just a little nothing terrible though . Combat is smooth and satisfying to say the least . You can upgrade your soldier and Mother Base (your staging area ) to your hearts content . Netting you some pretty sweet rewards .Again the prolougue is one of the best moments I've ever experienced in gaming and I'm an old man . It rivals that of GTA5 and the Last Of Us that is really saying something . A legendary gaming series got the retirement it deserved it truly sucks that Konami and Kojima will be going their separate ways . One more thing I'd like to mention . There was a young man during development of the title who received a cancer diagnosis . The young man was a California resident and by my understanding an outstanding young man . Unfortunately he was very very ill . This young man wrote letters to Hideo offering his messages of excitement love and support for one of his favorite series in gaming . Hideo sent him all kinds of autographed collectables and even made him an honorary member of the design team . Saying Sean's messages of support helped motivate the team to produce this masterpiece . Unfortunately Sean passed away before release . Video games don't often have the kind of power to transcend barriers in that capacity . This is something truly special . It's not a game it's a work of art \, a work of love \, and a thank you to all us fans from not only a great gaming mind but a true gentleman and honorable man . So Hideo and Konami the divorce is final but thanks for all the truly special memories I salute you both rest easy snake you've earned it your 28!year TDY is over honorable discharge :)… Expand",true

85174,MGSVTPP,2015-09-06,6,"I simply cannot understand how this game is getting so much praise. I'm a huge Metal Gear Solid fan and I was really looking forward to it. But when I finally started this game\, playing the opening sequence I couldn't help but feel sort of numb to everything that was happening. Sure it was cool but something was missing. Only about 30 hours later and after nights of sleeplessness where I tried to figure out why I wasn't satisfied with the game it hit me. There is no heart to it. The gameplay sure ist pretty good and it is a lot of fun. The world's are empty though and Kojima Productions had no idea how to make an open world that is diverse and feels natural. The worst part of this game is without a doubt the story. The first chapter was somehow bearable\, although it felt so unfinished and things that got introduced were never explained or continued later on. The second chapter though is the worst part. It feels like they needed to throw everything they had left together just to make the story a little bit longer in the end. Quiet is an awful character and I don't feel ashamed for my \""words and deeds\"" about her attire but that I actually defended her all this time only to learn about the utterly stupid reason she's wearing a bikini in battle. I feel ashamed for playing this game when I see her weird\, hyper-sexual movements in some cutscenes and especially that stuff in the rain. The forced romance between her and 'Snake' that the story tries to shove down your throat somewhere in the middle of the game\, again with no build up is so painful and cringe-worthy to look at. Also there is nothing controversial in this game that hasn't been done in other games already. Children with guns? In The Last of Us you play as a child while you're murdering people. Now I know child-soldiers are a real thing but it's so weirdly implemented in this game and doesn't really add much. Quiet being almost raped and tortured? Well that is a bad thing but the fact that men get raped too is not acknowledged at all. These scenes just feel like the game is forcing you to feel sorry for her all of a sudden. Skull Face is a silly\, pathetic character that feels almost unimportant to the story. I could go on for hours. The thing that I hate most about this game is that stupid twist at the end that creates more plot-holes than it does actually explain something. It's just so stupid and unnecessary. There is no downfall of Big Boss. He doesn't become evil because of the events he has to go through. Finding out that you're playing as the medic from Ground Zeroes just makes me say one thing \""Why should I even care?\"" There are just so many things wrong with this game's narrative that it's hard to mention all of them.Kojima you f***ed up big time. The only sad thing about it is that all these talented people dedicating their lives all these years to make this game are never really acknowledged behind all the praise Kojima is getting. The presentation is phenomenal\, exceptional. Motion capture and cinematography is outstanding\, graphics are beautiful. The soundtrack is so memorable and always fitting and the gameplay is pretty good\, but all that isn't enough to save the game from it's poorly executed story and characters.… Expand",true

But then\, close to the finish line\, it stumbles and destroys every enjoyment I could have\, instead replacing it with frustration and Game Design decisions I just cant understand.Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain proves that you can never expect a good Game to stay good.But where do I start?MGSV does a lot of things right.+The Gameplay has never been this good in a Metal Gear Game. Seriously\, the sneaking is fun and engaging\, and the open world aspect makes you truly want to explore.+The graphical Quality is pretty good and this game runs at 60fps instead of the standard 30\, while also not feeling like it sacrificed visual quality for that.+The Game is Gigantic\, with me spending over 60 hours with roughly 70% Completion.+The Score has never been so perfectly mixed\, every single track feels like it belongs to where it is played\, and really makes some scenes really emotional.+The cinematics are beautiful\, engaging and really great\, making this one of the closest experiences to an interactive movie.This all sounds great\, doesn´t it? So why do I rate this game relatively low?-While the Gameplay is great\, it was never the strong point of Metal Gear Solid t begin with\, at least not for me. I always played this games for the Story\, and the Story in this Game is one of the worst in the series\, being played completely by the numbers and an ending that makes you feel like you just wasted all the Time you played Metal Gear Solid V.-While the Open world is pretty Big\, it also gets pretty samey pretty damn fast\, making you loose interest after a few hours already.And my biggest gripe:This Game takes the Peace Walker approach in storytelling in which you have a main Chapter that is pretty basic storytelling wise\, and an \""Epilogue\"" which is aimed to complete the Story. First of all\, reaching that ending is a chore. You are forced to replay Missions from earlier in the Game\, just on a higher difficulty Setting.Not only does that make no narrative sense\, But Metal Gear Solid V cranks it up to 11\, having missions where you can get One-Shot less then 1 Second in. No Room for Error\, no Fairness. That is not Fun\, just Punishing.It is funny that i would say this about MGSV\, a game in development for what feels like an eternity\, but it needed more Time. The Final chapter feels like it was meant to be accompanied by Gameplay\, but they had to scrap that and instead just recycled older levels.It is sad that it had to end like this. I truly wanted to Love this Game and for the Most Part\, it felt like this would be the best Metal Gear\, and a true ending to the Series\, but everything it left was an awful aftertaste.… Expand",true

Waiting for the long awaited GOTY 2015 has been hard and finally getting to play it as soon as it launched was a treat. However\, as many times as you see his name appear on every mission\, sadly\, this isn't A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME!Phantom Pain's fox engine is amazing\, showcasing a new era of open world fun that can be had in the 8th gen of gaming. However\, Kojima's so called conclusion to the epic saga is a big fail. MGS 5 is an open world game with mechanics picked up from Far Cry\, Splinter Cell & some other 3rd person shooters. What the game doesn't pick is anything from its previous Metal Gears.Metal Gear Solid 4 remains my favourite game of all time not just because of its amazing story but also its boss battles. And Phantom Pain fails to deliver on both. The game's story is left on a cliched cliffhanger and the game has a total of 1 Boss Battle. The hype with which i started the game died down each moment I progressed towards the end.The game is divided into 3 sections - Prologue\, Chapter 1 & Chapter 2.The prologue features some amazing cutscenes with chapter 1 featuring 31 missions to the finale. While some of these missions are really amazing\, most are repetitive and sloppy. The game's initial impressions make you say that its a GOTY\, however by the end of chapter 1\, you witness a boss battle which is nothing but a bullet sponge.(felt like i was playing a Destiny boss battle\, shoot rockets till death... urgh!)What's even more disappointing is Chapter 2\, which has 19 missions\, 12 of which are basically missions from Chapter 1 on higher difficulty which need to be completed in a specific way\, stealing away your freedom of open world tactical espionage. The way you want to play doesn't exist anymore in Chapter 2 which makes you question the existence of the open world.Metal Gear Solid 5 was the most hyped game of 2015 and Kojima does nothing but disappoint. I look back at MGS 4 and see nothing but laziness from Konami & Team in this game. A lack of boss battles\, the sheer lack of the amount of Kojima quantity cutscenes & the exact same missions in Chapter 2 makes me glad that i spent only $60 on this game and no more.Phantom Pain from no angle is 2015's GOTY & while i am not interested in Fallout 4 as of now\, i hope its much better than this.… Expand",true

Why is that? First\, it's an open world game. Now mind you\, I have nothing against open world games. Open world games can be a blast if done right. Since this is the first time Metal Gear has gone open world\, I had high expectations that they'd not only meet but exceed their competitors when it came to creating a world that you actually want to explore. I mean\, what is the point of making an open world game if it's not interesting to traverse? If you're not going to do that\, just make it a linear game like prior games in the series and perfect each space by littering them full of interesting things to see and do. And here is my first complaint with Metal Gear Solid 5. The open world is uninteresting. You have Africa and Afghanistan. Both overly brown\, void of much life\, and little to hold your interest while moving throughout the world. While there are side missions sprinkled throughout the world\, the side missions are\, sadly enough\, entirely filler content that does little to add to the game. Actually\, they sort of detract from the game overall. Instead of creating a linear\, narrative-driven Metal Gear Solid\, they've created an open world\, one that doesn't have anything interesting going on in it\, and then try to throw in some copy & paste side missions that are incredibly uninteresting and by-the-numbers in their design. But\, then\, the story must be good\, especially if you're a Metal Gear fan\, right? Wrong. For whatever reason\, Konami replaced their old voice actors with new\, more recognizable actors. For example\, instead of David Hayter\, we get Kiefer Sutherland. Not only does his performance fail in comparison to Hayter's\, he rarely even talks throughout the game. And here's another issue\, there's barely any cutscenes compared to the prior Metal Gear's. While I'll concede that prior Metal Gear's may have been overkill when it came to cutscenes\, but they've swung the pendulum so far from that that there's not enough now. I do agree that the gameplay here is solid and enjoyable\, but when the world it takes place in\, the narrative that surrounds\, and the extra content is so poor\, I can't give it praise that it simply doesn't deserve. If you're a fan of open world games\, this will disappoint you. If you're a fan of Metal Gear Solid's past\, this will disappoint. As a fan of both\, I'm floored that people are giving this game high marks. I can only surmise that it's because people were really hyped about it and now they're forgiving issues that they'll soon come to dislike. As is the case very often with people who play games and people who write about them\, they sometimes overlook glaring issues when they release and then only come to grips with the fact that the game wasn't all that years down the road.

Some gamers will find it the best MG ever made\, while others will see it as a big disappointment.No doubt its not a typical Metal Gear game\, and fans are complaining about the story (or the lack of it) and some changes made by Kojima.Its not a secret that Kojima wanted to move away from Metal Gear games. MGSV feels more like a spin-off\, or a side story. Make no mistake\, its not Metal Gear Solid 5\, its actually V. V might stands for Venon\, the major character in the game\, or for peace sign\, and indicates this game actually a sequel to Peace Walker.So\, in Metal Gear Solid V Kojima actually moves away from the traditional concepts of previous games. The story is not in front of you\, if I can put this way\, but its a disservice to say the game has a poor storytelling\, or even doesn't have a story at all. Its more like 2001\, Space Odyssey\, or like the first Alien\, where there is a big plot behind whats happening in the screeen\, but requires interpretation from the audience\, very different from last games where you can just sit and watch long cutscenes.That was a change I believe came for good. Metal Gear games always had a b-movie flavor\, with ridiculous lines\, over the top anatogonists and some way too silly moments\, that made impossible to take serious all the topics about death\, loyalty\, sacrifice\, nuclear ploriferation. The more serious topics sounded way too pretentious and made the whole thing sound as cheesy as cheesy can be.In Ground Zeroes\, it was already clear Kojima was changing MG's tone to a more darker and let's say mature tone. Paz\, a screaming young lady that happend to be the final boss in Peace Walker\, returned as a tragic character. The cartoonish David Hayter was replaced by Kiefer Sutherland\, and that alone make a huge difference. David Hayter performance was always unnatural\, forced and theatrical\, and was one of the reasons for MG games silly and cheessy tone. He was the perfect snake for a polygonal  snake from ps1 and ps2 era\, but with games getting closer and closer of movie's language\, a new Snake was required\, and Kiefer was the perfect fit for a tragic character like Venon.Some over the top moments are still here and there\, like main villain Skullface and Quiet's outfit (she happens to be a strong character\, despite the juvenille approach in her presentation during the whole game)\, but MGSV is a pretty strong game in terms os story. Its a tragic one\, that won't suit a happy ending. Its a story about loss and revenge\, about buddies departing and neve returning\, about your own identity getting stolen\, about living as a phanton of someone else. The main character of the game is called \""Punished\"". The Paz side story in this game give us one of the most powerful moments in video games story.The plot twist in the end of the game is Kojima not playing for the gallery\, as he did in Metal Gear Solid 4\, a game that actually ended Big Boss and Solid Snale story.The gameplay is stellar\, but don't approach MGSV as an rpg or GTA V game\, so you won't find civillians around the world. You are playing in large areas controlled by military groups. Every single mission you can approach the way you want. There is so much to develop\, the game hardly gets boring even after hours and hours of gameplay. You can go full rambo\, or you can have a 100% stealth experience.  Few games got companions right as MGSV. Your buddies are part of the experience\, and support coming from Quiet e D-Dog are crucial for completing some missions.Developing itens\, armor and weapons are more complex than many rpg games around\, since requires rational manegement of resources.Graphics are superb. There is no game around with better facial animations coming from characters. The landscapes\, specially in Afganhistan\, are amazing. Fox engine improved a lot since Ground Zeroes\, and its almost flawless here. The shooting experience is as funny as possible\, and a big for me was the 1st person perspective while pressing R1 button.Fulltoning soldiers and everything else seems something ridiculous at first\, but after a while\, believe me\, you will miss that feature in other games.The open world adds an element of unpredictabilty here. If you wait too long to make decisions\, the sun might appear and make everything more difficult for you\, even though you can speed up the time by somoking weird cigar. A sand storm might save the day and hide you enough time to complete an objective\, or a truck full of soldiers might appear in the base and force you to activate a plan B. Even of you capture an outpost\, that doesn't mean everything is safe\, since the soldiers of the next shift might be just arriving.The game's structure is a problem\, though\, since the \""Chapter 2\"" is actually a epilogue\, and most of main missions are actually repeated ones\, while some os best momensts are hidden as side ops.MGSV is my 2015 Game of The Year. A masterpiece. MGSV is Kojima at his best.… Expand",true

Let's analyze the f*** outta this game.I've been a hardcore Metal Gear fan ever since MGS1. Haven't played the 8 bit ones\, but I've read their plots plenty of times to know them like the palm of my hand.MGS1 was awesome. Incredible story for a videogame and amazing genre-defining stealth gameplay. It blew my mind.MGS2 blew my goddamn mind. Those graphics at that time. And the story... damn. Got Kojima'd so hard when I realized it had been a \""simulation\"" of MGS1...MGS3 was the best of the series. No discussion about that. Best cutscene/core gameplay balance\, and arguably most interesting and emotional story\, since it also sets the cornerstone upon which all of the saga is built.MGS4 was... dense. The story was a little bit convoluted and sometimes felt forced\, but its final act was so damn epic it redeemed it.Peace Walker was damn good too. Great\, great story and continuation of Big Boss' story\, loved the comic book touch\, and the episodic/mission-list structure of the game got along really well with it being for a handheld.Now... MGSV... The best gameplay-wise hands down. I've never had so many infiltration methods in my entire life. I felt like the true Big Boss when sneaking into an enemy base\, I had so many tools at my disposal... So in that sense\, it's a 10\, despite the fact that the \""open world\"" is just a vast (as well as beautiful) emptiness with corridors between mountains from A to B.However\, story-wise... it felt so weak. So uncomplete. So bland. Everytime the story seemed like it was getting somewhere\, like you were about to get into the real deal... it just... ended\, or took another route\, or dismissed it.Skull Face made for a great\, interesting villain in my opinion\, and its end is just so unsatisfying and anticlimactic.The battle with this game's Metal Gear comes too soon\, with too little build up.The Eli story arc and the psychic kid's story arc are simply half-way done\, unresolved. And even with that bonus\, half rendered scene that got deleted and comes in the special edition\, it simply doesn't feel like it has a proper ending.The only real\, satisfying plot that is resolved accordingly is Quiet's\, which I quite (lol) enjoyed\, but still\, falls short in comparison to say\, the Foxhound unit in MGS1\, the Cobra Unit in MGS3\, or Dead Cell in MGS2 (The B&B unit in MGS4 is just stupid. Sorry).Now\, the real ending of the game\, which admittedly\, is one of the BEST\, pops up in the mission list in such a disconnected way from the story that hurts. It feels that that final mission appears simply because it has to\, not because the player has been through enough or through so much that he deserves it/needs it.There is so little story in this game\, it's a shame it has the Metal Gear title. And the few cutscenes are so well directed and leave you craving for more than it's just adding insult to injury. The cassette tapes try to alleviate that\, but honestly\, many of them are just wishing be a cutscene instead.This game should really be a 9\, but it's a Metal Gear\, and as such\, it should be held to a higher standard. It's a 7'5/10\, rounded up to an 8 for its gameplay.PS: Enough of the credits everywhere\, Kojima. If I see \""Guest appearance of the Skulls ******* unit\"" at the beginning of a mission\, well\, it's a stupid spoiler. Now I know I will eventually face/see them\, so it will make less of an impact. What is wrong with you. Same goes for the 'trailer' after the end of Chapter 1\, which is just a huge spoiler\, because it tells you the whole chapter 2 story in a 30 second montage. What the hell man.… Expand",true

84536,MGSVTPP,2015-09-20,4,"As a huge and long time fan of Metal Gear I am for once truly disappointed. I'll start with the only good thing this game has\, the gameplay. The freedom to decide on how to tackle a mission is great. The buddy system is a new and useful addition. Being able to use vehicles is fun and all the equipment available gives the gameplay a high level of variety. Snake moves as smooth as he never did before and his new CQC and sneaking moves were long awaited for. Rebuilding mother base is rewarding but it just needed to be more lively. There is nothing much to do\, while the idroid has too much to do. The open-world is not the problem\, but the repetitive areas and missions are. What I think would have worked is set open sandbox areas to go to.Metal Gear is a game built by the story and everything else follows it\, but not this time. It seems all the key elements that define Metal gear have been taken away to appease to the majority of gamers that are only entertained with shooting. I've always felt that Metal Gear was one of those few games that was moving the gaming industry to evolve into art and no longer just be an entertainment medium. For this franchise in particular\, the story drives the gameplay and gives it meaning. As much as the gameplay is fun it soon falls stale because there is no story to give you purpose to continue on.Codec calls and cut scenes can be skipped so there was no reason to rip away more pieces of metal gear. I wonder why there can't be an even balance of cut scenes and gameplay to make the best Metal Gear possible. The game was advertised as the missing link to the saga\, the story of what led Big Boss to descend into a darker path and start Outer Heaven. Revenge was suppose to be a big theme but only Miller portrays it. The real Big Boss is not even there to seek revenge with his own hands. Instead we get to be his double\, in this story that doesn't add anything important to the Metal Gear saga. The shrapnel in his head is suppose to depict his change into a demon but nothing truly happens in the story to make him one. I think the story would have been better if we would play as both the real and fake Big Boss as they worked together to seek revenge and bring the rise of Outer Heaven. It would have given more room to include a larger cast of characters such as Gray Fox\, Naomi\, etc. The game is already set in Africa why not add more of Metal Gear history for us to see? Then it makes no sense to me that Big Boss would agree to use the Medic to be his double without consent. Big Boss was used himself in previous history and I find hard to believe he would do that when he believes soldiers deserve better\, hence Outer Heaven.Epic boss battles are missing\, which Skull Face should have been one. Skull Face's motives are not really portrayed and he seemed to have great potential to be a purposeful villain. Volgin's appearance should have been only to torment the real Big Boss and maybe Ocelot\, it has no meaning for any other character. Metal Gear always has its large cast of characters and this time it lacks that. If there was a good story to tell\, Quiet would have had more potential to shine. Wearing almost nothing wasn't necessary either\, even with her powers she could have at least worn shorts. Eli is just thrown out there with not much focus either and the same goes for Psycho Mantis.Instead of chapters\, the game should have just kept running in episodes\, with Skull Face and Metal Gear ST-84 being the epic finale. Big Boss should have been shown taking in child soldiers and actually training them for Outer Heaven\, therefore showing him change. The chapter where Diamond Dog soldiers must be killed to stop the spread of the parasites definitely could have been more dramatic. You only kill a few in the short chapter and Snake is not shown to be utterly broken by having the blood of his comrades in his hands. It also would have been more impactful if Skull Face would have done this rather than Huey. The need for revenge would have gone more deeper. As history repeating itself is a theme of Metal Gear\, Huey would have been just fine as the scientist who was used\, for old Metal Gear sake. The way it happens in the game\, Huey should have been killed but was not to avoid a time paradox.Overall\, the themes of revenge and race and rarely felt in the game. Then to add to the negativity\, pieces of the game were not included like the famous Mission 51. Cut scenes shown in some of the trailers are not in the game. This game had nothing meaningful to say (maybe that explains the lack of dialog) or show as the previous ones. It was a long wait for this game\, much anticipated because it is the last one\, only to end up in shock with what we actually got. A Metal Gear game that doesn't feel like one at all. I am left wondering what happened between Konami and Kojima that lead to the ruin this game.

I’ve attempted many times to get into the various titles after hearing for years what a classic the series is\, but I’ve never lasted longer than an hour in any of them. The gameplay was either too dated or the writing astoundingly bad.All that said\, I more or less enjoyed my time with this game (and Ground Zeroes). The gameplay was for the most part very well handled and implemented. The buddy system (especially Quiet) is a great addition and helps to add an extra dimension to the experience. The AI\, while not without its problems\, is among the best I’ve encountered and certainly added to my enjoyment. However\, the repetitiveness of the mission styles did get old after awhile. Fifteen hours in and it was starting to feel like a chore. It got to the point where I didn’t even care about my score or fultoning out potential recruits. I just tried to get the mission over as soon as possible. Going open-world with this game was also a mistake. Nearly every base is identical\, the areas in-between are cold and lifeless and the “man behind the curtain” feel of the design of the locations was very distracting and annoying. The size of the two maps felt like a waste of time. Most of my gameplay was probably spent getting from place-to-place (at least in the beginning) than on the actual missions. Mother Base is also another empty husk\, with only a couple things of interest there to interact with (I’m not an online player). The Side Ops were standard open-world fetch quests\, too; nothing new or interesting there.I’d also like to point out that while the graphics are good (especially facial animations)\, it is certainly not the best (or even among the best) of those out there right now.A key factor in my eventual dissatisfaction with this game was the story (or should I say the lack of one). Characters were endlessly lamenting their “phantom pain” and the constant harping on about revenge was tiresome. The problem was the plot never tried to delve any deeper and examine any of the issues that were brought up. Amputation\, memory loss\, PTSD are all ripe subjects that if properly handled could make for a very compelling story. But Kojima seems satisfied to merely pay lip-service to these themes\, and instead is more fascinated with lingering camera shots on Quiet’s exposed cleavage\, ludicrous supernatural elements and the numerous tongue-in-cheek easter eggs than telling any kind of coherent or plausible story. The absurd plot of the villain and the “twist” at the end undermined a lot of the gravitas the plot was trying to achieve. The tendency of the characters to constantly rehash and over-explain events that had just occurred was poorly handled\, as well.It also didn’t help that many of the characters just flat-out annoyed me. Miller\, Emmerich\, Eli & Skullface were absolutely atrociously written & acted and some of the most aggravating in video game history. I’ve never been one to skip cutscenes\, but I almost came close to doing it whenever these people were onscreen.A pet-peeve of mine in games is the silent protagonist\, especially where a lack of dialogue in a conversation is particularly noticeable and awkward. Taking orders from a subordinate because your character doesn’t talk is just lazy and dumb.The only reason why I play any game is for the story. I need a motivation and reason for the dozens of hours I put into gameplay\, otherwise it’s all just shallow\, forgettable busy work. I’m sorry to say that most of this game lacks any clear story reason to continue\, and the only thing that kept me going was the blind hope that there would be something at the end that would reward my perseverance.What saved the game for me and actually made my time with it worthwhile was Quiet. If you look past her ridiculous costume\, she’s the best thing about MGSV. When she was first introduced\, the fact that she doesn’t say a word (and that the game never explains how to utilize her as a buddy) left me feeling indifferent to her. It was only towards the end of the game that I came to honestly care for her. The dancing in the rain scene combined with Mission 45 (not the gameplay but the cutscenes) are some of the most beautiful and touching I’ve ever seen in a game.I only wish the exemplary moments in this game were free of the truly dreadful ones that accompany them. Quiet and her story arc is the only reason why this game is not the forgettable & awful entry its story destined it to be.This game (along with Ground Zeroes) is worth playing\, even for newcomers to MGS\, but only if you can rent it\, buy for $30 or less or are a massive fan of the franchise.PROS:GameplayGraphicsQuietCONS:Story/DialogueVoice actingRepetitive missionsEmpty open worldGrinding fetch quests… Expand",true

There are 20 additional missions after that 15 of which are repeat missions from the story under a much harder difficulty.  The extra 5 missions add a bit more back story to certain characters.   Mission 51 was cut from the game for whatever reason and because of that it has no true final boss fight..  Yet you can look it up on YouTube and watch it.   There are also additional hidden cut-scenes with pivotal information that isn't delivered to you by the normal means of playing the story.  I had to look these up as well.Don't let the \""Open World\"" fool you.  It is open to you where you get to pick how you go about entering a mission area and going about your goals.  Not lets say\, Fallout/Skyrim to go explore and do as you please.   You can still explore\, but it serves no extra purpose and does little to help you with the game.  There is only one true military base which I didn't like.  I enjoy close quarters MGS\, not open and able to pick everyone off from afar.  This made the game lose a portion of its essence.How much did Kiefer Sutherland get paid to record all of what\, 30 lines of dialogue?  Seriously\, he barely spoke through the entire campaign.  Ocelot is great and Miller just cries the entire time and has the worst dialogue possible.  THEY PLAYED US LIKE A FIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDLE!Upgrading your items though I liked a lot though\, from customizing your weapons to ordering upgrades.  Same for mother base and going into a camp and stealing there people and there weaponry is great. I found the balloon hilarious and a great tool for infiltrating a base.The combat is solid\, even though Reflex mode makes everything too easy.   What boss fights that are in it are okay at best and the Skulls offer the only challenge in these events.  I'm a stickler for sneaking and using darts for EVERYTHING.  I really enjoyed the sneaking portion of this.  Your buddies that you use in battle\, I loved all of them.  Quite will cause a corruption save issue if you use her on 28 or 42 FYI.It has Microtransactions in it for online pay\, which I can't describe to you how much this annoys me.  The online play has you infiltrating other player bases and stealing there equipment and people.  If your caught\, they can do the same to your base.  Microtransactions though\, why just why.If this game didn't have Microtransactions and didn't require me to look up the real ending and other major plot points on youtube I would gladly give it an 8-9.  In the end\, it is worth playing through and is worth your time and money.  V is about closing doors and providing you with additional information about what is happening where and what happens throughout the course of MGS.  Don't expect new doors to be open here.   Don't be surprise though when you beat it\, if you ask \""Did I beat it?\"".… Expand",true

It has a great vibe to it as well\, set in the 80's from Afghanistan to Africa\, both Areas being vast open areas to explore. This game has a great sense of humor despite its grim and dark setting\, From a wolf companion with an eye patch that wields a knife\, to using fulton to extract soldiers\, animals\, gun emplacements and specials and brutally smashing my fellow soldiers in the face with a bionic fist only to have them thank me and have moral go up.Gameplay is great as well. Whenever you are spotted by an enemy\, time slows down and gives a short period to react\, like getting spotted by an enemy soldier and using this short period to get off a head shot before he or anyone else can react. This game is all about improvising and rolling with your mistakes\, which means no manual save or load options to fall back on if you screw up stealth. You also have multiple \""buddies\"" that help you if you want them to. each have different purposes that support different play styles. Weather and time of day also factor greatly in this game. You could be be trying to get into a enemy base and a sandstorm rolls in\, reducing both your and the enemies visibility. Guards change depending on the time and depending on how bright it is during the day can affect how easily enemies can see you. even your clothes affect your stealthHowever I am surprised how much praise this game gets. This game feels empty. Afghanistan and other areas are huge with weather and day and night cycles\, but apart form side ops\, clearing enemy bases and hunting for herbs and animals there isnt really much else to do. Just going from point A to point B over long distances. These areas feel empty as well. there are no native populace\, just animals and enemy soldiers.The game get stale after a dozen hours or so\, with a lack of variety for missions.Also the game feels like it needs to be like a T.V series. For some reason every story missions is called an episode with its own pre and post credits. This is annoying for several reasons. One is that they give spoilers about who is in the mission. I want to be surprised when I fight the Skulls like the first time I met them\, not have the game say \"" special guest starring: The skulls parasite unit.\"" And for some god forsaken reason\, Kojima puts his name IN EVERY MISSION. \""Written by Hideo Kojima\""\, \"" Directed by Hideo Kojima\"". We get it. And Motherbase feels empty. apart from smacking your own troops around and taking a shower or driving to other parts of the base there is nothing to do with mother base. You can build more bases sure\, but for a small bonus. This was a missed opportunity to add more substance to the game with Mother base.Overall\, great gameplay and audio\, but lacks variety and feels like an empty sandbox with a few tacked on features like base building and a annoying mission \"" T.V episode \"" structure.… Expand",true
84561,MGSVTPP,2015-09-21,6,"MGSV is as annoyingly incomplete as it is magnificently polished. It is a true oddity to have a game that has such a polished game engine\, game mechanics and so many flawlessly moving parts\, only to have it fall right on its face in the story-telling department and characterization of all things.Slight spoilers: The story itself is packed with filler missions\, along with side-ops that are literal filler missions\, whilst failing to touch on any of that MGS storytelling greatness. The game is comprised of two major chapters - the first one is slow to introduce story elements\, whilst the second chapter is actually 70% of the first chapter's\, with a difficulty modifier. What you end up having is a slow-burning start\, a mid-game climax\, and then everything else trails off into insignificance. For a game saga that is beloved for its plot (and its whackiness)\, this unwhacky\, thoroughly uninteresting foray of padding and filler is not a saga at all. It boggles the mind that its prequels\, Portable Ops and Peacewalker\, were both portable \""mini-MGS\"" games\, far exceed this \""Triple-A magnum opus\"" in terms of story-telling and characterization.

Knowing that already the reverse engineers of the internet have found a ton of cut-out content just reinforces my opinion - I don't like this game as an MGS\, despite its many\, many merits.

Could it live up to the jet-setting brilliance of \""Patriots?\""  After such a complete wrap up\, was \""Phantom\"" even necessary?\""Phantom\"" travels back in time and follows the story of Big Boss\, nine years after the events of Ground Zeroes (so\, the 80s.)  You've lost an arm in a chopper crash\, and awake weakened in a hospital when the enemies come to kill you.  After a daring escape with the help of Miller and \""Revolver\"" \""Shalshaska\"" \""Ocelot\"" (yes\, his name is three nicknames) you venture to \""Mother Base\"" the ocean fortress you are tasked with turning into your own personal army.  And that's where things veer wildly from the other MGS titles.In all other MGS games\, Snake is dropped into enemy territory lightly armed and without much hope.  (Typical starting gear includes a communicator and a pack of cigarettes.)  Weapons are scarce\, as is ammo\, and must be used sparingly.  In \""Phantom\,\"" that's not the case.  Within the first 5% of completion you'll have a machine gun\, a sniper rifle\, a grenade launcher\, a wicked cool horse\, a chopper that can preform devastating air strikes\, and a base that can send in additional supplies as needed (C4?  you got it.  Ground to air missile launcher?  On its way.)There's a two pronged idea behind these innovations\, it seems.  The first is to turn Big Boss into an ACTUAL boss.  You are no longer the lone hero\, fighting against the \""powers that be.\""  You are the powers\, and it's a pretty cool feeling.  The second is to provide players with multiple ways to accomplish a mission.  For instance\, in older MGS games\, there were very specific ways you needed to clear obstacles.    Now you can clear them in any number of ways (tanks can be dispatched by grenades\, by airstrikes\, or by getting ahead of them and planting C4\, that way you're never spotted.)  I think the \""any route to victory\"" gives players a more immersive feel\, like they aren't bullied into one course of action\, even though some courses will be more fruitful than others.  For instance\, if a hostage is about to be killed\, it's best to create noisy distractions with grenades.  If you're trying to steal a valuable item\, it's best to move quietly and use tranquilizers when necessary.  It's more true to life\, this way.As far as game play goes\, I'll come out and say it -- \""Patriots\"" was better.   For one\, the roll has been completely replaced with a \""dive\"" move.  This means no more rolling away from enemy fire and into cover\, and no more strafe-rolling whilst aiming (a BAMF move in firefights.)  They've also eliminated some on-ground moves\, which is upsetting.  Aside from this\, game play is still solid (no pun intended.)  New innovations include \""crag climbing\"" (a lot of buildings have cracks\, which you can climb up) new driving controls\, and (obviously) horse riding controls.  They all work very well.There are issues with trying to insert a sandbox format into an MGS game\, though\, and this is where \""Phantom\"" suffers a bit.  For one\, the story doesn't propel itself\, which leaves you feeling kind of wanting.  What made other iterations so fun is that it felt like you were playing a movie.  You had to accomplish these difficult feats\, and after each one Snake found himself deeper in trouble\, deeper in enemy territory.  Now you have this kind of ambling feeling\, like you don't even have to participate in the story if you don't want.  Instead of being a soldier trapped behind enemy lines\, you're kind of like the world's meanest bully.Also\, Ocelot occasionally pesters you about spending too much money or needing more troops for \""Mother Base.\""  You'll feel like you're succeeding in MGS while failing at Sim City\, which is annoying.  Most folks shelled out sixty bucks to play \""Tactical Espionage Action\,\"" not Rollercoaster Tycoon with guns.Lastly\, the open world fails at making the true \""fortress\"" feel.  I think it's an overlooked aspect of prior games.  Breaking into the Speznaz base in MGS3\, or Shadow Moses in MGS 1 & 4 felt like a true military fortress.  All the good stuff (Rex/Ray) was hidden at its core\, which took hours and hours to reach.  There was a genuine sense of discovery and danger that escalated as you advanced.  The bases in 5 are much smaller due to the open world\, so breaking in kind of feels like holding up a McDonalds in comparison.  It just isn't as rewarding.  Not to mention Afghanistan's deserts aren't exactly eye candy.If \""Phantom\"" were the first in the series\, I'd give it an  8 or 9 out of 10.  But following \""Patriots\"" leaves a sour taste in my mouth.  This game is fun\, innovative and well executed.  But it's a considerable letdown from \""Patriots\,\"" and there's just no way around it.… Expand",true

It doesn't help that chapter two of the game is mostly a series repeat missions from chapter one with added conditions. That to me just comes of as lazy.The writing is by far the worst it has ever been. The plot twist wasn't handled well at all\, and sadly was supposed to be the game's saving grace. However\, the real problem is that the main story has serious identity issues.It wants to be a revenge story\, but Venom being a mute and never expressing or showing any reaction to things kills that vibe. It wants to show a journey of transformation\, but without a strong narrative it just comes off as Venom running around extracting the world at random\, then it wants to show origins\, but non of the sub plots are finished.A lot of the characters are haphazardly thrown in to make the cast seem bigger\, but the ones already there are bland enough as is\, throwing more bland characters that are written so poorly isn't going to make them seem better. The main antagonist is the most guilty of this.A lot of the story is told through in-game cassette tapes\, so if you want to understand what's going on; you'll have to sit down and listen to multiple tapes. This is atrocious and ruins the pacing of going from a high adrenaline mission\, to listening to a five minute tape that tries to explain everything with horrible writing.This to me is extremely lazy. Show\, not tell.This wouldn't be a problem if they weren't necessary to understand the story and characters.Peace Walker did it better in this regard. Since the tapes in that game enriched the characters and story\, but weren't required at all to understand the plot.That's not even going into detail how much cut story content was discovered after the release of the game.Also\, as of this review\, a recent patch came out for the game that penalizes you for playing offline if you ever went online with the new patch. How it does this is by splitting your in-game resources and currency to offline and online. So now most of your resources are stored online that you can't transfer back to offline storage\, essentially making the game online-only to some extent\, which is a disgusting move\, especially doing so after the game came out.All in all it's clear the whole team needed more time and rushed the story aspect.

This game's story has to be one of the worst I've heard in years and there's not even a satisfying conclusion to it all liked you'd expect from the final Kojima Metal Gear Solid game. And this is a huge problem because it makes the game feel unfinished when you combine that with the fact that Chapter 2 is just you replaying the same missions you already played on a higher difficulty. The games gives you a decent amount of options\, but the actual level design doesn't encourage you to stray from the norm and try new things unless you just spam headshots over and over because then soldiers will start wearing helmets. The open world is barebones\, lifeless and dull as well as a chore to travel with mountains that exist for no other reason\, but pure padding and to impede your way. On top of there is no variety in the environments that you encounter in the game apart from the prologue\, which strips all control from the user and is overlong anyway. This would be okay if the environments in the game were actually interesting like with previous Metal Gear games\, however MGSV's depictions of Africa and Afghanistan are as uninteresting as can be\, which is absurd(especially in Africa) considering the amount of landmarks and variations it has.

There are some excellent story missions\, which reveal themselves after about ten hours of play\, but they are in the minority and all tend to blur in one\, due to the repetitious structure and fetch-based objectives. It suffers from Grand Theft Auto 4 syndrome\, whereby all the quests are the same. Either: blow this up\, rescue this person\, or steal something. I lost count of how many times I’d go to rescue someone from an enemy camp and they had been moved\, causing me to search out again. It’s frankly uninspiring and lazy for such a AAA title.  After the 20th time of doing exactly the same thing\, it becomes tiresome.The game is structured like a series of episodes\, whereby you undertake missions inside the helicopter. Each mission and side quest have a series of tasks. A main task then usually four others\, which are optional – it might be the case that there is a blueprint for a new gun hidden inside a base which you can pick up whilst you are in the process of competing the objective. All of the missions are re-playable\, so you can go back and attempt to complete the optional tasks; there is a lot of replay value here\, if you can be bothered.This vast open world is the games achilles heel. As impressive as it is\, the decision to take the game out of confined environments is a huge mistake. It takes the tension out of the cat and mouse stealth\, if something goes wrong\, you can just run in the opposite direction until the enemy loses interest. This is the main catalyst for why the missions are so dull. Also\, not forgetting\, because of the open world\, it’s difficult to develop a cohesive storyline.The other problem with this open world\, mission style approach is that as a result\, there isn’t really a gripping narrative moving the game forward.  The game lacks a ‘real’ developing storyline. Metal Gear games have always been lambasted for the convoluted storylines\, especially with the 45minute cut scene in MGS4\, but I can’t help feeling they would be a welcome addition. Instead\, Konami decided to take this criticism of the previous title to heart and decide to let the storyline develop through a series of audio tapes\, which you listen to\, between missions\, in the helicopter. Without visuals to support them\, the audio gets dull quite quickly. Especially when some run into the 5minute+ mark. There are a few shorter cut scenes\, but in the main it just feels like an empty sandbox and occasionally a piece of story will come along that opens up the next missions. This mission based element makes the game more accessible in shorter bursts\, but it does unfortunately mean that it takes away cohesiveness. The storyline feels disjointed and like episodic DLC.Aside from it’s looks\, some good missions and attention to detail it honestly feels like a video game from a decade ago\, especially near the end\, you have to repeat missions in order to progress (just on a harder difficulty). This reeks of laziness and instantly made me turn my console off in frustration.Despite this criticism\, I did mostly enjoy Phantom Pain. It isn’t a ‘bad’ game by any means\, I had fun blowing up base camps\, rescuing prisoners and working my way through the flimsy storyline to find out what happened next\, it just felt dull in comparison to the other titles in the series. I enjoyed the majority of my play through and spent hours hooked. It’s an addictive experience.Sadly\, for a series that led the way in terms of innovative\, excellently constructed pieces of gaming culture\, this feels like a bit of a compromise. The previous titles in the series had a lot more innovation. Fundamentally\, it’s not a metal gear solid game that the fans know and love\, it feels like a cheap knock off\, or generic sandbox title with characters from the series.There are some truly memorable elements\, but they are fleeting. It is undoubtedly a missed opportunity and definitely a showcase of how to successfully screw up a beloved franchise and turn it into something completely unrecognizable from it’s source material and previous legacy. There are some improvements here and there. The controls and feel of the game are tightened\, it feels more refined\, but lacks soul and fun. It’s a labourious process and not one for repeat playthroughs.  This game is Kojima’s swan song for Konami. It feels like the game company either meddled with his creation or he has perhaps tried to create a game so westernized to appeal to a mass audience\, he has forgotten to add what made the previous games so special.… Expand",true

However considering Metal Gear Online\, i would rate this game a 6/10\, that's how bad it is.Metal Gear Online deserves a 0/10. I had some much expectations for MGO after playing its awesome single player but is was sorely disappointed. Metal Gear Online is the worst multiplayer online game i have ever played. I have to admit i such at PVP but i did not let that cloud my decision. MGO is worse that pay to win FPS games despite it not have much pay to win stuff!Lets talk about the game modes\, The 3 game modes include: Bounty Hunter\, Cloak and Dagger and Comm Control-Bounty Hunter is sort of like team death match with a little added feature-Comm Control is similar to capture the flag-Cloak and Dagger is unique but in my opinion the worst mode to play. Players are separated into 2 teams\, one team will have to defend 3 data disc using lethal weapon while the other team has to obtain one of the disc but is only limited to a silenced sleep pistol and stealth camo that will be temporary disableif one of the team members is spotted.Having played this mode for a few hours\, I can tell you that the defender almost always wins.Apart from the few and boring modes the actual game play is bad as well. Players get disconnected easily\, starting weapons are few and pathetic\, walker gears are overpowered and unacceptable\, the stealth camo class make the game chaotic and stupid and there is no aim assist whatsoever. It is extremely frustrating to play MGO as a beginner as one would be gunner down like no tomorrow with little to no reward for efforts. Maps are big and boring with players either exploiting the walkers are camping at high places to sniper players who just spawned or merely walked 5 steps. There is no order or reason in the game\, it is a mess. The ability to customize and create female characters are not even able to deem MGO worth your time. Its just that bad.I would still recommend that you buy Metal Gear Solid V: TPP but don't expect to get any worth out of such a horrible multiplayer game unless you want a reason to throw the television\, controller and the game disc out of your window. If you still want to play MGO\, prepare a huge jug of water\, too much screams of frustration.… Expand",true

If you have the PS3 HD edition (with Peace Walker)\, wait until this game goes down to it's proper price ($40-$30). The controls are laggy\, I have also had issues with some control gitchiness. It seems that sometimes\, the game makes you want to scale on top of an object (when you're really trying to hide behind an object)\, other times you will get spotted when you're trying to reverse direction while prone. It seems that they should just rename this game Splinter Gear Solid\, because like Ground Zeros\, they have seemed to have copied it completely.The game also suffers from major under-development in the maps. As this game isn't a true \""open-world\"" game. Heck\, it's barely a decent \""sandbox\"" game. The map designs are utterly bland. It's as if Kojima had another \""awesome\"" idea\, but the people actually working on the game realized half-way through that a fully open-world game would not work with the story they were trying to tell. You can tell by looking at a game that is incredibly linear. You're locked traveling from corridor to corridor (with maybe some short-cuts here and there)\, while trying to avoid CPs along the way.And speaking of the maps\, they are two\, and they are incredibly boring and bland. It's like they didn't even care to make it like FarCry. There are no tunnels\, no underground pathways\, and there is really no climbing. The last part of this irks me to no end\, the setting for the MGS games have always been some quirky\, alternate reality sort of thing\, where technology advanced way more than it did for that time. You think that they could've easily figured out a cool grappling hook deal? It would really make the mountainous parts at least a little entertaining. But no\, and this goes back to my theory that they realized that an open-world game would not work with their story\, you're limited to climbing two things; ladders\, and cracks along the mountain (and there are way too few of them in the game). As by allowing actually full freedom to the player would make most/all of their missions utterly exploitable. FarCry at least tried to make the map interesting! It felt alive\, you could talk to other people\, you had actual towns\, even the outposts had character. This game has none of that\, that is unless you call towns so boring that it would make Ben Stein jealous good level design. Needless to say\, I had gotten so tired of this that when I do missions now\, I complete then\, then teleport back to my ACC to escape the mind-numbingly-awful tedium of traversing such boring maps.A cool feature from Peace Walker are in this game\, the Deployable Missions. This is where you could send Motherbase soldiers out to complete missions for extra GMP\, items\, and other soldiers. They added in a cool ability to use these Deployable Missions to weaken the forces at the places where you could do missions at. This is a cool twist\, but then you realize that you could weaken the forces in; Afghanistan\, Africa\, and South America...Except you will never\, ever\, do missions in South America. Does this make any sense? It sort of goes back to the ongoing theme of how underdeveloped this game is.The funny thing is that after Mission 30\, you will basically end up repeating missions that you have done 15\, or so\, missions ago. Something's adding up to tell me that these repeat missions were probably South American missions that got nixed\, and to fulfill the \""50+ hours of gameplay!\"" They decided to go the lazy route and recycle missions you already beat. It's like they only had enough story for 20-25 hours\, then decided to stretch it out with recycles that could easily have been Side-Op missions. It's really discouraging of how this picture is turning out\, isn't it? For a game that is the last game the actual team of KojiPro (Kojima Productions) will make for the MGS series. And this was the result.On a good note\, the graphics look incredible. It feels like a next-gen game for the PS4. The voice acting is hit or miss\, but largely a positive. The story is really all over the place\, it's hard to keep up\, and the ending makes sense when you think about the Metal Gear games that follows this game. It's just that I could not really feel any connection to the characters. The game play could be fun (but the Splint Cell games has better AI\, imo). All-in-all I think this is a mediocre game with a lot to be desired\, so I'll give it a 5 and tell you to wait till the game drops in price first.… Expand",true

Naturally\, this can lead to gameplay problems and at the very least story continuity issues. For me MGS has always been about infiltration of a big base\, things going south and dark ulterior motives coming to light. All something MGS1\,2\, and 3 did\, departed from a bit for MGS4\, but theres really nothing like that in MGS5 you might as well be running around playing one of those terrible COD or MW games.Lastly\, I have to mention what a annoyance it is having to collect so many troops for mother base to \""level up\"" that department never mind the fact theres really no visual way to tell what soldier is good at what you have to monotonously \""scan\"" EVERY NPC to find out\, its trite\, repetitive\, and dull.These are all big parts of the game so to see them so poorly executed is astonishing.

SoKonami is a crap box company. With that said…Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (A mouthful) is a fun game. An open world stealth action game where it benefits to either capture your foe or make him work for you\, or kill everybody that is within plain eyesight. (ba dum dum) The fact that the game is an open world sandbox allows for you to take creative approaches on how you go about capturing a base. You can have a lot of fun making a bunch of noise and acting like some homicidal eye patch wearing maniac that is trotting through the desert killing every single person in their path (unless plot says otherwise). Or you can be some type of deformed James Bond. However which way you want to go about it\, you can do it.Multiplayer isn’t great\, capturing competitor bases and earning points that can be spent improving your base adds a challenge to the game. There is an assortment of weapons you can chose and develop. You have tiny fighting robots that make the game… interesting. The gameplay can be addictive once you get into it. But honestly there is a lot of good to the game. Considering it’s getting cheaper and cheaper by the day\, it’s defiantly worth the pickup.There isn’t a whole lot to be said. The creator is a troll that made this game to be a horror title than said it was a joke and it became this pleasure. Then with the whole fiasco with P.T. Konami and Hideo Kojima just seem to have different viewpoints as what a game can be. When you see what Hideo can do with a horror title it makes me hope that Death Stranding is the P.T. we didn’t get. But considering he said the game isn’t going to be a horror genre and something along the lines of action whatever I have my doubts.Anyway\, if you don’t care about inner game company politics and just want a good game to play\, you cannot go wrong with this game.Happy Gaming.… Expand",true

Sometime i wonder if reviewer ever played this game properly AT ALL?Remember that this is Kojima´s first Open World game. It is a daring attempt with a beloved franchise.. It goes ok but with a certain amount of failure as well.Probably the worst part is the story in the game. It throws you off from the very beginning. Obviously you \""are\"" chasing a bad guy called Skull Face that we got familiar with in Ground Zeroes. But it takes so many twist and turns and leaves more questions answered that solved.SPOILER:Who saved you at the Hospital?What is it with this kids?The oddball storytelling of Kojima is going overboard in this game. Lot of zooms and slo-mo cutscenes that rolls your eyes. \""God all mighty what it the point??\"". And the overall sexualisation of Quiet in every cutscene involving her. Close up of boobs and crotch.. come on. Is Kojima a little perv?It sometimes gets very comedic in places.The open world is nice looking but is already dated and preceded by many games since then. Stealth and open world CAN work\, and this game still holds crown since there have not been any games in this style since. but it limits itself of too many revisits to the same spots over and over again. In the end it all smells burnt.The Buddy system is a good addition. D-Dog is probably the best companion here\, The D-Horse is good for start but gets shelved as soon as you can take cars to your mission. (Go technology eh?)Quiet is most fun\, but she sometimes are dumb and can not keep her finger of the trigger when you go in all stealth. Sometimes i can grab a soldier and she just opens fire on him as i grab him. It gets annoying. She can be dumb at times. But a lifesaver when the heat rises in battle.But at times you just wished the game could be more sandboxed in\, and focused more on a story rather than having it all-over the place. Metal Gear Solid is the true classic\, how this should be. But Kojima took it to a way to big scale and made it very very messy.PROS:- Excellent graphics- Good controls (except crawling)- Buddy system.- Quiet and her cleavage.. (yeah why not)- Fun stealth but the dumb AI at times makes your job too easy.CONS:- A large open world sandbox that offer no variation.- Off-the chart and nonsensical storyline with little dialogue- Awful AI at times.- Homebase is a joke\, lifeless and terribly designed- Hard to take the game seriously at time.… Expand",true

I loved sneaking my way through an enemy village\, maybe tranquillize few enemies and hide them behind buildings\, or fulton and recruit them to my growing motherbase. Or I could've hide in the container of a truck and wait 'till it drives through the village and I'd remain undetected. Stealth in this game is the best you're going to get from any game out there now.Open world. I was never a fan of this idea. One thing in previous Metal Gears I loved was the change of areas. In MGS4 there was a lot different areas that were not big\, but it didn't matter as long as they differed from each other. In V it's just the same desert\, a bit of jungle-ish places\, which are cool\, for 10-15 hours. Then it's just the same view everywhere. Also buildings. This game doesn't have big buildings where you sneak in\, hide in closets or under tables/beds. Though there is one manor in the game\, where you spend 15 minutes to get in and 5 minutes inside. I for some reason really loved sneaking in buildings. Maybe it's just me.Story/content. Now this is the weak point of the game. Story isn't that bad but the way it's told ruins it for me; In other Metal Gear games everything you did on your missions affected the story somehow\, and it really felt like it too. Well\, in V Miller gives you random missions that don't affect the story in any way: \""Gather intel\"" \""Steal a truck\"". What the hell? In previous games every mission had something new to it\, something cool would've happened\, an unexpected boss battle maybe. But wait! Hear me out guys\, In V you also get a cutscene sometimes! And they're usually about interrogating someone. Yeah cool right? ..right? -KonamiThen there's this \""Chapter 3: PEACE\"" which apparently was removed from the game and it would've had some really important cutscenes to the story\, but then comes KONAMI that piece of poop company that didn't give Kojima enough time to finish that chapter. Or maybe I'm wrong and this is one of those Kojima's evil plans he so loves to do? Maybe we'll never know. Or maybe we'll get another open world MGS without Kojima.TL:DR Great gameplay\, ruined for some players with open world and crappy story telling.

Upgrading several things and buying new stealth or combat technology will keep you motivated. But on the other hand\, the resource gathering can be very annoying and repetitive.Unfortunately the quality of  the story is nowhere near its predecessors. It really feels like it was rewritten some times and also cut at some points. The potential it had is huge but wasted. While Kojima shows his directing strength in the few cut scenes you encounter\, you will see very poor storytelling by an ridiculous amount of audio log usage to explain important story elements. In my opinion audio logs and similar mechanics should only be used to explain unimportant background information but in this case you have to listen to almost every audio log. The most shocking thing was\, that it felt like you saw basically every cutscene if you watched the 2 or 3 trailers in the past years\, which is something a dedicated fanboy does :)Mission design will keep you interested for a while\, but in the end there is simply no variety in what you do. There are about 150 side missions and you do always the same things\, which in the end is very exhausting. Even more exhausting than any generic Ubisoft Open World game. There are some special side missions that are very good but the most part is just the same thing over and over.I think\, the project was simply too big for Kojima Productions to handle and that is the reason why it lost the spirit of MGS. Many people say that the game is perfect. In my opinion its flaws are just too big and too visible.… Expand",true

But I wouldn't argue it is an example of good storytelling whatsoever. The major difference is... you're not sure if MGSV is deliberately doing this\, or because things had actually been cut...

84426,MGSVTPP,2019-11-24,5,"Metal Gear Solid was the game that introduced my to action games. I remember it like it was yesterday I watched my brother play MGS1 on his PS1 console. Granted I was veeery underaged to play or watch such a game\, but that's in the past\, and not the point. Point is Metal Gear Solid is my very favorite franhise of all time. My right arm has a Metal Gear character mural tattoo\, I love this game to the very root of my heart and soul. This game was a huge disapointment to me\, and I tried to see it from an objective point of view\, but it's very hard for me as a hardcore fan.Right off the bat I was very angry they went with a new vocieactor\, and not the legendary voice of David Hayter. So I guess it was a good thing that Big Boss\, or \""medic\"" doesn't talk barely at all. Mechanicely this game is near perfect with some gimmicks I didn't really appreciate.The story tries to make sense and have a perfect closure\, to bridge the gap and the tell the story of why Big Boss became the bad guy in the eyes of the world. Why Solid Snake was sent to kill him in MG1 and MG2. Yet it fails to do so in my opinion. We didn't need to know about the body double\, and his reason. I wanted to play as Big Boss\, see his demons that made him corrupted. With maybe just a little CASSETTE TAPE on his clone and where he was stationed and what he was tasked with.The cassette tapes and why I put them in all caps is because thats one big stinker to me. A really\, extremely lazy way of feeding us the story with all these characters. It is understandable with some of these\, but come on.  I completed this game to a platinum (because it's a MGS game\, and I need to). Not one of these tapes caught my attention at all\, most of them just seem like collectible.It is too bad that this game is so highly praised\, because to me and many other MGS fans it was a letdown\, a slap in the face. I realise I haven't even said half of what the game has to offer. But I'm writing this in 2019 and everyone already knows. I just had to let some frustation out.This\, especially storywise and characterwise is my least favorite game in the franchise. It was a fart in the wind compared to MGS1 or MGS: Snake Eater. This is of course just my opinion\, and I truly wish for a better game. Even with Kojima gone I still hope we could get a MG1 or MG2 remake like they did with RE2 in 2019. Just don't give us another MGS: Survive. Ok Konami? They can't make a new MGS game without Kojima\, that's true. But I still think they can make a solid remake with the same story\, just current gen graphics updated.… Expand",true

They'll start wearing helmets (and send they're own snipers too!). It blows PW out of the water...at least in gameplay.Now for the negatives. And that is in\, you guessed it: the story. It is poorly-paced. Hope you enjoyed the first hour of the game\, as that's the only intense moment of the game for a while. You'll have to do 15-20 missions before the story picks up again. By this moment you lose interest. This is so unlike MGS. Plus the bulk of the story is told via cassette tapes\, so unless you listen to them\, you'll have no idea what's going on. They are interesting\, but I don't understand why they couldn't be cutscenes. I understand the controversy of this MGSV as we expected more from Kojima\, but it still has its moments. And there will be a moment that will blow you're mind. A moment only Kojima can pull off. Some will like it. Some won't.And the weapons...are fictional. Really? This was one of the things which made MGS appealing to me. I was looking forward to using Cold War weapons in the FOX engine. Granted\, they're all based on real-world weapons but still\, the immersion is ruined.Despite all the problems\, I would be lying if I gave this game anything below a 9. It is worthy to be played\, especially for the MGS fans. Was it unfinished? Yes. Could it be better? Absolutely. But still\, MGSV does bridge the gap to the very first Metal Gear.

It has its own in-game soundtrack that mixes pop songs with the game's score. It also has hours worth of audio logs. You can play all of these in the background while conducting missions. The game features celebrity voice talent and spot-on perfect motion capture. There are a couple of hours worth of cutscenes here.

The toolkit is massive and after 40-some missions I have not come close to using it all. The game has two enormous open world maps in addition to a few linear mission segments. I've read that this game was an $80M venture and I believe it.For\, the gameplay feature that sets MGSV apart from other games is the Fulton recovery system. You attach a balloon to something or someone and it then flies them into the air to disappear and return to your base. Thus your army can go from dozens to hundreds. Cleanup of sleeping bodies is also simple if you don't mind recruiting subpar soldiers. My favorite use is capturing vehicles while the drivers are still in them. Sorry\, getting off track. The use the Fulton recovery system to capture soldiers and materials is part of the metagame of building your base and unlocking new weapons and support abilities. You finally start to care about these grunts because keeping them alive might let you unlock that silenced sniper rifle.My few complaints\, which by the way are not worth the time it takes to write this paragraph\, are the seemingly aimlessness of Chapter 2\, weapons switching\, visiting the same bases too often\, and that one mission where you are swarmed by tanks and those tank drivers can spot you no matter how much your are crouched or how far you are away.

As the hours go by\, the player freely writes its own story\, building its base and choosing how to approach objectives thanks to a vast\, well designed open world and a whole panel of gadgets and weapons. Hopefully\, that's not all as acclaimed director Hideo Kojima\, in addition to these modern elements\, introduces into the game's structure everything we want from a Metal Gear Solid game: challenging bosses\, beautifully executed cutscenes\, jaw-dropping moments\, fourth wall breakings and a dense\, fluid narrative that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the final twist drops.But of course\, the famous game designer isn't the only one to provide great genius\, indeed\, what would be Metal Gear Solid V without Kojima Productions' talent\, experience and mastery of the gaming medium?

Replayability is low as well.Visuals - 7.5/10: Nothing mind-blowing\, but it's for the most part pretty to look at. Lack of color may bother some.Sound - 7.5/10 - Music\, whenever it appears\, is stellar\, and the selection of tracks on the radio is great.

Whether its \""extract this guy\"" or \""make contact with this guy\"" its the same thing.  The difference being that you are progressively infiltrating newer and tougher bases as you advance in the storyline.  So in that sense its not repetitive at all.The game did lose me on the story which is very unfortunate since before this game I only played MGS for the storyline.  Its what captivated me and kept me with the series for almost 20 years now.  Never the gameplay.  MGSV has me clocked in at over a 120 hours so far and I really enjoy this game.  Its online functionality with the FOBs is a good addition to prolong the experience.  And with MGO3 around the corner it can only get better.  I was upset the story didn't live up to previous MGS titles but its easy to gain an appreciation for the individual cutscenes in the game due to their direction and cinematography and just how cool they look in general.  The melodrama is still there.  I think the pacing was off.  Too little story.  And I found myself not caring for any of the characters\, including the ones we're known from before (Ocelot\, Miller\, etc.)  I also really disliked the twist.I think the biggest issue I have with the story is that it felt like all the trailers leading up to the game painted a very different image than what we ultimately got.  Every trailer was edited in a way to imply that Big Boss is going through a difficult time and ultimately this breaks him.  You saw tension in the trailers (and in the game) between him and Miller but ultimately that amounted to nil.  The twist at the end was bleh...I had to use hypnotic suggestion to forget it completely (thanks Ocelot).I guess not the grandeur of MGS storytelling we've come to expect but all in all its alright.  Which is very unfortunate.  But story aside\, the game is awesome and there is plenty of gameplay there.  I look forward to Kojima's next game because its obvious he's had enough writing about the MGS universe.… Expand",true

Some buildings can look bland\, but this is far and few between. The use of lighting plays a huge role with the detection system and enemy vision cones (which is no longer visible)\, coupled with a camo system and noise system creates a nice marriage of mechanics to make sneaking more natural.

Solid shooting mechanics and a great buddy\, weapon\, helicopter customization system.Bad: Not a lot really but there are a few points.

It goes without saying at this point that I rate the game 10/10\, however this is not to say that the game is flawless. One of the main gripes i have with the game is the fact that once you are in the map\, there is only two ways you can get from 1 end to another. 1: you can run/ride there 2: you can use your helicopter. however this issue with number 2 is that in order to use your helicopter to get from one end of the map to the next you will have wait through 2 loading screens. However this issue is something that can probably be patched in the future. The second issue that you may experience with the game is that it seems as though the over-arching storyline takes a backseat to the episodic storylines you play though. This is something that may dissuade the more \""hard-core\"" metal gear fan\, however i personally found every side mission to be fulfilling.

From someone who understands and follows almost all of the Metal Gear/MGS Canon and real life issues of the series.  I'll share my perspective and will hopefully persuade you to pick this up.MGSV picks up right where Ground Zeros left off.  (Haven't played it?!  No worries there is a recap\, recommend you watch that if you haven't)  Right away the game throws some seriously disturbing twists at you.  As a fan\, they hit you hard\, but only adds to the compelling narrative to follow.As a story\, it truly does start out strong and ends with you feeling bitter.  However\, this is where you should look up the cut material from the game.  (Which essentially is a key part of the ACTUAL ENDING to the game and helps to further explain all of the questions left unanswered)As for gameplay\, this is the best stealth/3rd person shooter out there.  It runs beautifully\, loaded with plenty of unlockables\, online gameplay\, etc.  First\, the Fulton system gets old and seems to distract from the purpose of the game\, which is stealth.  (This coming from someone whose played Peace Walker to 100%)  Mother base exploration is cool at first and later pretty bland.  Last\, are the buddies\, although they are optional to use; they eventually make the game too easy.  Sure\, they are handy\, when your taking care of those side ops\, but they tend to make the main ops less enjoyable.In comparison to the other titles.  The main ops are best out of the series in terms of a challenge and how creative they are to sneak through.  Story wise its on par with Metal Gear Solid 2\, which was good but a little sloppy.  Overall the presentation with the cutscenes are the most beautiful\, but I'd still put MGS4's above it\, artistically.… Expand",true

MGSV is a breeze to play and I felt at no time challenged on default difficulty. While the optional use of the iron sight addition makes the take downs even easier. How to recruit people is silly fun\, but also so super dumb.A open map with a padded travel system and rinse/repeat missions is so boring in stealth.

For those of you not familiar with the type of story and characters of Metal Gear games they are ludicrously science fiction bordering on fantasy at times. Historical (science) fiction fantasy? Yeah\, let's call it that.Pros:-Taking down guard posts/completing missions are satisfying and open to player agency. This means stealth and gung ho guns ablazing but most likely a mixture of the two.-Mother Base\, your very own fortress! You can recruit soldiers for it via abducting enemy combatants (to be brainwashed) and building up enough of a reputation that they want to join you. These soldiers are divided into units based on their specialty. Each unit has a level based on the composition of its soldiers and you will see the effects of that level in game. Units include: medic\, intel\, development\, fighting\, etc.-A whole bunch of gadgets and upgraded weapons to be researched once you level up your development unit.-Buddy npcs that accompany you in the field such as a dog\, a sniper\, a horse\, and a tiny metal gear! All of which can also be upgraded. There is something special about training your dog to stab a man to death.-Cinematic cutscnes-Beautiful graphics that the game screams at you to notice with the many helicopter take offs and landings whose true purpose\, I suspect\, is giving you a vista to appreciate.Cons:-REVENGE!!! How I hate the revenge plot and don't be fooled by any convolutions this is a story about revenge. One of the characters in particular goes on and on about it.-I have minor gripes with the story and characters but those are issues are not worth discussing because they are only issues if you are a fan boy and if you are a fan boy you are going to play this game anyways.Conclusion:-It's a game that can best be enjoyed after having played all other metal gear games. Understanding all the nuances and nods to past storylines (or future storylines) is hard enough for somebody who has played all the games yet alone to a newcomer. But at least now there is more game and a great game at that. I'd recommend it to anyone. Worst case scenario most of the story will go over your head (as it tends to for most) but unlike previous games you aren't sitting through a movie with pieces of game. You are playing a game with pieces of movie. So buy it. Enjoy it. Maybe become a fanboy.… Expand",true

The gameplay however is the main focus in The Phantom Pain: with the Open world it allows you as the player to infiltrate on you're terms. To further let you go wild is the countless weapons\, tools\, items\, supply drops\, helicopter support\, air strikes\, and of course the cardboard box. the game also allows you to bring along four companions\, D horse\, D walker\, D dog\, and Quiet. Build up mother base by fulton extracting soldiers and resources you find in the open world. GMP allows you to develop weapons and tools\, to outfits\, to equipment for you're buddies\, to supply drops to the field\, to building platforms for mother base and ETC. All of this allows you to play the game how you want to play. Want to fly in on your chopper gunning down enemies\, shoot your way in\, call in an air strike and shoot your way out while Quiet picks of enemies from a distance with her sniper rife then jump on the chopper and ride off in the sunset while the air strike finishes the job? or sneak your way through using D dog to sniff out enemies and tag them for you as you slither your way through\, unseen hiding the body of the soldier you just put to sleep in a dumpster or porta potty\, and use the cardboard box to hide in plain side while you wait for a truck to hop in the back of while it drives you into the heart of the base? use D dog to distract\, kill\, stun or wound the guard in in your path? the possibilities are endless. The Phantom Pain is by far my favorite Metal Gear Solid. it is a masterpiece  and is my Game of year of 2015. I you are a fan of the series like me or just getting in to it\, you will love this game. 10/10… Expand",true

The Metal Gear series has been one for the ages. They will never been forgotten\, and will never stop getting played. Metal Gear Solid 5 does a great job of rounding out the series as a whole. They could have taken the safe route and kept everything the same\, but that isn’t Konami’s style. Although Snake wasn’t really Snake without David Hayter’s voice\, they did an great job are sticking to the series roots while creating an open world nobody expected from a MGS game.Sound:Music does wonders for a game\, and music has been exceptional in Metal Gear Solid\, adding to the drama of the story. Also\, gun play sounds incredible in this game. While playing on surround sound\, I could feel the power behind a gun just by the sound of it. Voice acting was great\, but based on the standards set by past Metal Gear Solid games\, MSG 5 ranks lower in voice acting compared to its “ancestors”.Graphics:Metal Gear Solid is one of the best looking games on the console to date. The fluent movement of characters\, the surrounding environments\, and bright explosions make Metal Gear Solid 5 an experience\, rather than a game. Cut scenes nearly look real with the right lighting and expensive televisions. Good luck topping these graphics!Gameplay:Metal Gear Solid has always had great gameplay. The controls are easy to learn but so complex at the same time. I beat the original Metal Gear Solid without the knowledge of using CQC. But that is the glory behind MGS gameplay. You learn more and more while gaining experience. You literally feel like a training soldier\, while “winging it” on a mission with so many different approaches. If you want to sneak around and not shoot a single bullet\, go for it! If you want to shoot every enemy you see\, that’s an option too! Splendid gameplay Metal Gear Solid 5. Bravo.Replay Value: Very HighStory:Although they did not continue the deep and rich storytelling before the past games\, the story keeps you engaged throughout the experience. They do a great job of filling in gaps of the Metal Gear series\, while keeping gameplay as its main focus. Metal Gear Solid has always been rich in storytelling. MGS 5 traded that in for deeper gameplay\, customization\, and an open world. Hat’s off to Konami for doing so. Doing this did not destroy the game at all. It certainly made it different than before\, but it worked and I was excited to experience it all the way through.… Expand",true

At a certain point you are FORCED to build this thing called an FOB (forward operating base). Once you build this FOB\, people can start attacking you and stealing your stuff. At first I was like \""sure fine whatever\, its Clash of Clans\"" but the thing is you can NOT get away from it\, EVER. People can take your stuff when you are off line. There is no way to say \""I don't want an FOB\, I just want to play MGS\"". If they wanted to put in game multiplayer I would have been fine with Peacewalker style co-op even though it made the game easy as hell but this is something no one wanted.

I've played over 25 hours and still at only 20% complete+Characters and Cinematic scenes are\, as always\, top-notch work+Buddy system allows for backup on missions and side ops. Quiet is very handy to have as cover fire.Negatives:- Huge open worlds are pointless if theres barely anything in it. Both Africa and Afghanistan are huge in area but little in content. Small outposts and bases are spread wide leaving the map with about 70-80% wasteland.-Side ops and Mother Base staff management become crucial without the game notifying you. I spent a long time defeating a boss only to find that I needed a Transport Specialist staff member to complete the mission\, a fact the game did not inform me of. Another frustrating hour of searching the internet and the maps for this specialist ensued.-Narrative is badly paced. After the prologue it was hours before I progressed the story in any way. Metal Gear Solid has always been excellent example in a narrative driven game but TPP doesnt seem to have much story left to tell and it seems like its a side story to the missions.-Hiding is just pointless in this game. Another key aspect of previous MGS games has vanished. Once you've been discovered the only way of dodging enemies is by fleeing mainly because there are very few places to hide.This is really a 7.5 but for a whole number rating.-Health and Supplies are a huge annoyance in this game. There aren't many supplies around when you need them and the guns cannot hold a lot of ammo meaning you need to constantly call for supply drops. Old system of being able to have all the weapons is gone and replaced by a loadout of 4 weapons max. Also have to hide for long periods to wait for your health to recover instead of using rations while annoying blood spatters on screen reducing your visibility.-Micro-transactions.

After the first hour the story just goes away\, most of what is left is in the tapes you listen to and then a 2 min cutscene is sparsely dotted around every 10 hours or so.  There are no characters like you had in the other games\, everyone is largely forgettable\, the voice acting for the male actors is bad\, they all sound too similar. There are no boss fights as you'd expect from a MGS game\, no moments like you had with The End in MGS3 or Psycho Mantis from MGS.The world is empty and really annoying to travel through since you constantly have big rocks stopping you from going places\, it really feels more like a series of funnels. All the content is in the outposts\, but they all have the same objectives of sneak past guards to get to something to either kill or extract. They never do anything clever with the gameplay\, it always plays the same and I got bored quickly. The previous games were much more like Mario where Nintendo constantly finds new things to do with the gameplay with each level. However in MGSV It's like doing Hideouts in Watchdogs over and over again. I don't even see why the world is there\, it serves no reason but for you to travel across\, which is boring. I'd have much preferred a single location like the Tanker in MGS or Shadow Moses\, at least then the map would have character\, rather than the generic outposts of MGV.The controls are very clunky\, it doesn't control well at all\, there is no jump button either so you'll constantly get stuck on trying to negotiate Snake over and around them. Constantly I found myself in prone and not able to get Snake to turn around\, so I'd end up just having Snake moving backwards all the time\, which mirrors left and right and that is so annoying.I think MGSV is a very mediocre game\, it's like Kojima got Western open world game envy and decided to copy it. It's not satisfying with the story\, which to me is the biggest crime since MGS has always been about the story. Why make a big deal out of getting Kiefer Sutherland if you aren't going to use him? I swear I only heard him talk like 5 times  throughout the game.I fully expect a backlash to happen\, in the same vein as GTA IV.… Expand",true

The various ways to combat missions and how the enemy adapts keeps things fresh and increases the replayability.The controls are very smooth as well\, the 60fps surely helps and the frame rate never drops. In a massive game like this it is admirable.The depth of the game also is very good\, from weapons and base building to the various staff members with their own skills and attributes. Side ops and dispatch missions also helps add depth to this game. The base building mecahnics and currency is done well and very balanced\, it is rare that you will need to grind for certain items\, but people would do enjoy going on extra missions get rewarded nicely. Very different from the traditional MGS games\, this is a game that is very friendly for newcomers.Which leads to the one controversial point you could say. The story. As a long time mgs fan i'm somewhat disappointed\, not so of the 'twist' and body double but because we never really saw the darkness and the theme of revenge that Kojima promise. This was meant to be where we see BB transition to a darker person\, according to Kojima and the build up to the game. And i'm left feeling that the ending is very open and it doesn't seem like a game to close the series to be honest\, storywise that is. I may have been expecting to much of the story (maybe a bit of SS vs BB would've been a nice touch) but again that is down to me just being a long time fan. Also due to a lack of memorable boss fights and cutscenes i can't help but feel this is the most un-MGS game to date\, not necessarily a bad thing as it still is a brilliant game\, but some of the older fans may not enjoy this new style. After investing years in the other games and their twisted complex stories\, this one falls short on that aspect.Overall it still deserves a 10 and possible could be GOTY\,  the positives far outweighs the lack of story\, of which i think only heavily affects long time MGS fans.… Expand",true

While there are still hiccups here and there overall the ideas surrounding the gameplay and the execution into the control scheme is fantastic. However\, with the continuation of Big Boss' storyline\, fans of the series had some expectations of this title.Personally I expected something similar to Snake Eater and Peace Walker joined together. And while for the most part the more realistic take on the franchise is refreshing (e.g. having to use supply drops for a change in weapons and camo\, as opposed to having magical pockets)\, the game suffers in many ways that make me nervous of calling this a true sequel (or prequel) to METAL GEAR SOLID.1. Where is the plot? I find it very strange that Kojima gets Kiefer Sutherland to be Big Boss\, which actually fits very well\, and have barely any lines. With that said\, he has Troy Baker playing Ocelet\, and while he speak more than Snake he still lacks any real character.That is pretty well it. The gameplay as I said is great\, it is the best gameplay we have had in the franchise. But what makes a METAL GEAR game? Plot\, story\, cutscenes. Ya sure sometimes cutscenes in MGS IV dragged on\, but the idea behind the cutscenes in all the SOLID games is that they create a real feeling of weight to your actions. All the Volgin stuff in Snake Eater\, it makes you see how evil he is\, how he needs to be taken care of. While Skull Face is arguably the main villain in this game\, I never feel like he is really all that bad. I never feel that I should get on with the main story because barely anything happens it seems. Stuff just sort of pops up\, but it never feels important. Also the twist ending is like a kick in the teeth to every METAL GEAR SOLID fan.I don't know what Kojima was thinking with this game\, maybe he wanted to get a portion of the Skyrim or Witcher crowed\, but ultimately this game pales in comparison to Guns of the Patriots. This was supposed to be the story of Big Boss' descent into the man he became\, the one who tried to use METAL GEAR against the world\, to fight against the governments of the world.
