The art design is absolutely breath-taking\, both graphic and music.2) Very interesting combat system. Some may say this isn't like previous soulborne games. However\, basically those games are all about when to dodge and when to hit\, and sekiro changed it into when to deflect\, when to jump\, when to use your umbrella\, etc. I think this is some kind of upgrade.3) There's no level system. You spend skill points on actual skills. Some people may not happy about this\, but the level design will actually ruin the difficulty design of a game. And here I'm actually fighting instead of farming XP for 3 hours.4) The story is always astonishing\, and I can gather more info in this game now. After the first playthrough\, I can tell the basic events happened in this game. But there's still more info requires my attention. While in Dark Souls or Bloodborne\, I need to watch YouTube videos to help me figure out what the heck had happened.Bad:1) Frame drop on PS4. This is absolutely a demanding game or they just did't do enough tweaks. The frame drop is a big problem. On ps4 sometimes the frame drops down below 40 and most of the time it's fixed between 40 - 60. Don't worry there's no dramatic frame drop in any boss fight but this is annoying.2) Stealth system doesn't work as I expected. This stealth system is not bad\, but sometimes enemies can hear you through any kinds of walls. Sometimes enemies can see you thousands miles away. Even though you hit them while hanging at the cliff\, they won't attack. I know this is the first time FS actually put the stealth system into a game\, but dude it's lame.3) This game is QTE after multiple playthrough. Enemy attack is not THAT various. Once you figure out what enemy will do and what is exactly helpful\, this game is QTE to you. It's still tough I admit\, but way more easier. But this only happens after multiple playthrough and this is not really a big deal.4) Useless skills. As I mentioned you spend XP on actual skills. However\, there's a lot of skills actually unhelpful. They are useless. You may find them helpful but in the end I unequipped all the skills and tools except my umbrella.TL;DR: Sekiro preserves the all the advances in the previous soulsborne games and sometimes exceeds them\, but frame drop on PS4\, lame stealth system and tons of useless skills disappointed me.… Expand"

The final boss took two nights and three days. However\, in the second through\, I could defeat final boss in the third tries. Sekiro never get stronger\, but I did."
84283,Sekiro,2019-04-25,3,Extremely disapointed. Its a repetitive boss grind game with a boring character and a boring lore in a boring world. How could From Software gone so wrong after all those lovely souls games? I wanted to love it but im shocked of this failure. Its a game for masochists not for people who love fun games.
84323,Sekiro,2019-04-10,4,"Ridiculous difficultly. Not as in \"" you need to practice to get better\"" difficulty\, but the \""you must memorize poorly constructed button inputs\"" difficult that makes the game less fun."
84324,Sekiro,2019-04-15,3,"As most are saying\, big fan of FromSoft's former games. The challenge of their games has always been offset by a community approach\, and is the ONLY reason I played through DS3 through NG+5. If DS had been a solo mission only I'd have stopped playing probably after the first go through. This is where I'm at with Sekiro. It's not a reward that's worth the effort. The grappling hook andAs most are saying\, big fan of FromSoft's former games. The challenge of their games has always been offset by a community approach\, and is the ONLY reason I played through DS3 through NG+5. If DS had been a solo mission only I'd have stopped playing probably after the first go through. This is where I'm at with Sekiro. It's not a reward that's worth the effort. The grappling hook and stealth are fun\, but compared to Batman and Spiderman type games they fall short of being new or exciting. They did a lot of things right with the game tho. The speed at which you traverse the environment is nice compared to their former titles\, much more fluid and fast feeling. The area's are beautiful\, and the buildings and clothing are really cool looking. In fact\, because of the amount of detail\,  there has been a lot of people not on 4k or super great computers having issues with framerate. Easy fix on PC\, not so much on console.  The fight mechanics are so close to being really fun. The deflect mechanic in particular\, it's easy to do and hard to master. The action on screen versus the button press was made just a little off. And trying with 3 controllers\, block just doesn't come up sometimes.  If they didn't do this\, everyone would be deflect masters and the game would not be so punishing. It feels like a cheap way of upping the difficulty. As does a lot of the bosses dropping target and Sekiro suddenly facing the wrong way and having a boss that can 1-2 hit kill landing directly behind you. Some of them are frantic. One of my absolute largest beefs with this game is the divergence of game play versus boss fights. Traversing through an area using stealth is all well and good\, feels very 'shinobi'\, which seems to be the point of the game\, but all that is useless against the bosses. In several of the fights you're in a tiny area locked behind magic fog once again and none of the game play has prepared you for the fight. There were no minions along the way that mimicked the uber moves of the bosses\, no tactics really that make you feel like\, ok\, I've been learning this and now it's test time. The game is hard\, we all knew it would be. But there's difficult with reward and without reward. This is without reward. With only 2 exceptions every boss I've finally managed to beat made me turn off the game and go do something else because I'd had enough. Sometimes in DS3 I would go back a little ways after a challenging boss/area\, throw down a soap stone\, help someone else out or party up with a friend just to mess around in the world and try new things out. Which was also a nice way to replay bosses that were fun. There's none of that here. It's you\, alone\, in a room playing a single player game that is coded cheaply to make it more challenging than it actually is through timing and engorged hit boxes. I was super excited for this title\, preordered months ago\, and now after beating Shinobi Owl I'm not going to bother finishing the game. I simply don't care to put any more time into it as it is unrewarding. The allure of 'seeing all the endings' is also an outdated method of getting people to play more. I would say to anyone interested prepare to play alone\, be challenged\, and if you can't connect with the deflect timing quickly you're in for a rough ride\, as you'll likely sneak around areas feeling like you're getting better and then end up face to face with things you can't hide from. If you can find reward from it\, great. I envy you!… Expand"

An average\, rough-around-the-edges project with a sparkle of potential\, but it's not\, it's their newest game. It is severely lacking content and features compared to previous titles\, and a narrative seems to have developed where comparing Sekiro to Dark Souls or Bloodborne is taboo. Thing is\, it IS Dark Souls\, all the major hallmarks are there\, but with a different coat of paint. You have shrines instead of bonfires\, but they serve the same purpose. Enemies respawn if you die or rest\, even the item descriptions and the wording of those descriptions is almost identical to items from Dark Souls or Bloodborne. Comparison is inevitable and it works to Sekiro's detriment as it simply does not measure up.What I absolutely despise about this game is the extreme narrow approach to play style. You have one weapon\, a few gadgets that serve VERY specific purposes and some special moves\, none of which have been terribly effective so far. I'll admit I never really got \""gud\"" at the Souls games\, I enjoyed playing them with my friends\, I enjoyed co-op\, strength builds\, miracles\, playing my character my way. But not Sekiro\, oh no. You must parry. It is the only way to play the game. I've never been a big fan of parrying\, the PVP community from the Souls games absolutely soured me on the whole mechanic. I think it's cheap\, dishonest and essentially shuts out any alternative styles.Sekiro suffers from it's lack of leveling up. In Dark Souls\, if you were struggling\, you could grind a bit\, increase your health or your strength or pump your spells a little more. You could upgrade your weapon\, or try a different one. Sekiro has no options. One build\, one weapon\, one technique\, rinse and repeat. It's dull\, it's not challenging it's just tedious\, more about rote memorisation and pattern recognition than adapting.Plus\, the game doesn't play by its own rules. Early on\, I came across a...mini-boss maybe? A big samurai guy that needs TWO death blows to kill. I figured I could get the first one with a sneak attack\, and after trying and failing a couple times to fight him face to face I thought I'd just grapple away\, wait for him to stop aggroing and sneak attack him again for the second deathblow. But no. He regenerates completely. The game has just said \""No\, play it OUR way\"". Even though Wolf is a sneaky shinobi man who uses trickery and subterfuge\, except don't use trickery or subterfuge\, just parry you scrub.So that's why I'm giving Parry Souls: Shadows Parry Twice a 4/10. This might be a 5 or 6/10 if it was a different studio\, but FromSoft can do and have done better. This is a step in the wrong direction for them. I refuse to praise this stripping away of content and options as \""trying something new\"". New isn't always good.… Expand"

Sekiro is a masterclass in both visual storytelling and satisfying melee combat with a progression system that whilst not as expansive as the Soulsborne games is still expansive resulting in different skill combinations (At least in the first playthrough).But why should you play Sekiro ? simple\, it provides a rush of thrills unlike any game From Software have created thanks to the reworked combat that is almost like a rhythm game as timing the parries is key and knowing when to attack is important also.Sekiro also contains a large variety of bosses with their own unique movesets and hazards to avoid and every victory I had was always satisfying giving me a feeling I hadn't felt since finishing the Soulsborne games for the first time moments like Making a God Tier build in Demon's Souls\, Defeating Ornstein and Smough for the first time on 0 Estus\, Getting the DLC crowns in Dark Souls II\, The moment everything gets Tilted in Bloodborne\, And the first time fighting Soul Of Cinder as a fan of the series. Moments like this will stay with me and Sekiro has plenty of moments like that if not topping those experiences at times.Sekiro is not without it's faults though a good example being how overpowered the \""Shinobi Firecrackers\"" are as I believe most if not all bosses have a flinch effect when the player uses these. Tools like the Sabimaru or the Folded Umbrella feel borderline underpowered with very limited uses in fact I only used the Purple Folded Umbrella on NG+ to make short work of the Shichimen Warrior boss who's projectiles can be easily countered with this tool.Also some bosses are straight up bad like The Divine Dragon and The Mist Noble who are basically just obstacles in the way of the player similar to something like Allant in Demon's Souls or The Congregation in Dark Souls II.Ultimately though Sekiro is a masterpiece of immesurable scale and should be something in your game library before the end of this generation and I hope we can get some expansion to the lore of Ashina and the characters that inhabit it although a Bloodborne 2 would be nice before that.… Expand"

Sekiro is a beautiful adventure game that draws you into a world that you are dying(!) to explore. It's without a doubt their most fantastic looking game to date (though purely as a matter of taste I preferred the dark grittiness of Bloodborne)\, and the fact that Sekiro can use his grappel hook to travel vertically too makes it an entirely different adventure than its \""predecessors\"".First\, some good stuffThe game is gorgeous. It's a breath of fresh air from the darkness of Dark Souls and Bloodborne\, and it's inspiring to see the team being able to put their creativity to work in a very different direction. In the past\, I've found the Dark Souls storytelling variant to be a bit too difficult to decipher\, Bloodborne had a great story that required dedication and research\, and Sekiro follows that up with an even more spelled out story\, still with lots of room for interpretation. The enemy design is varied\, ranging from clumsy swordsmen to magical creatures you want to stop and simply observe for their awesome look and moves\, practically screaming for you to research their lore. The sneak mechanics may not offer a whole lot new to gaming in general\, but it's still incredibly satisfying to successfully backstab an enemy\, especially since some of them can be incredibly difficult if you fight them in a normal way. I like this approach of even the toughest enemies being open to a crushing backstab if that's your style. The fighting style is action-filled and very different from earlier From games\, but that also brings me to the more negative points.It's hard to speak of these games without mentioning difficulty. Getting to the end of Sekiro is\, of course\, a challenge\, to say the least. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has repeatedly stated that they try to make the games \""tough\, but fair\""\, a description that fits the previous titles. And indeed\, balancing the feeling of being challenging without being too hard to be fun is not an easy task\, and one that most game developers simply sidestep by making their games easy by default or adding difficulty levels.Sekiro doesn't quite find that balance in the way its predecessors did\, and there are several reasons for this.1) No From Software games have ever had an \""easy mode\""\, but they have still had ways to make the most challenging bosses doable\, by letting you invite other players\, summoning NPC's or simply grinding a few levels to power up your character. Sekiro doesn't let you do any of these things. If you're stuck\, you're stuck. For a casual player like me\, it would sometimes mean getting stuck on the same boss for weeks\, which is too long for me.2) DS and Bloodborne allowed for different playing styles\, letting you personalize your character in a way that fits how you want to play. Your particular style may make some bosses more difficult\, and others easier. Sekiro wants you to play one way\, and if you're not up for it... you're going to be frustrated. You better get used to timing your parrying down to milliseconds and learning each and every move of 30-40 bosses. I'll gladly admit this is not my playing style\, and I find even regular enemies so frustratingly difficult to beat that I avoid battle whenever I can. The boss fights are... well... just not fun. That's my best way to describe it. They're too difficult to be enjoyed\, and there's also my next point...3) Fights are LONG. I'm currently fighting the last boss of the game\, and without spoiling much\, I can say it's of course a multi-phase boss. The first two phases are not too difficult\, but MAN do they drag out. You can easily spend 20 minutes reaching the third phase\, and you'll feel the difficulty being cranked up to ridiculous amounts. So\, basically\, that's the phase that kills you. Which is all fine and dandy\, except that you have to go through those long\, tedious first phases EVERY time you try again. This is just an example of something that happens repeatedly throughout the game. Fights go on forever\, and then you die from one simple mistake.Learning new skills and prosthetic tools are fun to watch\, but only a few of them make any actual significance in battle. In the end\, no matter how many skill points you've gathered during your adventures\, your ability to time your parries is what determines the outcome. I'm sure some players love that\, but... I don't. I found several boss battles to be a chore more than an enjoyment.My advice is... try it. I still loved it\, despite my frustrations with the difficulty for my particular playing style. They didn't hit the difficulty balance perfectly in Sekiro in my opinion\, but that doesn't take away the fact that it's still a beautifully made game with an interesting story\, great overall design and mostly satisfying mechanics… Expand"

Unlike FromSoftware's previous franchises Dark Souls and Bloodborne\, Sekiro takes a more direct approach to storytelling. Rather than creating your own character the player controls a nameless shinobi sworn to protect his master\, a young prince of Ashina\, armed (no pun intended) with a katana and an increasing arsenal of tools attached to a prosthetic arm. The story is carried by conversations between the characters rather than picking up scattered pieces of lore from item descriptions and vague references. Although Sekiro still manages to leave the more obscure mysteries for the player to solve on his own - or at least look it up later on a YouTube channel dedicated to FromSoftware lore.Sekiro's gameplay consists of equal parts sneaking around\, ambushing enemies and epic sword fights. Nearly all enemies in the game can only be defeated by a shinobi deathblow\, an instant kill ability that triggers once the player fills the enemy's stagger bar by landing blows and deflecting attacks in swift succession. Sekiro also introduces a vertical element to the combat where the correct answer to certain situations is to jump above the enemy attacks rather than simply dodging out of the way. More importantly\, it relies very heavily on mastering the deflection mechanic similiar to parrying in the Soulsborne games. A last second block of your katana awards you with an opening to go on the offensive as well as building up a significant amount of stagger. Once the mechanics click for the player the combat turns into a fast\, satisfying clash of swords where the shortest path to victory is perfecting the correct set of inputs required to stagger your foe. Additionally the player has access to a variety of upgradeable tools and consumable items that offer unique interactions with different types of enemies from shattering shields with an axe to scaring the hell out of beasts with firecrackers. Especially when dealing with the more challenging enemies like bosses you are almost expected to find a weakness to exploit for an easier victory.Much to the dismay of the more casual players (and certain professional game critics) Sekiro doesn't only not have a difficulty settings\, it also removes the option to grind for experience and overlevel the game's content by not having character attributes. On the other end of the spectrum\, however\, the news are much better: Sekiro has not one but two different ways to increase the challenge (and rewards) even further.While Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice lacks the sheer build variety of Dark Souls\, mastering the almost rock-paper-scissors like combat is much\, much more satisfying than ever before in a Soulsborne game. Even though Bloodborne holds a special place in my heart as the greatest FromSoftware game made so far\, I might consider Sekiro its equal.… Expand"

It's a very difficult change to get used to\, but once you get the hang of it\, it becomes very rewarding. However; Sekiro is the first time that I felt that From Software pushed the envelope too far in terms of difficulty. There are a number of bosses in this game that can feel completely ridiculous to the point where it's no longer fun and becomes impossibly hard. The game also has a bad habit at times of surrounding a mini-boss with tough enemies that are hard to isolate and ends ups feeling difficult because you're facing multiple foes in a combat system designed for one-on-one combat. The game's punishment for dying can be too severe\, which is taking away half of your XP and money. Unlike the Souls games\, you cannot go back to where you died to regain your loses and are instead at the mercy of the 'Unseen Aid' system which has a 30% chance of taking away the death penalty. This percentage goes down after repeat deaths unless you use a certain consumable item.This sounds like a massive flaw\, which at times it is\, but the core gameplay and exploration is sublime. When you finally start to 'get' Sekiro\, the game becomes incredibly fun and even when you're stuck on a tricky boss you usually have multiple areas to explore. Thankfully\, this is well worth your time as exploration is rewarded with items that will make your gameplay experience much smoother. Now more than ever\, exploration is rewarding and essential.The stealth system is great too. The game throws you a bone and most mini-bosses can be made much easier by sneaking in a stealth blow\, taking away a significant amount of health. This turns some battles into a bit of a puzzle. The challenge becomes finding a way to take out any enemies in sight and finding a safe sneaking path to the boss. When you pull this off it gives you the true feeling of being a shinobi.Sekiro has some of the most ridiculous brick walls you will ever hit in a game\, but when you force yourself to learn the game and its intricacies\, it becomes massively rewarding. It also has great replay value since 'new game plus' allows you to shoot for different endings and easily speed-run the game and rush to the best parts.… Expand"

Merecidamente conquistou o Game of The Year assim como conquistou os corações da grande maioria das pessoas que jogaram.Todos devem jogar Sekiro\, e eu o considero os 230 reais mais bem gastos da minha vida\, os 230 reais que me apresentaram à série Soulsborne.… Expand"

85350,Sekiro,2020-06-23,9,"Sekiro has probably the best game play mechanics I've come across in 30 years when it comes to pure dueling mechanics. Upon mastery and execution it is clearly peak action game play\, Fromsoft has never produced anything mechanically better.I would love to give the game a 10/10 but unfortunately it has flaws\, flaws that take you out of the fun and moment to moment action.Boss dueling is a true gem and boss collision works great! But I think boss grabs have frustratingly huge hitboxes\, so. It's rather annoying that many bosses have grab and throws that have movement tracking.  So if a boss dives or jumps and throws something\, you dodge right\, the dive or thing tracks right with you. Just annoying.But the real design flaws I think is the moment to moment game play. Many of the world enemies further in are not the most thing to fight\, rather annoying if anything. Aggroing anything more then 1 enemy becomes a real chore to deal with. The game is clearly built around 1 v 1 encounters.Also in my personal opinion much like all triple A games they try to create \""depth\"" by creating options\, such as firecrackers\, Kunai and several others. They can be very clumsy to use and create dozens of options as every item has like 3-5 versions creating super cluster. Honestly I would of preferred if only the option between Kunai + 2 other key choices would exist\, the rest coming from special techniques from \""leveling\"".In summary\, challenging with some of the best boss fights and dueling in games. But suffers from AAA bloat and does not excel in anything that isn't one v one boss duel\, often leading to frustrating game design.… Expand"

The weapons are beautifully crafted & fun. Don’t be fooled by some players complaining about lack of variety; this game has plenty\, as long as you’re willing to accept some changes. Sekiro wants you to forget what you know & embody Buddha; embrace simplicity. You have one sword & plenty of tools. Experimenting with them early game will help tremendously in the later game.  From skills\, prosthetics and combat arts\, you can create seemingly endless variations of combos and develop a personal style that suits you. Each and every boss has a weakness that is extremely exploitable\, with many also requiring patience. The movement is beautiful\, the world is engaging and the Sengoku era wrapped in Japanese folklore is both aesthetically and culturally interesting. Sekiro manages to pull of something risky; removing levelling\, weaponry/armour found throughout the world & asks the player to embrace a certain degree of simplicity from an aesthetic standpoint. The result is a clean & tight game. Thus\, this game effectively clears the clutter of the previous games\, trimming the fat and giving us the best parts of Souls. In short\, Sekiro embodies the best of the best from previous titles and delivers the goods in a lovely & truly beautiful experience. The variety feels endless\, the story is interesting & the characters are well written. The only reason I didn’t give it a 10\, is simply because no game is perfect.… Expand"

This isn't something I can say for the sequels\, Bloodborne\, Demon's SoulsWhen I first played Dark Souls\, it took me a while to figure it out - to 'git gud\,' if you will. I was immediately enamored by its atmosphere and by the cathartic joy of overcoming its brutal yet fair (mostly) difficulty. Playing Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is much like how I felt playing Dark Souls for the first time. This isn't something I can say for the sequels\, Bloodborne\, Demon's Souls (which I played after Dark Souls)\, or any other 'Soulslike' game out there. All of those games play\, in some way or another\, like how Dark Souls plays. Sekiro\, with a few exceptions\, does not play like a 'Soulslike.' While this was somewhat daunting\, it was just as rewarding as it was to discover how to survive in Dark Souls when I played it for the first time about 8 years ago.Even with the incorporation of super direct tutorial prompts\, getting into the rhythm and maneuverability of Sekiro's control scheme is a challenge in it's own right - especially if you're accustomed to the Soulsborne games. Also\, if you're like me\, you sort of glaze over wordy instructions and just go with the gist of it. I probably missed some key details that I later learned on my own through trial and error\, but\, even so\, this process was very rewarding. Having certain mechanics click in my head\, developing strategies on how to approach enemies or bosses\, making split second decisions that could mean life or death -- incredible.I like the skill tree system they have - it's pretty concise and to the point. Kills give you experience points that increase a blue bar in the upper right of the HUD. Each time that blue bar is filled\, you get a Skill Point which can be applied to any number of skills - including special attacks\, counters\, abilities\, and item effectiveness/quantity. Getting every skill takes a long time - as some skills cost multiple Skill Points and - as you progress the trees - Skill Points cost more experience to earn. Deviating from From Soft's Soulsborne titles\, dying only takes away half of your experience currently in the Skill Point bar (but you don't lose Skill Points themselves).Dying also makes you lose half your sen\, which is the game's currency. I was iffy with the idea of having both experience and currency separate (since in the Soulsborne franchise Souls/Blood Echoes were both experience and currency) but they do a good job balancing it out.My first playthrough was incredible. Subsequent playthroughs\, while still a blast\, suffer in a similar light to how most of From Soft’s games do - in that you sort of just rush past a good deal of the world to get to checkpoints or bosses. Having played through Sekiro a few times\, I can confidently say it’s the shortest From Software game I’ve played. This could be due to the huge amount of freedom you have in controlling your character; there’s no stamina bar\, so you can dash\, dodge\, attack\, jump\, and grapple everywhere to your heart’s content. There are also significant skips that are really easy to pull off\, but even without those it’s a game that a moderately skilled player could beat in about an hour. In its own way\, this is still a good deal of fun\, but I’m a From addict and I want more.I can’t wait for DLC… God\, I hope there’s DLC.Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is damn near perfect\, and even with what flaws there are\, its greatness is so damn great\, it supersedes the bad.… Expand"

However there's a very good reason why FromSoft specifically stated that Sekiro is unrelated to previous titles\, and that reason is why there are so many negative reviews of this game right now: The combat is even more different than it seems at face value. Meaning SoulsBorne fans are picking up the game\, being familiar with everything and feeling right at home\, then playing the completely wrong way and getting frustrated. That's also why the game has so many tutorial pop-ups even hours into the game\, to introduce every new mechanic in detail\, but if you skim read these then you will miss out on critical information which makes the game no more difficult than DS3 or BB.There is no parry in this game\, it's called deflect and it's a different mechanic. In the DS titles you had to choose between blocking and parrying\, it was a risk\, but in Sekiro you can deflect while blocking by pulsing the button in rhythm to your opponent's attacks. This makes blocking more important than it was in any SoulsBorne game including Demon's. Moreover\, because the posture bar for your block/deflect replaces the stamina meter\, your ability to dodge and run is not hindered by how much you block.In other words\, you can pressure with R1 while blocking all damage (as long as you don't try to attack when you should be blocking or vice versa)\, while at the same time deflecting\, while also being able to run away forever at any time. The Perilous Attacks\, the big red letter attacks that some people are complaining about\, are perilous specifically because they are attacks that can't be blocked/deflected and have to be dealt with using your other options\, which is why they are very obvious and telegraphed.Well\, FromSoft tried to warn us. Sekiro has all of the design elements that made Dark Souls great\, it just presents them in different ways. Aside from all that\, the level design is top tier as it is in every FromSoft game. Exploration is a joy. I also think this game is noteworthy for a reason that no one else is talking about. Team Ninja tried to make a Soulslike game with Nioh.

Somewhere around hour four of the castle boss\, I questioned whether or not I actually enjoyed this game or if I was just too stubborn to stop playing. what everybody loves about the souls games is the satisfying combat\, the exploration and staff building\, and the impressive creature design on major bosses. None of that is present in this game. Most of the bosses are small stature and built entirely around a parry system\, which renders the one form of weapon upgrades in this game (prosthetic arm) pretty useless since as long as you are timing your blocks and aggressively attacking back correctly you never have to do anything except l1 and r1 the entire fight. aside from that it's just about spending hours upon hours dying to the same boss over and over again as you memorize which attacks are to be parried and which are to be jumped etc. and then not even feeling true satisfaction because almost immediately after that\, you'll venture forth and encounter a boring mini boss that can also beat the ever-living crap out of you. And because all character upgrades are locked behind major boss victories\, there's very little to no point in grinding experience because that doesn't power your character up it just gives you passive or active abilities in your talent trees\, but none of which are particularly ultra-powerful in the first place. There's also an unseen side effect to removing armor upgrades\, weapon upgrades\, weapon augments\, stat building etc. Exploration in this game just doesn't carry the same fun factor of the other from software games. You can only pick up so many ceramic shards(rocks in dark souls)before you just stop getting excited about exploring. Other than shards or healing overtime items\, the only thing you pick up is arm crafting material which doesn't matter because you never have to use the arm for the most part\, or spirit buffs that do things like increase posture stamina or increase attack power but none of which buff you significantly much.. so there's just no real excitement in exploring. None of the rewards are very exciting for the quests. There's no covenants there's no armor there's no super secret ultimate box or weapons there's just spirit augments and crafting material and rocks. I love uncovering new area but knowing that there was never going to be anything really cool was a huge disappointment. Overall... Not their best game. It's still most definitely a from software game so it is always worth playing through\, but it lacks so much in comparison to their others\, and the difficulty being tied to timing blocks renders combat almost entirely irrelevant aside from hitting l1 to block at the right time which creates someone of a boring and repetitive experience. I looked forward to new bosses in the other games. unless I just dreaded them because they're not large in stature\, they're not very impressive\, they're just different forms of humanoids that launch an all-out assault of attacks against you that you have to hit l1 the right time a couple dozen or so times to beat… Expand"

Blocking\, while it works\, is much less effective than parrying\, LIKE AN ACTION GAME WOULD DO. This is an action game. not an rpg. You get permanent damage buffs when you beat main bosses\, so don't worry about dying. Your healing flasks are permanant so don't worry about dying. Your skill points and money  that level up skill trees can be grinded back in 5 minutes SO THERE IS NO REAL PENALTY FOR DYING. you know why? BECAUSE IT'S AN ACTION GAME. LIKE NINJA GAIDEN.

A young Shinobi named Seikro is tasked by his foster father to protect a young boy who serves as an integral part of the story.  The game introduces a new gameplay mechanic unlike any that has been done by the souls series or bloodborne. If you play the game like those games then you will have a hard time completing the game. Whatever those game taught should be best forgotten because in this game enemies here will frustrate you hard and their attacks are stronger since this game does not have an upgrade in defense mechanic.  The gameplay mechanic relies on attacking and deflection with those two on hand will help you win the battle easily and should be timed fast to counter your enemies. Your main character has a great speed movement with unlimited stamina which can be an advantage. People who will play the game as souls games must understand that your main focus is vitality and postures not stamina. Use prosthetics equipment overcome enemies and you will best bosses using those techniques.… Expand

I felt the swordplay so keenly once I got into rhythm and improved on deflecting and posture damage. When I finally understood the gameplay\, I began to enjoy the world more. Sekiro and the people he interacts with hold a lot of meaning. You genuinely care about them. I haven't felt that way for a long time\, which was back in demon souls and in ds1 .The world is not only beautiful but detailed and interactive. Sooo many ways to explore as a shinobi. Crawling under spaces or soaring through the air by grappling. I love how much it feels like you're an actual shinobi. Especially when you have so many arm upgrades to choose from too. The best thing is you can literally beat any boss without them but they're still there if you want to fight a certain way. Customizing your playstyle is very appealing. My favorite was the umbrella and mist feathers since I resort to being defensive to contain my panic moments. Music was ok. I probably only liked about 5 tracks and so that's a little disappointing for me because I care very much about the ost of every souls game. And I only didn't like the fact that they reused a lot of bosses and areas. Wish I could have explored more places and fight some more different bosses. Ptsd of a certain giant ape... Solid game. Loved it very very much. Close second to my favorite souls game which is still BloodBorne. Although I'd pick sekiro gameplay over any other souls game. And this is coming from someone who initially hated it. I'd give it 8.5/10 but since I can only pick whole numbers it'll be a 9 on metacritic.… Expand"

The parrying works for once\, and the posture system gives a whole new depth to the fights. We also have an extended set of sub-weapons that can be used to design different strategies and create new combos. It takes a while to get used to the combat system\, but it gets a little better once you get familiar with the gadgets and confident with your parrying and reflexes. Buffs can help\, but they rarely make up for the player's lack of skills.The only problem is that the learning curve is steep and relentless\, especially with the main bosses. Each boss has an entirely different moveset that needs to be learned and practiced from scratch. In other words\, you are doomed to get defeated dozens of times and practice different strategies for hours\, all to kill a single boss. It's a game for people who are willing to waste most of their free time into it. I usually get bored fast and give up with this kind of stuff\, but somehow \""Sekiro\"" managed to keep my motivation high. Maybe it's because battles are quick and enjoyable regardless of their outcome. The last couple of bosses might have been the only ones that really brought me close to destroying the disc.It's a pity that there are no \""normal\"" difficulty settings\, as a slightly lower level of challenge would make this a much more accessible and recognized game. It definitely has the potential to set a new standard for action games.On a side note\, the stealth dynamics are a bit too primitive for an eighth-generation game. It's all about backstab deathblows\, and the enemies are also deaf to the point that they don't even notice people dying a meter away or things being dropped around them. I won't complain as the game is already too difficult\, but I was expecting more depth in that sense as we impersonate a shinobi.… Expand"

The game requires you to brush yourself off\, get back up\, and try again with the knowledge you just gained.  I prefer games that respect my intelligence and ability\, while making available all the tools and hints I need to piece together a strategy to overcome a difficult situation.  Sekiro does exactly that.I've spent approximately 30 hours or so in the game and have achieved one of several endings.  I'm already looking forward to jumping back in for a second run to find everything I may have missed the first time around.  Since this is not a full-fledged RPG like previous titles\, customization is not at as high\, which may hurt replay value some. However\, it still provides excellent enemy variation\, skill trees\, and prosthetic tool upgrades to spice things up.  The story is much more defined.  The world and level design is incredible\, as you'd expect from From Software.Ultimately\, it's an incredible game.

However once I realised I was playing the game wrong it started to really grow on me quite quickly. Many people critiquing this game mainly base their argument around the games combat\, saying it's linear and and not free in how you want attack an enemy\, whilst this is true to an extent\, this is mainly because the game is not meant to be played like Dark Souls\, you are a shinobi your greatest weapon is stealth\, and the game really hones this aspect yet it doesn't force you to be stealthy (you'll probably start being stealthy when you die a lot) but it is rarely ever necessary.Sekiro is a linear game\, not in the sense that you'd think. If this is your first playthrough the game should be linear\, there is not much direction unless you do the route provided and you'll probably do that on your first run as it can be quite confusing\, in one area there are a bunch of overpowered enemies but in the other area you don't know where to go\, this all comes down to a lack of information so when playing for a second\, third or even fourth time the world is really your oyster.As aforementioned many people seemingly dislike the combat in this game however I really enjoy it\,  almost as much as Bloodborne\, its very fluid and intense\, just few mistakes could end your life after a perfect run. Even though many say it is repetitive and linear there are a lot of skills to be unlocked: that should be unlocked\, to make the experience more thrilling and more catered towards your style of  combat. If you expect to only struggle with the bosses in this game\, you're wrong\, despite being perfectly capable of running through most enemies\, I actually struggled more with some enemy sections of the game then bosses. This is mainly because bosses require skill and groups of enemies require patience and awareness.Everything else about this game is arguably brilliant\, ts unique graphics and setting is a nice change\, giving a new light to everything helping to exaggerate darker areas. The sound design is fantastic giving life to the era at which the game is set and helping to add tension and emotion where without the sound and music it would be lacking.

It took the challenge to a whole new level beyond Souls and Bloodborne\, and I’m never one to back down.The environment is beautiful. It’s inspired\, and comprehensive\, much like any souls game\, but perhaps most similar in its’ singular theme to Bloodborne. What I mean by that is most of the areas do look to be of the same world\, unlike the stunningly different areas of dark souls\, but within that\, the vistas are highly varied with rooftops\, castles\, plains\, jungles\, caves\, etc. Each new view is perhaps more beautiful than the last.While you never get a different primary sword to play with\, you have plenty of abilities and arm attachment to vary up the combat and overall play experience. These can either be very useful or entirely useless depending on how you choose to play the game. I found it most fun to take full advantage of these abilities and learn to use them as needed as an extension of my base options. This kept the combat more interesting.The combat in the game is very polished\, and actually very diverse\, if you let it be. You can truly play most fights many different ways and they are all viable. You can play with a lot of vertical movement and jumps\, or with only ground movement and heavy on parries\, or you can play the fast shinobi\, running around your enemy at high speed landing slices as you pass their flank at high speed. I think the latter can be highly fun\, but also very dangerous\, and works best when you have high confidence in an encounter and have really learned the enemy moveset. The point is you can fight many different ways and they all work\, and that’s awesome.Now about the combat difficulty.. well it’s hard. Very hard. And it’s different. Just because you are good at Souls does not mean you will have anything close to resembling an easy go at this game. The main issue with the combat is\, it can be broken. There are ways to attack enemies with highly aggressive approaches that I think break the intended flow of combat on most bosses. With that said\, just don’t look up guides. I did not get any guide help and found the fights to be absolutely thrilling. One boss took me 8 hours to beat\, and I regret none of it. I got to the point where I knew every move and how to address each one in sequence when to dodge when to parry when to use certain abilities\, it became a complicated dance. It was an absolutely thrilling challenge that I’ve never had to quite that extent in any other game.This  combat comes with a downside due to the game’s design. Some bosses have a sort of “final form” once you’ve beaten them that you have to contend with. The issue is\, if you best them in a proper fashion\, it is a long\, difficult process\, and then out of nowhere there is a whole new moveset. Learning their previous moveset took hours\, and even if you come in to the final form with full health never taking a hit\, they can dispose of you nearly instantaneously. That is when the game\, for me\, goes from thrillingly difficult\, to stiflingly difficult. It’s a mechanic that was present in DS and BB\, an enrage form\, but those games were much more forgiving\, and so you could push through it without as much effort.If you take the easy way out and find combat guides\, the combat becomes easier\, but also very one-dimensional. You don’t quite cheese the encounters\, but you certainly limit their scope\, and it doesn’t feel like the way the fight was meant to be encountered. I’d suggest trying each fight on your own\, it’s a much better experience.The lesser\, non-boss enemies can likewise be extremely difficult\, with certain levels having chains of enemies that are absolutely brutal. The variance among enemies\, however\, is lacking compared to DS and BB\, with most feeling quite similar being almost all humans. It’s my biggest letdown.Finally\, there are enemies which require a certain consumable in order to be hit. This consumable can only be dropped from certain enemies and at very low rates. This is similar to other consumable requirements in other games\, but it just goes too far here. It is ridiculously tedious to farm and the end result is you farm for an hour to get a few minutes of fighting in which.. just sucks when it takes so long to properly learn boss fights. It’s my understanding they have done some rebalancing to fix this\, though I cannot comment on this as I have not played since the patch.All in all\, it’s an amazing game\, and worth the money and then some. It’s not perfect\, and it’s  not quite the best experience FromSoftware has to offer\, but it is beautiful\, mostly well designed\, and enjoyable\, if you enjoy a challenge that is.… Expand"

Coming in as a massive Souls fan\, the combat takes A LOT of getting used to... but when it clicks it feels great. Apart from the combat though\, the exploration elements make a Souls-fan feel quite at home and as with all From Soft games it is DRIPPING with atmosphere.As with all these games I like to take my time and 'live' the experience\, so after pumping about 50 hours in I have now reached the endgame area and feel like I have a proper understanding of the mechanics and the narrative. The story is great\, with a few little twists and turns which take it into some very dark areas (both figuratively and literally). The story is conveyed in a far more matter-of-fact way than the Souls games but there is still a lot of environmental storytelling and lore to research... ie the things going on in Fountainhead Palace are not explicitly explained but having researched a bit further\, is both interesting and disturbing.Difficulty-wise\, I find the areas themselves a bit easier than that faced in the Dark Souls and Bloodborne games (probably due to the heavily utilised stealth mechanics) but the boss fights (where the player is unable to use stealth) are significantly tougher. I would place Owl Father above all other bosses faced in Soulsborne and apparently Sword Saint Ishin (whom I am yet to face) is even tougher. It literally took me 8 hours and 20 minutes of getting my *** kicked (and around 50 deaths) until I finally prevailed... not looking forward to Ishin! There are also more bosses than other From Soft games due to there being 'mini'-bosses too.There are four different endings\, two of which will probably require some research to ensure that each obscure step is completed at the right time in order to achieve each. So replayability is definitely there too. The only thing I would say is it can be a little too tough for some people with a few of my friends struggling to beat an early mini-boss that is WAY before the actual first boss AND WAY easier. That aside though\, I cant wait for the DLC.… Expand"

I would put 10/10 on this game if it wasn't two things. Last boss is ultimately hard\, which is much harder than anything you do in DS or Bloodborne or even every single one in Sekiro before last one. I never killed last boss\, but anyway I am feeling rewarding from playing rest of the game. For everyone afraid about parry mechanic. If you are DS veteran and you can manage to play them\, don't worry. I have killed every single mini boss and lore boss up to last one\, and every single one of them has some bug\, which can lead to win. You just need to master exploits if you cant master parry. But believe me\, this game deserve to be exploited :). Something else which I didn't like is that there is no any character progression. Only progression is passive hp increase and attack power increase after bosses. This is bad\, because if in DS/Bloodborne you could always level up and grind few levels before boss\, to make it easier\, here you have no choice... boss is designed for the level which you are and more or less you can't skip it (few times \, you may choose one boss before another\, but nothing else). This make your character progress pointless\, because bosses progress with you. Anyway in the end of the day\, the game is really interesting and few times it challenged me to learn and to become better in order to complete challenges. And one last thing. Parry is the most unrewarding mechanic versus bosses. Except if you don't parry him perfectly\, it is much more unrewarding than soulsborne. It often neither give you time to counter attack boss and if boss is not damaged it even don't add too much to his posture. For me posture of boss\, should be permanently decreased by successful parry\, or at least to give some reward even while boss is on full health.… Expand"

85440,Sekiro,2020-05-03,9,"I played this game so many hours in the last 3 days and i'm going for my fist review now.As a Dark Souls and Bloodborne-player I thought: Ok\, this one will be though but I already have beaten the other FromSoftware-titles so i will be fine. I was so wrong. This game is so far the most difficult one. At least till now. I needed around 10-15 hours to fully understand everything new in this game. At least I can say after after all the learning (and of course dying) the combat is mostly awesome! Blocking in time with the sword to get through the enemy's defence is so much fun! Sekiro also looks so damn beautiful (at least for me who is interested in Japanese culture and history). Exploring the world is also cool.The one thing I don't like so far is\, you can easily get one or two shot by some enemy's. Don't get me wrong it's ok that they are strong but sometimes you cant block in time after dodging them.There is another point which give me trouble so far: Dodging unblockable moves. I really love the mechanic. and it works quiet well vs. the \""zombie-coach\"" but in fights against tough enemy's or bosses it's so hard to guess for which move they are going for. The time-gap is so damn little that i get hit by nearly every attack of those.Hopefully it's just me (and not the game) who needs to improve and get better\, that i can give this game 10/10 points.-Edit-So far\, so good I think i did (and beat) everything possible in this game exept the final endboss (Ishiin).I indeed got better in this game after beating the first 2\, 3 bosses i also got (at least a bit) better in dodging unblockable moves. I also realized the umbrella-tool helps a lot when it comes to this.The fast two-shotting was still a problem for me but i got used to it.So these problems got solved\, unfortunately other things still bothered me.The first thing is the enemy-variety. It looks like From Software got really lazy at least when it comes to the minibosses in the game. It is really sad to see some of them multiple times in the game on non-special places... It's ok to face some big Samurais (they may belong to a noble-guard or something) but for the others it's really sad. I only count 2 unique minibosses (O Rin and the armored knight on the bridge).Second: The manifestation-enemys (or minibosses if you want). They are by far the worst thing in the whole game. 5 Headless and 3 Shishimen-warriors. NONE of them was not even nearly fun to fight! During the midgame i try to face them sometimes but I got killed instantly. So i faced them in lategame with full attackpower and health and they die very easy with no special tactics just hit them without pause with your \""divined-konfetti-katana\"". I expected more from FromSoftware\, than this ****At last i will come to the main-bosses in game. Also in this category they were a bit lazy. The most of them are really great in design\, super-difficult and interesting like it should be. But some of them also got reused later in game like the Monk (for which i was really glad\, the true monk was one of the best fights in the game)\, the headless ape (still creepy but kinda boring to fight in the second time) and also genichiro (which was too predictable).Talk about Genichiro\, it's really hard to push myself to fight him in the end. Why? Because of 4 damn phases..... I immediately got annoyed after beat Phase one when I saw another 3 Phase-Points. Like I said before it's totally Ok when they are strong but i don't wanna fight one guy for 20 minutes! I'm a patiently person but also my patience is limited. I prefer one or two healthbars with a difficult moveset over this guy.So sadly I can't get higher than 8 points but let me tell you it was a really great and fun experience so far which is totally worth playing. But compared to Dark Souls it has not that high replay-potential i think.… Expand"

While the graphics aren't perfect\, or as clean as other 2019 titles\, I've never considered graphics to be the determining factor in making a game. Honestly the best part of this game for me is the lore. While I love the demands of the combat system\, and I will address complaints about that in a moment\, and how it has a low entry point in the beginning but ramps up nicely lately\, the lore knocks it out of the park for me. With every boss beaten and new area unlocked the world get more and more pleasantly weird.I'm seeing people complain about the combat system\, there's no combat or play-style variety\, you can't build your character how you want\, so on and so forth. Apparently these players didn't get that far into the fighting style trees or arts. Just because Sekiro doesn't let you cheese the game with over leveled health bars and wearing the highest poise armor in the game doesn't mean its bad. The game has immense variety in both how you approach enemies and the various tools you use to sway the fight one way or another. Also QTE? I don't see one single QTE in the game\, this is seriously confusing.Ultimately the game is probably the most welcoming From Soft title to come out in a very long time. The game starts out simple yet the further you progress into the game the more options you have for handling mobs and bosses. The game demands mastery of a variety of skills rather than just being alright at one thing\, and punishes you when cannot attempt to rise to the challenge. There's a lot to be learned in this game\, and the more you learn and master the more you can enjoy the nuance of the system. Also one last thing\, if you go into combat playing re-actively you will be crushed by later bosses.

There is only one thing I enjoy more about the Souls game over Sekiro\, the variable worlds you explore in Dark Souls are among the best in video games.  Sekiro has less variety in terms of land scape\, but man is the gameplay superior in every way.Sekiro manages to have one of the best progressions in any game I've played.  Defeating each boss teaches you new mechanics in the game and familiarizes you with how the combat works.  Each boss is a step up from the last all the way up until the end of the game.Let's talk about the combat\, how has no other game had a posture style combat system before?  This seems like it should be the standard for a sword fighting game.  Sekiro gives you three options when it comes to killing enemies\, stealth\, vitality hits on person\, and building up posture by supplying a lot of blows that aren't direct hits and parrying at the right time to stagger your enemy for a death blow.  This posture system is so good I am shocked no games done it before (at least as far as I'm aware).  There are really 8 key parts to combat besides the three ways to kill\, there is blocking / parrying slashes / parying thrusts / attacking / jump kicking / prosthetic use / deflecting lightning back at the opponent / and dodging grabs and other unparryable / blockable moves.  Each enemy gives you a split second to decide which of these 8 things you want to do at any given time\, some bosses have combos that can combo with any other one of their combos allowing for near infinite combability.  This means some bosses require to learn every individual combo and be able to identify which combo is coming up on the fly because bosses could use 2 or 3 combos directly in a row.  This kind of fast play makes it feel too good when you pull it off and makes you want to master it to do so.In FromSoft fashion we also have plenty of secret areas to explore and numerous bosses / minibosses that are optional.

But at the end it was dropped to the bottom as much as it possible in my eyes...  I play with Isshin Ashina in the end and I really really wanna the hell out of those developers and creators. It's insane to play that battle with incorrect hit-boxes\, 4 (!!!) phases of boss fight (including Genetiro Ashina\, because he's fighting in one of phases that also have incorrect hitboxes when lower attack is going and double jump probably shall not work)\, 3 phases with the final boss and he's fighting with 3 (!!!) different weapons. Ask to the developers. HOW YOU IMAGINE THAT WHEN BOSS INSTANTLY SWITCHING THREE TYPE OF WEPONS WHEN HE'S JUST SWORD MASTER??? It's ridiculous. But it's not the main problem. With incorrect hit-boxes and at least a couple of missed attacks he's just killing you :). When you passed 2 phases well it goes to the hell. I'VE LEARNED HOW TO PLAY WELL BECAUSE I'VE NOT MISSED ALL THE DEATH ATTACKS. But when he don't stop to pushing you it looks really insane consider there is GREAT difference between first two phases. And he attacks with three types of weapons. And in the last phase there are four types of weapons (including lightning strike) + and many of melee attacks combining guns. Hell out that game. Repair god damn incorrect hitboxes!!! Don't you really see that's broken? In confirmation of my words just google that 'YouTube 8t4Qw9R1DnM'.

In fact\, I find these mini bosses to be so overwhelming that I instantly look online for a strategy. I've never felt so little about cheesing a game as I have for Sekiro\, because Sekiro is just too much! These mini bosses are brutally unfair - spamming with damn near unavoidable moves. Each time I see one my heart sinks as I anticipate the coming war with this damn thing.From software makes technically poor games. Their design and premise is good\, but they're rife with technical flaws that have been with us since Demon's Souls and really should have been fixed by now. Input lag\, bad lock-on\, superfluous loading\, attacks through walls\, poor AI pathing\, misleading conversation prompts\, bad inventory management and so on. The point is\, that if the design and balance isn't good then the game comes out very poor.It's all about balance. Whilst not a souls game\, Sekiro clearly uses a modified version of the same engine behind bloodborne and DS3\, and as such retains a lot of \""soulsborne\"" feel whilst dropping a lot of the RPG mechanics of prior games - leaving the combat as the main focus of the game. This leaves you with only one way to \""do\"" things - the way from intended - if you try your own strategy against a boss then you're just going to be punished. You have to deflect this guy or counter that guy\, but you cannot dodge or run around as they have moves to punish that. So the entire game ends up being a parry fest\, and you eat death after death until you find out the pattern for this boss and then do it all over again half an hour later.Excuse me for finding this infuriating.… Expand"

I can't give it anything past a 6 simply because it's.... well\, mediocre (for FromSoft). As much as I wanted to fall in love with this game I have to admit that Bloodborne is better in almost every way. The story was extremely predictable though I won't explain exactly why b/c I don't want to spoil it for you. It's basically the equivalent of mario trying to save/protect the princess. The game just didn't captivate me... like at all. I never had a sense of wonder and excitement or FEAR in seeing what's next like I did with BB. The fear is artificial. It's \""oh great\, another tedious battle\"". I remember when people were speculating that the game would have a crazy horror twist and that got me excited\, unfortunately the game has none of this. Only 1 enemy in the whole game was a little creepy. The combat\, while fun for a while\, becomes boring. You're given ONE play style for the entire game. You get prosthetic tools but\, honestly... you DON'T REALLY USE THEM. Parrying is what you'll be doing 99% of the time. I almost never used prosthetics or items the entire game.As far as the difficulty goes\, a lot of it just comes from learning how to block/parry and timing. If you suck at reflexes this game you will struggle. But you WILL get better (if you want to progress). In fact I found the game to be in general EASIER than BB or DS. The ONLY area that is harder are certain bosses which took me more tries than some BB or DS bosses. Regular enemies and mini-bosses become trivial once you learn how to parry\, block and respond to perilous attacks. There were a lot of poorly designed bosses... really glaring ways to cheese but also repetitive in nature. You will fight the same type of \""boss\"" multiple times throughout the game. Also\, Mini-bosses get in the way of the suspense and build up to a big boss. A lot of times you fight a mini-boss RIGHT BEFORE a big boss. But it just feels like 2 boss fights in a row. And all the bosses have a lot of health\, which just FEELS tedious\, but again... the game really isn't that hard\, just reflex-intensive. So you will be doing constant parrying and attacking along with quicktime-like events for perilous attacks.Sekiro overall feels uninspired. Like it was lacking the soul that DS and BB have. Part of the reason for this is they reused so many elements from BB and DS that nothing seemed new. The only new aspect was the combat. Many enemies and locations are direct re-skins of previous enemies/locations in other FromSoft games. The story reuses certain plot-lines and styles.What bugs me the most is that very little is \""memorable\"". The NPCs and their quests\, the boss fights\, the locations\, or the atmosphere. It's all just mediocre\, feels too safe. And I hate saying this b/c the game is automatically better than most games\, b/c it is a FromSoft game afterall. But don't we want something that will blow us away like Bloodborne? BB was a perfect example of how to keep the Dark Souls formula but mix it up with genius storytelling and exciting gameplay in a new dark/mysterious universe. Unfortunately\, Sekiro just doesn't match this \""leap\"" as well.OK so what do I think they could have done to improve this? Allow us to loot weapons/armor. Add more RPG elements. Give us the ability to change how or character looks\, what they wear. Adding multiplayer or something chalice dungeons to help replay-ability. Give us REAL reason to use prosthetics and weapon arts. The weapon arts and prosthetics are rarely used aside from early on in the game on rare enemies. Create a story that is more subtle/interesting/creative/unique. Make the story darker\, more gritty; improve the atmosphere. That said\, i don't think it's awful. It's still better than a TON of games out there. But it really doesn't meet the quality that Bloodborne put out there. And that's the big problem in a nutshell.… Expand"

I've gotten part of the way through it and decided to sell it without finishing. I'm all for difficult games that present a challenge and are rewarding\, but the difficulty of Sekiro is just wasted. The bosses have too much health\, take too little damage\, and can wipe the player with a chained attack. If the combat and game mechanics were better then grinding through overpowered bosses wouldn't be so annoying. But the player goes straight from mounted samurai at Ashina Outskirts to Brazen Bull to Seven Spear guy guarding an empty temple to other samurai guarding Ashina Gate with riflemen. There's no breathing room between them and little satisfaction in beating them because the combat is unfulfilling. The story to the point which I progressed was fairly empty and the characters totally flat. That would be fine if the rest of the game were good.

With Dark Souls you could usually clear out the areas once to find all the loot and then - if you die - run to the boss in less than a minute.

To engage these mini bosses - who at least in the beginning are very strong compared to you (I haven't progressed very far) - you need to first clear out the entire area of normal enemies\, or you'll soon find yourself against a mob and a mini boss. This means 5-10 minutes of meticulous sneaking and clearing out the area so you can try again. And die. And then do the same thing again. It's rather frustrating.In Souls games\, you could level up to get stronger and try again. No such mechanism here. You can only level up through prayer beads that you get by killing mini bosses.

That combat\, along with said stealth and quick vertical world traversal was quite enjoyable and a nice change of pace.  Overall I really enjoyed the game\, but not quite as much as the others.  It took me quite a while to complete\, but kinda for the wrong reasons.  Having to fight some bosses over and over and over (and over) again in order to progress at some points became more tiring than rewarding for some of the fights.  I certainly don't want easy mode\, but this particular game of From's seems to be much more trial and error than adapting mid-fight and overcoming.  With deflecting\, dodging\, blocking\, attacking\, and jumping there is just too much to negotiate with some of these bosses until you memorize the patterns.  Then you need to execute it near flawlessly to achieve victory. Now do that 3 or 4 times per boss with more movesets\, higher aggression\, lightning\, poison\, projectiles\, fear\, and/or fire tacked on each time.  It can be very rewarding\, but it can be very tedious and almost unfun.  A bit of both\, I guess.  The system works well\, it just feels like too much system sometimes. And that is AFTER it all clicks. The size of the game area-wise is not that big\, and areas are repeated with different enemies after triggering certain events.  This was not a big issue\, but a few more areas would've been nice.  The one thing I missed most was the risk/reward of pushing on at the expense of souls to get further. The \""bonfires\"" are pretty close here and you just straight-up lose half experience upon death.  It works\, but the stakes just aren't as high in that department.  Story was fine\, but I do prefer the cryptic style of Souls. Overall I loved it and appreciate From doing something a bit different.… Expand"

The aesthetic and the setting of this game drew me to it so i decided to give a shot.Unfortunately\, i lost interest in the game after about 15 hours. It felt like the game boiled down to simply memorizing attack patterns for bosses. Once you understand the parry system and that almost ANYTHING can be parried no matter the size of enemy. Trash mobs become a joke. Bosses mostly felt like a chore. If you're like me and have a very limited amount of time to play video games\, you will likely not want to spend hours on a single boss and then you will cheese the encounter just to repeat the pattern. Due to the extreme difficulty though\, it felt pretty good to beat the bosses.The progression doesn't feel worth it. You get some new attacks\, but your mostly good with your first spinning attack combat art that you unlock. Many skills are just passives that make you deal more posture damage or the ability to carry more spirit emblems. It just doesn't feel worth it. Don't get me wrong\, they're super useful\, it's just boring. Of the skills you do get that alter the way you play\, only mikiri counter and chasing slice. Honestly I am tired to death of the sound effect for executions without even completing the game.The threat of losing XP and money wasn't even tangible when I played\, since you can just farm an area until you get a skill point\, buy stuff for your hard earned money and then carry on without losing anything if you die. And there's the supposed \""punishment\"" for dying which will lower your unseen aid. You will never have a use for unseen aid even if you keep your dragon rot at bay.The prosthetic tools are fun\, but the \""loaded\"" upgrades you get are simply not useful because you will very rarely get the breathing room to use them. The game also tells you very little about what uses many of the tools have and you will simply have to  try them out while you die over and over. Some prosthetic tools do massive posture damage to bosses when you have the right upgrade\, but good luck finding out how to do it. I'm amazed by how some players first though of some of the things\, it's just convoluted.The different areas are varying\, but the level design is not impressive. It is extremely linear with some verticality and often there are not many more ways to approach a situation than head on.Story wise\, it is pretty amazing\, which makes me sad to abandon it.

85512,Sekiro,2019-08-02,5,"Sekiro is great in terms of graphics\, animation\, world design and atmosphere. It makes you want to keep playing more. What ruins it for me is gameplay mechanics and pacing. What happens is there is some short stealth gameplay before each boss. Then there is a boss- miniboss\, which you will lose to(for sure) x times before you learn how he moves.You can basically lose to the boss as fast as seconds. Then u have to replay the stealth level to get to the boss. So it turns out to be like: Stealth (fun for the first couple of times\, tedious after)\, boss- die x times in a matter of secs- repeat the process x times until you learn move set of the boss. That happens every 5-15 mins.There are points where you have to fight like 4-5 bosses/minibosses in a row (ashina castle). So final feeling is as if I am playing super meat boy where I fail to time botton press correctly\,die\, repeat for gazillion times until you do it. It is basically a boss fight game.Even if I really want to play\, I can't after some point\, as I know that every time I'll be playing the same boss over and over again until I meet the next one after a few minutes. You can easily get stuck for days in each of these bosses\, and lose like 30-40 times easily.Fights are not fun as they usually end in a matter of seconds. You learn through endless repetition\, instead of long epic fights.Fights are based on timing\, and give no 2nd chances if you miss.Game is nearly unplayable for casual players.Game is completely unplayable for chilled players. You have to be on edge through the whole fight\, to time every block and recognize each move.For souls fans\, it is like there is a nameless king level fight\, every 5 minutes.So even if I really wanted to like the game\, it drives me away because when I turn on the ps4\, I know that possibly tonight I' ll be playing a boss fight 30-40 times and then quit. Or maybe I win this one fast\, but the next boss is after....2 mins!!! And then another!! I prefer to have fun with games. I don't have the need to prove to myself sth over masochistic repetition. Sekiro is coated in an atmospheric / immersing design\, but plays out like super meat boy eventually\, having an arcade like feeling at the end\, where every atmospheric element is dispelled after you lose 5 times to the same boss (again saying this happens every 5-15 mins at best).So to close\, pace is interrupted very very frequently by boss fights (ultimately a boss fight game)\, which require accurate flawless timing or endless repetition to overcome. Not my kind of fun\, sorry.… Expand"

It looks\, moves and plays like a Soulsborne game\, but lacks in every single departments when stacked against its superior brethren.Combat focuses on deflection more thanFirst things' first - do not let anyone fool you - Sekiro is a mechanically streamlined Soulsborne game\, with unforgiving difficulty. That's not inherently a bad thing; it just so happens that in this case - it is. It looks\, moves and plays like a Soulsborne game\, but lacks in every single departments when stacked against its superior brethren.Combat focuses on deflection more than even Bloodborne did\, and where Posture used to diminish a Stamina bar that also managed strikes and running\, Posture is now the only game in town. This means that managing your own Posture is extremely easy\, whilst breaking the enemy's is extremely effective\, significantly diminishing threats to your person if you are prepared. That\, in turn\, removes a lot of the excitement of meeting new foes - they will rarely surprise you\, and often\, their dull moveset will only vary in timing.Structurally\, Sekiro does a lot less than Soulsborne games. By removing the outrageous fantasy settings of its older\, wiser siblings\, Sekiro is now a game of very few visual themes - everything is a goddamn Pagoda in a forest\, be it dark\, well lit\, partially underwater or covered in Sakura blossom. It's all the same design. Gone are the fantastic sprawls\, the magnificent views\, the disjointed hellscapes - it's all Pagodas\, making exploration dull and uninspiring. What's jarring is that this is still a fantasy game\, but with barely a smidgen of imagination and complex design of other Soulsborne games. 90% of the time\, you are in or on a pagoda. 75% of the enemies are a human with a sword. All caves are caves\, all ravines are ravines - maybe toss in a Buddha statue to give it some diversity. In Sekiro there is nothing quite imaginative\, twisted or whimsical - like Dark Souls 2's fixation on castles and knights were somewhat overbearing\, Sekiro crushes overbearing by cranking up pagodas\, bland ravines and samurais to 11.What Sekiro lacks in twisted dark and macabre level design\, it tries to make up with Spider-Man style swinging. Given how clunky movement is in these games\, it's surprisingly functional\, and makes traversal a breeze... but is that a good thing? I remember how\, when the truly fantastic Enslaved: Odyssey to the West came out\, it was panned for the climbing sections being on-rails and sticky\, unlike other games with climbing mechanics at the time (Uncharted\, Tomb Raider etc.)\, removing a sense of urgency and risk. I think this critique applies equally to Sekiro - traversal is no longer a challenge\, no longer engaging the player\, with hook points popping up on the HUD to prompt a button press to zoom out to the next area. It does give a sense of verticality\, but that does not make for good or challenging level design. Players just zoom around until the next action segment without a second thought to their unimpactful environment\, which played such a massive role in previous games.There isn't much to say about steath. It often feels like cheating by how much easier it makes certain segments\, but is another point to make towards calling Sekiro a Soulsborne game - the AI is so absurdly Soulsborne by how awful and plain it is in its very core\, that stealth segments are a bit of a joke\, and simply a mechanic that does not work.Finally - the paper thin plot is again\, that of breaking immortality. I don't mind hearing this story told over and over in Soulsborne games\, where the world is rich and the details are oozing from everything - but the more Sekiro tries to tell its bland story\, the more it becomes a cringy\, lightweight retread.And finally - the bosses and minibosses in Sekiro are just awful. Prepare to fight each mini-boss three times or more\, and some major bosses\, too. Huge life bars make for annoying\, boring trial-and-error driven combat that provides no breaks to players. Combine that with a lack of flexibility\, lack of leveling-up\, lack of robust abilities\, lack of multiplayer\, and that leaves you with simply beating these highly specific and incredibly boring skill-checks that are there to prevent you from breezing through the easy main game by challenging you to memorize their moveset\, rather than improvise\, adapt and beat them by using raw skill\, luck\, overall preparedness or a well-rounded character. If you do not rehearse Sekiro's battles\, you will fail - full stop. That's not fun\, that's just repetition.I ended up beating Sekiro twice\, and enjoying my second playthrough more once I got over all that disappointment. It is not a particularly bad game. But it looks\, plays and has the same pedigree as truly great games\, which is why Sekiro being so medicore in every single aspect brings such shame upon it. Am I angry Sekiro is \""Not a Soulsborne game\""? No - I would love to see From try their hand at other games. But Sekiro IS a Soulsborne game - a bland\, uneven\, uninspired\, unimaginative\, slightly boring\, frustrating\, repetitive and downgraded Soulsborne game with an automatic hookshot. And that just sucks.… Expand"

Please people\, heed my warning. This game is NOT what you are expecting if you are a fan of FromSoftware's previous famous titles. I cannot believe the sheer volume of perfect 10s this game is recieving. Over-zealous fanboys/girls are really doing a disservice to this company by blindly praising this game. Yes the gameplay is quite different to souls\, but in a really bad\, unfair\, not fun way (unless you belong to the small population of super-elite gamers who have no other life and spend all waking hours playing this and poo pooing everyone else)I gave this a three only because I really did like the beautiful environments\, sound effects and music. The option to have the dialogue in Japanese with subtitles also adds to the experience. Unfortunately for me and many others\, this is where the positives end.Having soloed all the other souls/borne games and many other souls-like games from other developers and loving them\, I was excited to say the least when this was announced. The way it was advertised made it look like a souls game set in medieval Japan with added gameplay mechanics (grappling hook\, jumping\, limited on-the-spot death revival\, etc.) and sped up combat. This couldn't be any further from the truth. In reality this game is far closer to Ninja Gaiden or fighting games due to the reflex-based combat but far harder and not fun. Let me explain.The combat is so unbelievably fast and twitch-reflex based that is it just obnoxious. Playing this like a souls game will get you killed in seconds and that's fine\, it's not Dark Souls\, BUT\, even playing this game as it was intended requires either unaturally high level of reflex or literally life-consuming levels of practice to build up super fine tuned muscle memory. Strategising\, carefulness and character building have been thrown out the window. Most people who have an actual life do not want to spend their free time playing a game that requires weeks or months of slogging to grasp the basics. The previous FromSoftware games did require learning and implemented a steep learning curve but even still\, were more forgiving than this. They also offered large amounts of variety and reward for overcoming that curve which leads me to my next point.Sekiro's offers absolutely no gameplay variety\, particularly for bosses. You are stuck with one main\, unalterable weapon and NO armor options for the whole game. Sure there are prosthetics\, but they are few and far between and largely not necessary. More importantly there is no variation in play style. You have to rely almost solely on deflecting (parrying) and countering. For bosses you have to learn when exactly to hit the deflect button\, the dodge button\, the jump button\, or the attack button. Failure to do so EXACTLY as the devs intended results in death. In this way I felt like I was playing guitar hero but where one wrong button-push resulted in a complete start over. I was locked into a precise pattern of unfairly fast reflex button pushing. These decisions have to be made in… Expand"

85485,Sekiro,2019-03-29,7,"Pre-release promotion material and official change of genre somehow enwrapped me into believing that Sekiro might indeed be something different from Souls series. Thankfully it was an illusion: like predecessors\, Sekiro is all about combat and exploration. Though not in classical ratio.The genre is ‘action-adventure’ now but there are some important remnants of RPGs. ‘Souls’ are nowPre-release promotion material and official change of genre somehow enwrapped me into believing that Sekiro might indeed be something different from Souls series. Thankfully it was an illusion: like predecessors\, Sekiro is all about combat and exploration. Though not in classical ratio.The genre is ‘action-adventure’ now but there are some important remnants of RPGs. ‘Souls’ are now experience and money. Half of the both exp and money is irreversibly lost upon death. Exp goes into skill points needed to buy abilities: passive\, conditional and active. Money is needed to trade and to upgrade prosthetic arm. Prosthetic arm is fitted with multiple tools that have numerous upgrades costing  randomly dropped materials\, so we can label prosthetic arm as a loose imitation of equipment progression. Character development simplified into two stats: vitalily\, upgradeable by Prayer Beads found in the world\, and attack power\, increased upon defeating bosses. The last part is ‘healing gourd’ aka estus flask\, serving and upgradeable in absolutely same manner as in DS2 and DS3. As you can see\, aside from lacking of character builds\, Sekiro is as RPG as DSs were RPGs (can DSs be called RPGs is another question)\, especially given the fact that Sekiro is still about that “think up the story yourself”\, weird oddities and hidden pseudo quests.The problem is that the journey of taciturn shinobi Wolf in service of young lord Kuro\, whose blood can bestow immortality\, is plainly *less* that of any soulsborne game. It comes from two objective factors. First\, and more crucial one\, is limitation of the setting. It is totally understandable but still regrettable that feudal Japan\, XVI age\, cannot provide the same grandiose and contrast locations that purely fictional world can. I mean\, typical Japanese castle filled with typical japanese houses? Snowy mountains leading to them? Grass fields? Sakuras? Too *plain*\, especially compared to DS1. The only two locations that surprised me were Sunken Valley and Ashina Depths. And not because it was something unseen before\, but because it was unexpected. The second factor is above mention lack of material gain in exploration. Prayer beads\, gourd seeds\, 8-9 tools and occasional story item is comprehensive list of worth finds. How much shorter is it compared to predecessors? (Well\, note for the new players - it’s still better than countless generic text/audio logs or coins/vases/masks/ships/cups/...\, which is somehow predominant gameplay device nowadays). But still\, the world is seamless\, big and beautiful\, all in good old traditions. The ability to fall from high heights and hook oneself to distant cliffs is breathtaking. From Software was afraid to fail vertical level design but they managed it well. So is it worth exploring? Yes. Is it good? Yes. Is it the best? Not at all.Now for the funny part: combat.  Let’s lay bare few bitter truths first: combat arts are useless\, prosthetic tools are useless\, stealth is a joke. By useless I mean low percentage of useful tools/arts\, and complete unnecessity to use them. Stealth is helpful (especially as a first strike to mini-bosses) but secondary: if they removed it\, no one would have noticed. It all comes down to deflections. You and your opponent have posture bars that is filled upon taking damage\, guarding (blocking) or when your opponent timely guard your attack aka deflect. When enemy’s bar fills up shinobi is allowed to execute deathblow which instantly decacipate opponent (bosses requires several deathblows). When shinobi’s bar fills up he is stunned briefly.  You still have your dodges but they will do you much less good than in DSs. Well\, actually dodges is essential part of hit’n’run tactics to kill things (which is\, by the way\, the only path to success on higher difficulties) but my point is that deflections are the bliss. Miyazaki stated his intention was to capture the feel of \""swords clashing\"" and it’s right here\, just as he said. You attack and you deflect. Yes\, it’s reflexes\, yes\, it’s QTE\, like many player already drew comparison\, but damn it’s beautiful. The feel is here and it's awesome. The mobility of Sekiro is awesome too. The great three (attack\, deflect\, dodge) creates a real martial flow.And yet we cannot toss this sad fact about Sekiro aside: most of the bosses are a reflex trainers. There are no strategic approaches\, no use of head brains (unless you’re a hit'n’runner). From Software clearly intended to create a “difficult” game and wasn’t really creative about it. Some bosses are pumped with ridiculously high amount of posture/health and design of some of the others is outrightly horrible (hello\, Long-arm Centipede Giraffe). The percent of useless mechanics in the game is unbecoming.Sekiro is “git gud” game. Exploration is still fun but locked behind reflex combat. Don’t try to be a Shadow unless it is exactly what you are looking for.… Expand"

I'm almost 40 hours in and at the end stretch of the game. Every time I played\, I hoped for it to click\, thinking that it may be something wrong with me. The glowing critic reviews left and right didn't help either. To summarize what I think is wrong with the game\, it's the overall interaction of it's (stealth / combat) mechanics that encourages you to play in a very specific way.For example\, a large percentage of the minibosses have entourages that are designed such that the safest / most rewarding way to go about those engagements is to:1) Stealth kill a minion2) Run out of aggro range3) Wait a minute for remaining enemies to disengage4) Repeat 1 to 3 until you can fight the miniboss individuallyimmersion issues aside\, doing the above can take up to 15 minutes per \""run\""and if you die - which always will happen because you have no idea what the new boss' moveset is\, you have to repeat the process all over again. The major bosses are also designed to be impossible to defeat the first time through because you have no idea what the exact timing is for all their strikes and combos and this meant you can never reliably parry their attacks which is also the singular way to win.The whole game is akin to doing tiresome dance rehearsals repeatedly until you get a waltz down the way your instructor wants it to be\, except he doesn't tell you what he wants in the first place and you have to be beaten into knowing. This wasn't a problem with Dark Souls because caution could always bring you far and there were plenty of alternative solutions to the same puzzle.By the end\, Sekiro felt easier and more manageable when I could play by it's set of rules but that's because it forced me to play the only way it wanted to be played and the lack of player agency left a bad taste in my mouth.My conclusion at the end is this - Sekiro was overdesigned and has an identity issue. It wants to be a little bit of Tenchu\, but doesn't do it well. It also wants to somewhat be Dark Souls\, but doesn't do that well either. It definitely wants to be Onimusha / Bushido Blade but is also halfhearted about that. I have little doubt that Sekiro will not be looked upon favorably years after the hype has gone.

They're great games but they're by no means flawless. Meanwhile Sekiro and DS II are barely floating over an 8 on userscores so clearly there's a significant number of people that disagree with the critic scores. Gonna be honest\, I'm not a reviewer so don't expect me to give some amazing review just enjoy the thoughts of a Soulsborne fan that was severely disappointed with Sekiro.Anyways\, the game itself is fine. The combat can be fun and enjoyable but for a game that's supposed to not be a Souls game it is too similar to a Souls game without retaining the same things that make a Souls game fun. To name a few of the removed things weapon and armor variety as well as being able to create any kind of character you want. Instead you're given a singular weapon and what is more or less just a normal Souls item in the form of the Shinobi Arm.  At the very least the first couple are just a throwing knife and the Souls kick that breaks the guard of enemies using a shield. The axe is more permanent as it actually breaks the shield but it still does the same job of breaking their guard and opening them up to a Riposte/Deathblow which are basically the same thing as they typically kill the enemy using the shield unless they're special in some way.The same Bonfire/Enemy Respawn mechanic is back again and you still have an Estus Flask albeit with a different name. The only real difference here is the grappling hook and ability to jump and crouch. Some would say Stealth as well but you can stealth Souls games to some degree and I wouldn't exactly call Sekiro that different. Sure it works great sometimes but sometimes the enemies are just placed in a way that you can't just stealth the area much like normal Soulsborne.The last and biggest complaint I have here is ironically about the same thing that From is known for doing well which are the bosses in the game. Soulsborne bosses have always been somewhat grand encounters which stand out significantly from the rest of the gameplay. In Sekiro\, they've literally just been normal people that just don't die and can kill you in 2 hits regardless. I was honestly questioning if what I was calling bosses were even bosses as they're just laid out in the level like normal enemies just with multiple health bars so your instakill move doesn't instakill them. They're not especially memorable either and of the first 6 I know at least 2 are basically identical samurais with big katanas. The difficulty is all over the place but an average person has basically no chance of legitimately beating a boss without a lot of deaths which is only further dampened by the fact that the game penalizes you for dying too much. As for what that penalty does exactly\, I don't know. I got tired of the game and quit playing after around 6 bosses so I never found out. Not that it really mattered to me anyways as I didn't care about the characters in the game as they're not especially interesting.I honestly wish I could say the game was better but it's just not that great. It's not a bad game exactly but it's basically crippled in my eyes due to its standing as a From Software game much like DS II. I'd honestly recommend Nioh over it as Nioh at least has a lot of combat and enemy variety.… Expand"

If not\, I'd advise a rental first.Bear in mind - particularly you knee-jerk \""git gud\"" apologists - I am a HUGE From Software fanatic. I've played everything since Demon's Souls (including DLCs) to completion. I *like* difficult games. But let's put a little more thought intoTedious. Plodding. Punishing. Arbitrary. If any of these descriptors get you excited to drop $60\, go for it. If not\, I'd advise a rental first.Bear in mind - particularly you knee-jerk \""git gud\"" apologists - I am a HUGE From Software fanatic. I've played everything since Demon's Souls (including DLCs) to completion. I *like* difficult games. But let's put a little more thought into this - difficulty is not the only measure of a game's quality.To be fair\, we were all aware that this wouldn't be a Soulsborne sequel. But its being a From game\, I remained optimistic. What's been delivered falls short of expectations. First criticism: it's extremely one-note. It's a parry/riposte game at its core\, and that's about all it is. If you don't dig that one mechanic... well\, you do now\, because it's what you WILL be doing for the next 60 hours or however long it takes. Oh by the way\, frame rate is a little dodgy on PS4\, so this timing-intensive mechanic will be routinely undermined by... um\, timing. There's also a stealth component for those of you who like crouching in grass and moving very slowly.From's siren song of \""hard but FAIR\"" cannot be sung for this game. Fans may tell you otherwise\, but the game is frequently arbitrary\, and never in your favor. E.g. In the middle of a boss battle\, if you stray a few feet too far\, the boss might lose interest in you for a moment\, and magically regain all of his health and \""deathblow\"" points. (I'm not talking about posture\, which enemies regain as a matter of course when you're not engaged.) Your own health and resurrection points? Yeah\, not so much. tl;dr - the game cheats. It's already hard as nails; it really needn't cheat.Finally\, there just isn't enough variety here to make it worthwhile. I happily endured all of From's previous games because\, in between the steep challenges\, there was such a thrill in unfolding the world and all the RPG systems. Well\, this isn't an RPG\, and in absence of RPG incentives\, the world feels kind of empty. You flit about with your grappling hook - novel at first\, but eventually this undermines any sense of structure or mystery. Skill trees offer some interesting upgrades\, but also a lot of obvious filler. (\""Ooh instead of carrying 15 of these items\, I can now carry *16*.\"" I am not making this up. Minimum amount of flair.)  The boss to non-boss ratio is much\, much higher than in Soulsborne\, or in fact any game I've ever played (excepting Shadow of the Colossus\, which was famously all-bosses.) If you enjoyed the exploration and slow burn of Soulsborne as much as (or like me\, more than) the boss battles\, then Sekiro is going to bore you to tears. Graphics are a mixed bag. The writing and voice acting are quite dull.In summary: not feeling it. Except for the tendinitis\, arthritis\, etc.… Expand"

I am not such a fan\, so I grant it a 7. Generously.Sekiro looks gorgeous\, that much is true. It just lacks free roam content that is there for viewing only. Everything is functional\, sadly\, so you don't get to just look in awe.However\, gameplay-wise it feels like a DS game turned to 11. As if the designer listened to the fans chanting \""hardcore\, so hard\, so fun\, so elite\, truly Dark Souls is the Dark Souls of gaming\""\, shrugged and said \""well\, if that is the only thing you care about...\"" and then just pushed every other concern aside.Despite what was promised early on\, the \""Shinobi\"" part is pretty bleak. Stealth and subterfuge are not really Wolf's strong suit and most enemies are placed in such ways that killing them stealthily takes time and doesn't pay extra. Skipping entire groups of enemies means depriving yourself of experience\, money and items. Besides that\, many grapple points are placed just far enough apart that you won't be able to spiderman your way through\, forcing you to crouch and creep around between grappling\, breaking any tempo you might have had.Then there's the combat. It comes with a major problem - normal enemies are fast\, come in groups and have no friendly fire whatsoever. You let go of the block button once and take a flaming arrow to the face\, said arrow coming straight through three or four enemies. Annoying\, isn't it? Also\, nothing staggers\, unlike you. So you can take an axe to the face with no warning or prior parry\, just because the enemy decided to swing it and there's nothing you could do. Parry is the name of the game but it doesn't add depth\, just width. You can only git gud mechanically\, but not strategically\, sadly.The worst offender is the camera. While it's nice of the developers to try and help the player ever so slightly\, the target lock and camera reset are on the same button and target lock has a mind of its own and shifts around if you try to move the camera because... you guessed it. \""Switch target\"" is on the same four buttons as \""rotate camera\"". There's a setting for targeting aid when not locked on\, but the game doesn't seem to aid me even slightly - without target lock enemies just sidestep while Wolf keeps moving forward even if I rotate the camera mid-combo.And while I am all for understanding that Sekiro is not a slasher like DmC V\, I can't help noticing that Wolf moves so fast and jumps so high his physics are much more fit for an arcade rather than a \""hardcore\"" swordfighting game.… Expand"

But that aside my biggest problem with the game is that when you get to a boss/miniboss you want to clear all the enemies around the boss first before engaging the boss and of course you're probably going to die a few times before beating the boss. So this means you're going to have to go through getting rid of the trash enemies around the boss over and over again which is tedious. In my opinion they should've left the other enemies separate from the boss battles like dark souls does. The other thing is that when you get to a boss/mini boss if you want to do the smart thing and do a stealth hit on it first to take half the health away you often have to go face the boss to wake it up basically then run away\, wait for it to chill out\, then sneak back to the boss and do a stealth hit. I think this is stupid because once again when you're facing bosses that you are probably going to die a few times before defeating you have to repeat this technique over and over. In dark souls there is no gimmick like that so it worked. You could run past all the weak enemies and enter the boss and the smoke wall would keep the other enemies out. It's just you and the boss and no repetitive busy work before you face it. Other than this problem it's a good game but not as good as any of the dark souls in my opinion.

The frantic open exploration really compliments this and is most highlighted when making a leap of faith off a ledge to grapple-hook away from a tense fight\, unsure as to whether you'll make it.A variety of endings gives longevity but nothing next to the experience of character builds and customisation that adds to a more traditional Soulsborne experience.

Sekiro has completely broken that mold and done something innovative that provides a new challenge to new players and veterans of traditional Souls games.In fact I'd just say straight up\, there's no need to come up with a new moniker like Soulskiroborne or Soulsborniro because Sekiro doesn't really fit in that box at all. From did a great job of creating a game that appeals to it's fan base while giving them a completely new experience.One of my favorite aspects of the game is there's no cheese to be found here. In a Souls game\, if you're having difficulty with a boss you can just grind levels\, change your stat build\, change your equipment\, and come back with a completely different strategy. Sekiro strips all that away and forces you to rely solely on your own personal ability and reflexive skill. There's no cheese\, no grinding\, just sink or swim\, and while I understand how this can be off-putting to some people\, it's so much more rewarding when the flow of battle finally clicks and you come away with a victory against a boss that has been giving you trouble. You own your victories.There do seem to be occasional screen freezes in the PS4 version\, though it hasn't happened in a crucial time or during combat (so far).My only real complaint beyond that is that the streamlining of Sekiro and the lack of a stat build or equipment changes doesn't lend itself to replayability\, which is a major facet of the previous From games.

Also you can't farm souls to become overpowered becuase you get experince instead that you use to unlock cool skills to utilise in combat. But honestly? The basic sword parry and the mikiri counter will be what you will be using all the time but you can use the skills if you want to look cool and spice it up from time to time.Also yeah i know f@#$ me for being a filthy console peasant but at least optimise the framerate a little bit so i don't fall to my death.Also the stealth gameplay is awsome and very useful in a lot of situations but it's a bit... wonky. Sometime the enemies can't detect you when you're running around right under their nose\, other times they immediatly know your exact location because your a$$ hair was poking out of cover a bit.One last thing i loved about this game is the breathtaking world design!

And if you respond too early\, like after seeing the symbol but before the right time in the animation\, it can cause you to run right into the enemy's weapon.Another unreasonable thing I find about the difficulty is that some fights are more about inventory management and knowing how and when to use certain items than they are about practicing and refining your skill. There is a mechanic called \""Terror\"" which builds up like poison or burn\, but instead of draining your health when your meter is full\, you just die no matter how much health you have. Certain enemy attacks will take a lot of your health and most of your terror meter\, so if you get hit twice and don't heal as well as sedate yourself in between\, that's game over. And if the boss uses terror attacks\, there's a good chance you'll need another special item to do a significant amount of damage to them\, and it's still going to be a tough fight. That means you'll probably have to farm items once you've died enough times.Enemy AI is pretty bad. They don't notice bodies on the floor\, and they completely forget about you once you've left their field of vision for a few seconds. This is how a lot of stealth games work\, but it feels out of place here where everything else is so difficult. I suspect they had to dumb down the AI or the game would have just been impossible. Maybe if it weren't so hard to begin with then the stealth could have been balanced better. This is all just speculation. Maybe AI just is bad because this style game is completely uncharted territory for FromSoft. There are also parts where enemies will fight each other\, which is really entertaining\, but you can wander into areas where they are standing right beside each other and haven't seen each other yet. The AI is probably the most objectively flawed thing in the game whereas other things are perhaps just sour grapes from the difficulty.Traversal is fun but also feels unpolished at times. There are areas where you're supposed to access\, and areas you're not\, and it's hard to distinguish between them other than to just realize that your double jump or ledge grab isn't working. Sometimes you can reach areas you shouldn't which leads to other problems. Other time's you can't grab ledges that seem like the perfect thing to grab. I'm being a bit fickle here but I'm just trying to get all the bad stuff out of the way.As is to be expected from this developer the level design is unparalleled. Adding stealth mechanics to such a well thought out world is a brilliant combination. There is something very rewarding about finding the optimal path to take\, and there is usually multiple ways to traverse.The storytelling is fantastic\, all the bits of lore hidden and sprinkled throughout are so rewarding to discover. FromSoft knows they are good storytellers because they have you explore and complete quests\, and reward you with items that do nothing more than unlock new dialogue from certain characters that provide a bit more insight into the story. Any other game you'd expect some weapon upgrade for your efforts\, but Sekiro pulls it off because it is so immersive and wrapped in mystery that you want information more than anything.I know I had some bad things to say about the combat\, but the posture system really is a creative approach and the timing based combat is really fun and rewarding to get good at\, though not for the faint of heart or someone without a lot of time and energy to devote. There's a lot of really cool enemies with unique fighting styles. And there's a lot of fighting styles you can learn too. Fine upgrade content with the prosthetic arm as well.Visually\, the game is breathtaking. The boss battles are so diverse and creative though i still have ptsd from some. The voice acting is really great too. This game should be an 11 out of 10 but the flaws I mentioned add up.… Expand"

The game reminds me of Nioh but nowhere close to being as fun.. Why? Because it's not as deep mechanically as Nioh\, has no gear/weapons to get throughout the game and my biggest issue of all\, it forces you to play with a certain style.If you don't force yourself into learning how to parry\, then you're not gonna have a healthy experience with the game. Dodging isn't as safe as it felt in other FromSoftware games and blocking is just a waste of time since 9/10 enemies will continue to swing their weapons relentlessly until they brake your guard. Same applies for your prosthetic tools.. There will be many times where you NEED to use them otherwise the game will screw you hard. Lastly\, stealth is pretty much mandatory for the majority of the game. It's a good addition....when it works. I can't count how many times I've died because I jumped into an enemy and the assassination mark didn't trigger.Moving into visuals and performance... Again\, not impressed. I don't pay attention to graphics much\, but I do value framerate. It's 2019\, FromSoft is a company that bathes in gold from the sales of SoulsBorne games and you're telling me they can't provide a proper fps boost on PS4 pro? The framerate is uncapped but almost never goes above 40. Reminder that GoW 2018 was a much prettier game\, with the same semi-linear structure and had a respectable 45-60fps experience.Closing this review with a personal statement.. This \""hard but fair\"" debacle needs to go away IMO. The game is as fair as a fight between me and a Sumo wrestler. When the enemy needs 25hits to take down while I die in 1-2\, is not fair\, especially in Sekiro where most of your hits end up being blocked. It's a hardcore game yes\, but not \""fair\"".Overall the game is a big meh\, doesn't do anything better than previous SoulsBorne games or Nioh and the fact that it forces you into a certain playstyle is a big turn off for me.… Expand"

85636,Sekiro,2019-04-19,4,"Sekiro is a lazy game compared to its predecessors.  I played Demons Souls\, all the Dark Souls and Bloodbourne.  Loved all of them though Bloodbourne less than the Dark Souls games.  Sekiro is a dumbed down version of Dark Souls and Bloodbourne.  No levels\, no builds and one weapon.The game is Bloodbourne's focus on aggression\, only on steroids.  If you prefer the aggression ofSekiro is a lazy game compared to its predecessors.

No levels\, no builds and one weapon.The game is Bloodbourne's focus on aggression\, only on steroids.  If you prefer the aggression of Bloodbourne to the more defensive and tactical nature of Dark Souls\, then you'll probably love Sekiro.  If you prefer Dark Souls to Bloodbourne\, this game will likely prove disappointing and annoying.The Good:The music and sound are good.  The sound effect of clanging swords is great.  The voice acting is good.  Some of the particle effects are good.  Anytime something is on fire it looks great.  Controls are mostly good with some exceptions.  World design and connectivity are good\, but not as good as past games.  Framerate is good as are the animations.The Bad:Everything is very samey.  There are not the variety of bosses that the previous games had - the ones here are generally very similar.  Encounters mostly come down to L1 parry if the posture bar builds fast\, or run around and attack during the times they are open to attack if the posture bar builds slow.  The prosthetic tools feel like they were added because the dev team realized how one dimensional the gameplay is.  Most of them are gimmicky for one specific use\, while only a few are useful in many situations. The  prosthetics do very little damage\, so they aren't a separate play style by any means.  The overall game design is very inflexible (particularly compared to other From games).  They expect the player to play within very narrow parameters.  Its a weird situation because you'll know you exactly what you are meant to do\, but you won't always be able to execute successfully for a variety of reasons.  The gameplay is very twitch based and reflex sensitive.  Some will like this\, but it makes the game harder for older players whose reflexes are slowing.The stealth feels clumsily implemented.  It's as if the devs included stealth out of a sense of obligation due to this being a ninja game\, but they didn't really want to take it very far.  The only purpose stealth really serves is to make traversing the levels slightly less annoying and in knocking one life bar off of minibosses.The worst sin of the game is that minibosses and bosses are repeated all of the time.  You will fight the same samurai and ninja minibosses god knows how many times.  You will fight repeats of most of the bosses\, not just once but many times.  You fight one boss five times.  You fight a variant of another boss 4 times.  The majority of the bosses and virtually all of the minibosses are copy/pasted later in the game.  It's a cynical\, lazy way to add content to the game and I can't believe people aren't mad about this.Graphics\, textures in particular\, are poor to mediocre.  This game has a lot of blurry textures to the point where it sometimes looks like a PS3 game.  In general\, the game lacks a sharpness in the graphics department.  The camera in this game is atrocious\, as is the lock-on system.  Get near a wall and you'll lose lock and then have to relocate the enemy.  This generally happens during minibosses and bosses.  FromSoft seems to have designed a few encounters around these failures.  One miniboss in particular is placed in a room so small that the camera and lock-on are constantly a problem.  Very cynical game design.The game is an exercise in tedium.  Almost everything about the game is tedious.  Enemy placement in levels is designed to be as annoying as possible.  Many of the minibosses are surrounded by 5-10 trash enemies that have to be cleared before each attempt on the miniboss.  Many of the bosses are not very engaging due to the one dimensional emphasis on parrying.  All of the bosses have multiple health bars.  Then some have three\, while other encounters have a 2 health bar boss and then a sidekick with a third health bar.All FromSoft games are difficult\, but this one lacks the pressure release valves that the previous entries had in the form of coop and leveling.  Increasing attributes occurs via beating bosses\, so there is no way to powerlevel if a boss proves difficult.  There is no coop to help with bosses you're stuck on.  Some will view this as a positive\, but it greatly restricts the accessibility of the game to the non-hardcore gamer.Previous FromSoft games drove me crazy\, but I felt a huge sense of accomplishment when I beat a boss.  In this game\, the bosses drove me crazy\, but there was very little sense of accomplishment upon beating one.  I mostly felt relief at moving on to something else\, almost like I finished a chore.  I am extremely disappointed with this offering.  It is not up to From's lofty standard.… Expand"

If you get better and defending\, you get punished. They speed up the patterns. You learn that\, and they give a delay in your reaction times when buttons are pressed. I thought this was all in my head. Apparently\, I'm not the only one that has figured this out.I'm severely disappointed in this one. I feel like its a giant MIDDLE finger to devoted fans. There is so much potential\, but please don't punish devoted fans. I love FS games of past because they break up the monotony of the same ol' same ol'\, but come on.The only reason I give it a 5 and not lower is because there are moments of greatness\, but they need to balance out some of the boss battles.… Expand"

Mechanic is pure joy.Enemies and bosses are hard\, but fair. Every main character death is a result of player mistake but not an unfair AI actions. The variety and amount of bosses is tremendous\, though some of them appear couple of times during playthrough.Game world is big and leveldesign on a big scale is magnificent! You can reach any point in the world that you can see and sometimes it is just fascinating to observe from a distant places you've visited half game ago.The plot is kinda simple. In oppose to SoulsBourne games deep multy-layerd LORE\, in Sekiro we have a staright forward story with very few unexpected twists and no underlying lines whatsoever. The world itself is just something I personnaly not interested in. Middle age Japan is not my thing\, so I have nothing to say about it.Visually game is ok\, but nothing out of the ordinary. There are couple of beautiful locations\, but in oppose to dark and mysterious Bloodbourne atmosphere Sekiro can't offer anything spectial.But in the first place the game is about mechanics and it works great.The thing they've left character stats and loadout out of the boat is totally ok with me. Game is much closer to slasher than to an action RPG now. Still there are quite some tricks and combat movements player can aquire during game and prosthetic arm improvements make Sekiro's arsenal even bigger.There are a lot of dispute around Sekiro's difficulty lately. The game is hard. It took me 77 hours to beat it and I had a lot of trouble with some bosses. But it's not unbeatable and it is certainly becomes quite easy once you master it. The easiest way to check how it works is get back to bosses\, that troubled you some time ago and beat them once more. It'll be super easy\, because knowing mechanics and boss movement basically everything you need to be good at. So people who ask for an easy mode\, are just lazy and refuse to learn game rules. And what's the point in playing a game if you don't want to follow the rules?… Expand"

They clone the design\, locations\, literally everything. You would not be able to distinguish the two games if they were not set in two slightly different japanese periods\, so the overall architecture is just slightly different.The only difference is that combat in Nioh is thousands of times better than this mess.However\, given the big name of From Software\, they're able to get away with it just fine. Very\, very shameful to do something like that in my opinion.The game itself has literally nothing. It's just a bad version of Bloodborne\, with even less weapons (i.e. no weapons at all)\, armors (no armors at all)\, and items (no items at all).Most likely this took like 2 weeks for From Software to develop\, they just stripped Bloodborne to the bare minimum to call it a game\, reskinned it after the success of Nioh (deserved success\, it's a masterpiece) and put it on the market.I really don't understand the high scores...don't waste your money like I did. It's a very bad game\, filled with the usual From Software bugs\, which here are even more extreme. There are countless instances of enemies standing in front of a wall doing nothing.The game is to be played stealthy\, in theory. In practice most enemies can see you through walls\, breaking your stealth.The combat\, as pointed out by many many users\, feels random at best. Forget the strategy and rewarding gameplay of Dark Souls. This is something inbetween Lord Of The Fallen and The Surge. Sometimes something happens\, you have no idea why. You acquire new skills\, they're completely useless against enemies.Nothing does any damage at all. Shuriken? No damage (in Nioh you could do a ninja build killing a boss only with shurikens). Axe? No damage (I hit a boss in the face with the axe\, no damage at all). The fire crap? No damage.Basically the shinobi arm is just a gimmick that you will soon forget about\, because it's completely useless against bosses and mini-bosses\, no item you can ever mount there will do any sort of damage.Of course there's no healing and each and every boss and miniboss will always oneshoot you\, no matter what.Deflecting simply does not work\, it requires timings so precise that it's impossible to achieve with the absurd amount of input lag the game suffers from. You have L1 pressed\, you release it\, you press R1\, the game acts as you pressed R1+L1. This is the first time ever I see this in a game.The only strategy that works for bosses and mini-bosses is to look up online what is the trick to cheese them\, because most of them are vulnerable to some sort of buggy AI behavior. You need to execute exactly the outlined movements\, always the same\, always in the same exact way. Just hitting the boss with your sword won't do any damage.Where's the fun in that? It's not even a matter of difficulty (I can go over Dark Souls 1/2/3 and Bloodborne easily)\, it's just too much repetitive. If you played Lords Of The Fallen\, you know what I mean.What a wasted opportunity.… Expand"

On the PS4 Pro the experience was good\, stable frame times\, around 40 FPS and the combat system was smooth. It was a gorgeous experience\, one of the reasons why I unlocked the platinum.But it just don’t understand how stubborn Developer have to be\, to be releasing a game\, that has 2013 visuals\, and not even vaguely polish it for running smoothly on 30 FPS on the base consoles.I am saying all this because not everyone has an enchanced console like the One X or PS4 Pro.Overall great game on PC\, PS4 Pro and one X. For the base consoles I can definitely not recommend.… Expand"

I've played all the Souls games and Bloodborne is my second favorite game of all time. Sekiro though... it doesn't hold up as well as those other titles. Some of my main gripes are as follows;- No Armor? Wow\, I can't believe I'm actually typing that\, but Sekiro has no armor/loot system. That's one of the most fun aspects of Souls games in my opinion. I loved grinding enemies for different loot/weapons. Not sure why they scrapped such a cool aspect of their games.- Guard system is pointless and broken. I just run around and poke bosses to death or find other means to cheese them because the combat is so broken. There's no poise or shields in this game. Instead FromSoft wants players to block with a little sword? What??? Most enemies will destroy your guard and instakill you if you try to block.- Dodge frames have been nerfed. The dodging in this game is terrible and has almost no invincible frames like past games. It's practically impossible to dodge boss ultimate attacks\, you'll have to pop some food buffs and just pray your vitality can tank the hit because dodging is very unsafe. This mixed in with the bad guard system makes things an all around mess.- Weak boss line up. Most bosses/ mini bosses are just dudes with swords/lances/guns. It gets pretty uninteresting half way through the game. Granted there are like 4 boss fights that are cool\, but you gotta grit through all the boring stuff to get to them.I could keep going\, but I really don't want to waste much more time on this game. Sekiro is pretty mediocre and that's unfortunate for Souls fans because now we're left waiting for the next installment to those good games. Luckily\, if you're looking for a good samurai souls game to play in the meantime\, I highly recommend checking out Nioh. It's a much better attempt at this genre than Sekiro is in my opinion and the DLC is some of the hardest/funnest stuff I've played. It also has an amazing loot system to boot.… Expand"

85711,Sekiro,2019-04-01,7,"In Sekiro\, From Software boils down the combat of Dark Souls and Bloodborne to it’s most brutal and intimate – where constant engagement with the enemy is required to succeed.  However\, much of the variety and satisfaction that is typical of From’s other Souls- like games has also be been boiled away. Partly due to the setting and theme of the game\, but I fear it is also because FromIn Sekiro\, From Software boils down the combat of Dark Souls and Bloodborne to it’s most brutal and intimate – where constant engagement with the enemy is required to succeed.  However\, much of the variety and satisfaction that is typical of From’s other Souls- like games has also be been boiled away. Partly due to the setting and theme of the game\, but I fear it is also because From Software are starting to believe their own hype.The commitment to sword fighting certainly gives Sekiro it’s own flavour and soul.  You defeat enemies through strict attacks\, parries and deflection usually when the enemy telegraphs a specific move.  ‘Hanging Back’ or Shield/Tanking will get you murdered fast. Some encounters have large arenas but ‘giving yourself room’ will only just prolong your very certain death.  Most fights require you to waltz in uncomfortably close proximity to very intimidating people – a waltz you instinctually fight against.Your agency as a player becomes limited once you are close enough to fight\, as responses need to be very specific.  This translates to reduced satisfaction – I didn’t ‘beat’ bosses so much as I responded in the required way to their actions – never really feeling like I had overcome the enemy – but was only allowed pass the area after following the enemies orders.At times it seems that the game is trying to be frustrating for the sake of its own rep (as opposed to increased satisfaction of victory).Specifically with bosses whose attack telegraphing is so subtle that it’s incredibly difficult to figure out what attack is coming in the 1 second you have to react.  You need to be very active and get toe to toe with the boss\, but you absolutely cannot trade blows either because your health bar is some sort of prank for those gullible enough to think it makes any difference to your survivability.Most boss hits will either knock off 90 percent of your entire bar\, our just outright kill you.  Any hit you survive will require 2 seconds to heal\, an action which some bosses are programmed to leap across the arena in that very moment and immediately remove that health you just got back.Sekiro bloody knows this too.  There is a resurrection mechanic whereby you resurrect where you died (sometimes resurrecting twice is possible depending on progress) to continue the fight.  Which tells me that the developers knew how cheap death could be and added the respawn mechanic after developing the main combat to help balance things.I can already hear the response that this was due to the plot thread of immortality and resurrection – but that would  work anyway from the fact that you can revive at a bonfire (called buddha ‘Idols’’) like other Souls-like games.  The resurrection mechanic feels like a development patch.Sekiro seems to be heading towards another critical point of Souls-like in the form of ‘shared knowledge’ – where much of the content is discovered through communities/wikis.  I found this to be much less appropriate in Sekiro because it is definitely a single player game – there’s no co-op or invasions. I’m also pretty sure I would still be stuck on some of the bosses now if I hadn’t looked up solutions.I thought about a time when I was playing games before I had the internet\, and if I was playing Sekiro then there would be no way I’d have figured this out.   And it’s not optional stuff either – its critical path main story progress.This is not a bad game\, in fact it  has many of the good quality for Froms other souls like.  Great areas to explore\, will designed characters and and interesting story -  But it's pushing too far in the name of its own rep.  The builds\, magic\, dodge rolling of other games is gone but not replaced with anything as substantial.  The prosthetic tools are surprizingly useless as you ultimately need to play guitar hero with each encounter.  There is no creativeness in success.

85713,Sekiro,2019-03-29,4,"Sekiro is a beautiful game with great soundtrack and sound effects. The story is scarce\, the questlines boring\, and the NPC forgettable (can't even kill them this time). There is little incentive to play this after the first run.It is ALSO let down by the combatWith each iteration\, From Software wants the player to stop doing what they are doing and \""parry\"". That was the case in Dark Souls\, where some enemies are easily taken out by properly learning this technique. Makes sense! Then in Bloodborne\, they took out the player's shield and gave it a gun for parrying enemies (you can't parry most Bosses\, but the safe distance of the gun was balanced).Then in Sekiro\, they want you to do nothing but parry / deflect. Block-spamming\, or block dancing\, for most players\, is the most boring combat engine I've seen in a recent game..Did you not deflect a flurry of attacks perfectly? Well\, you are going to eat an attack! Where you not at full health? Well\, you'll probably die. Oh\, and while you are rolling on the floor after being punished for not playing perfectly\, all that posture damage you managed to make will go away because you didn't deal any actual damage to the Boss. So\, you either play perfectly and don't press any buttons so you can press block / deflect from the barrage of attacks the Bosses do (that take at least 1/2 your life\, while you do 1/32 or even less).. or you run around waiting for that ONE hit you can make without being hit back\, lowering the Boss's vitality making your posture damage worthwhile.I'm also very disappointed with the Controls and hit-boxes.. They should not be a problem for such a company.  The lack of interesting items\, weapons and the short duration of this game is also a negative.The Unseen Aid and Dragonrot mechanic is also nothing but an annoyance. Players\, instead of risking moving forward when low in resources will now\, due to fear of the unexplained mechanic (and the probability of NPCs dying)\, return to the closes Sculptor Idol. It's fabricated length.Also\, I would have been fine with dying a lot\, but losing SKILL points and money? Because seriously.. who is going to walk around with skill or money that they wouldn't rather FARM and SPEND as needed? It doesn't really tie-in the theme of the game..And speaking of that\, this is a Shinobi or Ninja we are playing as.. but the little stealth / deathblow mechanic is relegated to common enemies.. There is NO Boss battle where anything akin to Ninja skills are required. Instead\, you fight like an honorable Samurai each time (without mentioning the \""Shinobi Execution\"" message\, that makes no sense).Finally\, Ninjas are known for strictly following the rules.. So when it comes to decide which ending you are going to pursue\, not listening to your number 1 rule is out of character. Also\, 2 immediate fights and a lazy twist where you become \""Shura\"" is one of the worse things of the game. It seems like they ran out of time or creativity.** And a personal issue : They had the Sculptor's Idol right in front of the optional Demon of Hatred Boss\, but for Genichiro + Isshin\, you have to wait for the LONG load times + go up the stairs + skip a cutscene every time. The fact that this is such a long battle\, and Isshin's Phase 2 and 3 don't give you that much time to heal when you are learning the strategy doesn't help\, and Dragonrot messages + Useless unseen aid makes repeating this process utterly annoying after a while. If you are going to make your Boss a minimum of 5 minutes (with basically 4 life-bars)\, you could at least make it easier on the casual player\, if they are to repeat this for days.Played it\, finished it\, didn't really enjoy any aspect of it and will not return to it.… Expand"

85721,Sekiro,2019-03-26,10,"At first glance the gameplay may seem extremely basic\, just one attack button and one guard button after all. But the amount of timing\, prediction\, and skill needed to succeed in battles is so much more in depth. You can't just learn boss patterns like in Dark Souls\, because timing is so much more necessary.Those that continue to try and think of this game as Dark Souls are guaranteed to fail\, because this is nothing like dark souls and there is no reason why it should be. Whats the harm in FromSoftware branching out and succeeding so wonderfully after all?If there is any issue I ever have with the game\, it stems from momentary frustration due to my own ineptitude\, and is easily remedied by me thinking back on my mistakes. Once I realize what I did wrong it is easy to remedy and try something different. Bosses like Genichiro or Lady Butterfly can't be fought defensively\, meanwhile bosses like Guardian Ape or Corrupted Monk can't be completely offensively. Yes\, both need offense and defense in specific balance\, but it becomes easy to tell simply by how the enemy moves and attacks.Simply put\, I fail to find much fault in this game overall\, it simply accommodates with so much of my preferences in games. It's skill based and fair\, but punishing if you get even slightly too cocky. The bosses all have simple ways to win\, but it takes a while to figure it out if you aren't paying attention. And the story\, oh god the story and characters are just fantastic-.Now\, I'm very nearly finished with the game (At the Isshin fight going for the Severing of Immortality ending.)

However\, this time around they have included a combat engine with a greater degree of dynamism\, allowing for intense skirmishes based on parrying\, deflecting\, and good 'ol maneuvering. Honestly\, combat is the best a FromSoftware game has ever been. It stands among the best in the entire art form. The world is rich and beautiful and well realized. The leveling system has been dramatically simplified\, but in its place is a fantastic system for developing\, and upgrading\, your shinobi prosthetic (which essentially acts as a sub-weapon). The traversal in this game is shockingly satisfying. I was not expecting that. I figured we would get something along the line of the grappling hook in the Arkham games (which I always found a little cumbersome)\, but instead the grappling hook feels fast and fluid. The traversal in this game feels like it mixes the best elements of the traditional Souls level design/progression\, with BotW's emphasis on verticality and freedom. The balance it strikes is extremely satisfying\, providing an end result that makes the traversal feel incredible\, but without undermining the tight level design. Sekiro is a marvel. It is going to be brought down by the barrier of entry (which forces people to play Sekiro in a thoughtful manner)\, as frustrated gamers are bound to lash out\, but don't pay them any mind.

The game is hard\, yes\, but it’s made harder through the new levelling system where you collect prayer beads for vitality increase and memories for attack from bosses and mini-bosses. ThatAs a long time fan of FromSoftware games I was really looking forward to this\, especially given everything that Bloodborne brought to the series which was a welcome change\, Sekiro has disappointed me. The game is hard\, yes\, but it’s made harder through the new levelling system where you collect prayer beads for vitality increase and memories for attack from bosses and mini-bosses. That means there’s no longer the ability to farm xp and develop a build to suit the players style and work to have a balance to deal with everything the game throws at you. Instead there is a skill tree\, which is pretty decent\, but without getting to invest into attack\, healthy\, stamina\, or defence\, you still have the same attack power and health until the bosses are dealt with. Rather than take chances\, there is a tendency to play with caution and not use the abilities in the same manner you would in other games. Unfortunately the enemy design is pretty bland\, meaning you will encounter the same enemies time and time again and use the same technique of block\, parry\, counter with a deathblow\, instead of relying on the skills learned.Sekiro introduces a new stealth mechanic but it’s underwhelming. Facing multiple enemies head on is sure to get you killed\, so instead you’re to watch\, wait and take enemies out silently. The problem is in the takedowns; they aren’t very stealthy and will alert nearby enemies in a second. Leaping from above will yield the same results\, and the is no option to drop down silently. Instead\, you have to pick a direction and leap forward. It’s clunky\, and feels thrown on at the end as it doesn’t differ from the DSBB drop attacks and backstabs. Obviously it’s a problem on the ground too with not being able to silently move from cover to cover of traverse objects. It’s only truly effective when moving in tall grass. Cheesing enemies is possibly but it means that you stealth one\, run and hide and repeat.I wish I could like this a lot more\, but sadly I’m not enjoying my time with it and I rarely play for more than 90 minutes and I start getting tired of it. The boss fights are different and you have to pay attention. It’s required to take some time and defend to learn the attacks and each is refreshing but the key is always parry and counter. Unfortunately after dealing with much of the enemies in the same was there is a loss of excitement when makes moments fall a bit flat; the ending fight (I think I got worst ending) is really anti-climacticI cant see myself coming back to it again. It’s a shame\, as I really wanted to like this\, but at times it felt like an effort to preserve when the same type of enemies are ahead. Yes\, people will say that if you don’t like it you’re a causal and don’t deserve the game\, but that’s not a tight argument\, and I don’t believe the game should have an easy mode. The problems with Sekiro are towards the mechanics and the game design which relies too heavily on repetition. If you enjoy this\, and like your games to be Sisyphean then you will probably get something here\, but if not\, you may find it to be an uneventful slog… Expand"

Being a true Souls-series fan (started with Demon's Souls at 2010\, now completed all of them multiple times)\, here are my first impressions of this game so far:The combat:------------------You play as shinobi augmented with an arm prosthesis. Katana is your primary weapon and your main defense. The core mechanics are simple: Attack or deflect enemies attacks to degrade your opponent's posture. Once the opponent's posture is broken you may execute an deathblow attack to deal plenty of damage. You may block or deflect enemies attacks with your katana. Beware of your timing and posture though... You also need to master techniques such as jumping\, mid-air kicking\, dodging and counter attacking to become skilled shinobi. Certain enemies needs specific strategies and skill. Arm prosthesis can be augmented with different tools to aid you in the fight. There is no stamina\, but swinging blind means dead. Despite being faster-paced and utilizing more mobility\, the combat feels natural for Souls-fans with it's familiar control scheme\, lock-on system and tight response.The stealth:------------------There is an enjoyable stealth aspect to this game. You can crouch beneath the vegetation\, hug walls and hang on edges to sneak past enemies and eavesdrop their conversations. You fling around the roofs and cliffs with your prosthesis. The game doesn't force this but gives you freedom instead. Utilizing the stealth and mobility feels natural and rewarding.Exploration:-------------So far I have discovered some cleverly hidden or well guarded items familiar to Souls-series. The fling ability adds a completely new dimension to typical Souls-esque exploration. You can loot sen (money) and items from fallen enemies. So far the areas haven't felt dull (I'm still at first area)\, but I'm hoping to see mighty pagodas and unique architectures during the journey.The world & lore------------------------Where as Soulsborne games are medieval- and Victorian-era fantasies borrowing elements from the European culture\, Sekiro is Sengoku-era fantasy borrowing elements from the Japanese culture. The characteristic \""Souls feel\"" is still very present in the mystical lore\, symbolism\, hidden events and the general look and feel of the game. I'm still at the very beginning of the journey waiting to see how they managed to balance the diversity and coherence of the world.Summary--------For Souls-series fan the first impressions of this game (after reaching Sculptor) was like returning home. On the other hand\, it feels like playing Demon's Souls for the first time back then\, thanks to fresh new elements. I will update this review once I have completed the game.… Expand"

Vertical exploration and traversal is great.

It's essentially a glorified and fancy QTE system\, with much less emphasis on precise dodging and more on mashing appropriate buttons at appropriate times (colored symbols are also flashed). The entire combat system feels like big regression from FromSoftware masterpieces in the past.

Another ridiculously hard boss here or there that I eventually overcame after immense mental fatigue. Once I got through\, the game gave me more areas to explore in its final act than what I'm used to in a Fromsoft game which was very cool. What wasn't very cool was fighting 4-5 of the sub/bosses again but either palette swapped or in greater numbers...lame. I really hate padding in my games and soulsborne games usually do a pretty good job of avoiding that..Once I worked my way to the end the hardest boss I've ever fought was in my way of seeing the credits roll. This guy killed me countless times and the game forces you to LIGHT SPOILERS fight each of its forms every time you retry. I was getting really exhausted by the end of it\, and when I finally hit the killing blow and the credits rolled I thought to myself \""Damn that was barely worth the effort\""This is a solid\, quality video game to be sure\, but it's really held back by how ridiculously difficult it is. Better telegraphed unblockable moves\, snappier inputs (sekiro sometimes just doesn't register button presses which is very irksome in a game that requires so much precision)\, a better battle camera\, and a little trimming of the fat and this game would be a strong 9. As it stands now\, I have to give it a 7.5. It just felt like the game didn't want me to enjoy it. It just wanted to dump on me at every opportunity.… Expand"

You’re going to end up with a souls-lite experience.Now. Let’s judge it for what it is:Sekiro is a brilliantly crafted\, brutally challenging\, utterly enthralling ACTION game with some ‘souls-like’ elements.Leveling up isn’t the focus here. Instead\, the real skill is put on the player in a way I haven’t experienced in a video game for quite some time. Becoming a master of your simple skill set is such a rewarding journey\, I am stunned at how meticulously crafted it is. Every experience teaches you and gradually hones your skill. None of the game can be surpassed through over-grinding or leveling up some magical weapon you saved up for. You need to listen to the NPCs\, you need to grow with the game\, you need to practice your actual gaming skill. As a result\, the entire experience is one of the most rewarding I have ever felt playing a game. When it clicks it feels so so good. You feel like a superhero.The visuals are some of the strongest I’ve seen from From Software and the world is gorgeous. The entire aesthetic of the game is slick and elegant. The story is really fantastic as well. I was impressed with how deep it was\, given how few RPG elements there were.Overall\, this is already my game of the year. It will take a great deal to knock it off it’s throne. I have played all souls games\, but I am by no means a From Software junkie or die hard fan. I expected an interesting experience with Sekiro\, but I never imagined how swept away I would be.… Expand"

I just don't get what everyone is so up in arms with it about.\n\nFor starters\, the game's story is really good\, honestly\, with a character you can really sink your time into in Sekiro. It'sNot a bad game\, just don't understand what the hype is about.Given all the hype that was surrounding this game\, I was really looking forward to it\, and in all honest I have enjoyed playing it. I just don't get what everyone is so up in arms with it about.For starters\, the game's story is really good\, honestly\, with a character you can really sink your time into in Sekiro. It's FromSoftware's first protagonist that you can actually develop with in terms of character. Sekiro is a pure bad-ass for sure. While the grappling hook is a clear steal from a well known Nintendo franchise\, it is used very well in this game in for the stealth aspect. The action overall action isn't bad either.Thank you for finally adding a freaking jump button. That may not seem like much of a concern to others\, but a jump button really helps me manuaver through a battle better than simply rolling/dodging. That's just me. Also\, I love the \""no stamina\"" gauge idea. Personally\, I always felt that games that featured a stamina gauge steered the advantage towards enemies/bosses because it always seemed like they had unlimited stamina (even if they had a gauge).So why the mediocre 7/10 score? To put it simply\, this game doesn't really add anything new to the genre for me. Let's be real\, if this wasn't a FromSoftware game\, would you even care? Let's take off the rose-colored glasses for a second.First off\, as mentioned by others\, the only main weapon in this game is a katana (and some shuriken). While it may not seem like a big deal\, it really is. It makes every battle the same. Either you stealth stab someone with your sword\, or you rush an cut them with your sword. In ancient history\, ninjas (shinobi included) used various weapons such as blowguns\, caltrops\, hook swords\, chigiriki (flail)\, kusari-gama (chained-blade)\, polearms\, and even some bows. So\, why the lack of variety in this game? Even the most basic of action games gave the player a bit of variety in order to help them decide how to approach battles. Even the 8 bit Zelda games gave you a bow and a hammer.The graphics leave a bit to be desired (especially from a 2019)\, however\, that doesn't bother me quite as much as others. As long as the game doesn't break\, I'm OK with it.Going back to combat\, it feels really weird that the game is based off of breaking enemy guard and parrying\, and yet\, there is no stamina. It sort of makes you sit back and say\, \""Well\, what't the difference?\"" because\, well\, what is the difference? Isn't that a stamina thing? Fights are more fast-paced\, but it given you essentially have to use the same patience as other FromSoftware titles\, it can make harder battles (particularly boss battles) feel like \""hurry up and wait\"" kind of strategy.Also\, for a game that is getting such praise\, I expected something...different. Pretty much every mechanic from this game has been used before in wide variety. The grappling hook\, as mentioned\, was used in the Zelda games\, the parrying/guard-break mechanic was used in many games including previous FromSoftware titles\, the cinematic death-dealing blows have been used by God of War since the beginning\, reviving on the spot or at previous checkpoints has been used in pretty much every game\, the ninja stealth mechanic was the basis of the entire Shinobido series (hell Sekiro even looks like Goh from that game)\, even the revenge story in this game is pretty copy and paste from various other revenge story games.I think that because this is a FromSoftware title\, its getting quite a bit more accolade than it deserves. That's not to say this is a bad game because its not. In terms of action games\, it should satisfy anyone who has an itch for it with FS's trademark difficulty. However\, as far as anything special or new to the genre\, I would argue that Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is more original than Sekiro.TL;DR: Not a bad game\, just over-hyped.… Expand"

For those that don't know\, when you (really) die in Sekiro\, you lose half of your sen and half of the experience earned towards your next point- that is\, unless Unseen Aid occurs\, a random chance to save you from penalties that lessens with subsequent deaths.So let's say you arrive at a boss\, aka one of the places you will be dieing the most at.  You  check your sen and your experience\, finding that you are about half way to your next skill point and a bit shorthanded on coin for the goody you've been saving up for.  The game's systems naturally encourage you to go make sure you complete that skill point and invest your sen in something (for this I believe they realized some of the clunkiness midway through the design process and made sen pouches\, or this game's version of 'soul of a _ undead'\, purchasable from vendors at a minor upcharge).  However\, I don't want to do that.  I want to go bang my head against a boss when I get to it- it's what I like in souls games (and yes this is a souls game\, regardless of the inclusion of posture and z-axis exploration).  It's a minor annoyance on par with occasionally needing to farm for vials in bullets in Bloodborne.The main reason it sticks out a little more to me is the unseen aid mechanic.  When you arrive at that boss\, of course gamers are going to game the system and make sure their currencies are roughly 0.  Almost nobody is so green in the genre anymore to actually believe they would make it out of a boss encounter they've never experienced with anything left anyway.  So then\, what good is unseen aid?  A random chance to save you from..... what exactly?  The answer is that it's basically only good for saving you from unexpected deaths out in the world\, and does nothing in the areas of the game with plentiful expected deaths.Now after a rant like that\, the 9 out of 10 may seem a tad strange\, and that should tell you how good everything else about this game is.  The reason I went into more detail of my one gripe is because it's likely to be one of the only reasonably unique sentiments I have to contribute to a discussion on the game's merits.  So that being said\, I'll keep it short and sweet for the positives.  The combat\, the atmosphere\, the exploration\, the movement...... it's simply amazing.  I won't say that if you like Souls games\, you WILL like Sekiro\, but I will say that if you like Souls games\, you CAN like Sekiro if you give it a chance and learn its combat.  You will have some tough stumbles at first\, but if you are a Souls veteran\, you are made of stern enough stuff to tough it out.As a side note\, I love that it doesn't have the loot systems apparent in Nioh.  I hate having to constantly figure out which version of the same weapon is better.  Part of the reason I like loot in Souls games\, is that a zweihander is a zweihander- yes you can upgrade it in various ways\, but there isn't any sifting of loot.  It's an experience I value in some games\, but not when I'm playing a Souls-like\, and it severely hurt my enjoyment of Nioh.… Expand"

I'm really not sure what game he's playing\, you can break an enemys posture and do a death blow\, but it's not straight forward to get to that point\, Soulsborne games always had a finishing move after parries\, or backstabs....this is the exact same thing\, and nobody claimed those were QTE's\, and just like in those games\, you need to either parry\, more than once on later mobs\, to even get the deathblow\, so it's not like you're just pressing A to one shot everyone.Metacritic should really prune the reviews that exist just to trash a game\, without a basic understanding of it. There's just no way anyone in their right mind could rate this lower than a 6\, even if they couldn't get passed the first boss\, you will still experience enough of the game to appreciate what is being done here\, and that it was your own ineptitude that kept you from proceeding.… Expand"

85778,Sekiro,2019-04-07,8,"Sekiro is a great game in a vacuum. Compared to the 5 previous Soulsborne games however\, it falls short. My review is for people that loved those games\, but haven't picked up Sekiro yet.The biggest issue? Fromsoft took a cleaver to the amount of content they would usually include in the series. Co-op PvE\, PvP\, player messaging/bloodstains\, character creation\, character buildSekiro is a great game in a vacuum. Compared to the 5 previous Soulsborne games however\, it falls short. My review is for people that loved those games\, but haven't picked up Sekiro yet.The biggest issue? Fromsoft took a cleaver to the amount of content they would usually include in the series. Co-op PvE\, PvP\, player messaging/bloodstains\, character creation\, character build customization - all gone.Nominally it was done in order to create a 'more focused' 'action' game\, rather then the 'action RPG' of other Fromsoft titles. The results are not worth the sacrificed elements. The new swordplay system is of course the biggest change\, and it's not bad. Certainly faster\, louder and more bombastic - but I would hesitate to call it better then the understated\, slower\, deliberate pace of Dark Souls. It is a nice change of pace in a game that plays quite similarly in other aspects to its fore-bearers.The new grapple hook and jump mechanic are less of a success. Grapple is limited to very specific locations which are highlighted by a big green circle on the UI. It looks a bit messy\, and the circle will frequently not appear when it should do\, leaving you unable to grapple. The hook is supposed to open up the game world\, but its mostly just smoke and mirrors - there is no more freedom then in previous games\, fromsoft have just been a bit cleverer in disguising the boundaries.The other big addition is the stealth mechanic. It isnt anything special. Imagine whats already in Dark Souls\, add a UI meter telling you when an enemy will spot you and thats basically the gist of it. The enemy AI is essentially braindead\, so do not expect any cool reactions to your characters sneaky antics like in MGS 5 for example.So all those elements removed\, replaced with a decent combat system and so-so grapple and stealth mechanics. The trade doesn't work\, and a lot is cut for little given back.Sadly these cuts extend to other parts of the game. It feels like the developers were working with a much smaller timeframe or budget then in the past. The size of the game world feels quite small\, and you will revisit the Ashina Castle area of the map no less then 4 times over the course of the game. Another early portion of the world\, Hirata Estate\, gets retread in the late game as well. Much worse is the amount of content recycling when it comes to the enemies. Just about every 'miniboss' and a number of big bosses are reused. One of them no less then 5 times! A few others 3 times\, and quite a lot twice. It feels like its all repeated in order to stretch out the play time\, which leads into the difficulty.Yes\, Sekiro is a very hard game. Prepare to struggle through many of the minibosses\, and really struggle with some of the big bosses (the last two boss encounters are extreme\, even if one is optional). Whilst there is nothing wrong with hard games\, there needs to be a balancing act between tough but fair and frustrating. For my own tastes\, Sekiro really straddles that line\, sometimes falling over it. I am a veteran of fromsofts work\, I even remember the joy of buying Dark Souls on release day. For someone with less experience then me\, the difficulty could be overwhelming. In my opinion the high difficulty level\, like the content recycling\, is another way fromsoft have tried to lengthen the game. The longer it takes to clear a boss the longer your playing\, right? If Sekiro's difficulty level was down on the same level as Souls\, it would feel pretty short. Really short if there wasn't so much recycling.Despite not being up to the standard of previous games Sekiro is still very good - its just not quite up there with its predecessors. Here's hoping the numerous cuts made by the developers are in service of something greater - like programmers and modelers being taken off the project to work on Bloodborne 2.… Expand"

There is no enemy before him that launches the same lightning attack for his last form so you can practice return lightning skill before the boss fight. Instead you have to die repeatedly trying to figure out how since it pretty much kills you in one hit if you mess up the execution. Sure you can look up videos and guides.

85790,Sekiro,2019-04-02,5,"Sekiro is a game I wanted to love. Being a huge Dark Souls fan\, I was looking forward to From Software trying something new with their expertise.

It can be incredibly fun inSekiro is a game I wanted to love. Being a huge Dark Souls fan\, I was looking forward to From Software trying something new with their expertise. Instead\, we get a game that has an identity crisis and so many design blunders that is is depressingly astounding.The combat itself is visceral\, fast and when it is all flowing together\, it feels like a dream. It can be incredibly fun in those moments. However\, there is a clear as day lack of variety in the game overall. Weapon variety is at an absolute minimum\, with the only new things you acquire being prosthetic tools and new moves. This simply doesn't hold a candle to From's past games where variety was one of the strongest aspects.The game has a focus on stealth that also can be fun when you are taking enemies down one by one in rapid succession without being noticed\, but this too suffers from immense simplicity in its execution. The stealth system boils down to 'enemy has a cone over their head\, hide for a bit\, they forget you ever existed.' and it is hilarious how easily exploitable this is. The stealth can be fun\, but it is nothing revolutionary in the slightest.Then comes some of the game's biggest issues. The bosses for one. Almost none of them are memorable. The game is filled to the brim with sub-bosses\, to the point of over-saturation. Many of these are so strong that it always verges on being cheap. The main reason is that many of them don't make sense. A samurai general in armor with a huge sword taking hits and dealing big damage? That makes sense. A ragtag woman wearing cloth and straw that uses a metal rod with a dinky blade attached to it doing the same thing? Makes zero sense. This boss in particular can kill you in two hits and yet she absorbs sword blows like they are nothing. Unlike the Souls games\, it holds no consistency in its design.Continuing further with the bosses\, the amount of 100% recycled bosses here is laughable and honestly quite pathetic. Unlike Dark Souls 1 where they reused something like the Asylum demon but perhaps changed the moveset a bit or his appearance\, in Sekiro\, several bosses are literally copied and pasted 100%\, sometimes more than once. Absolutely nothing is different about them except for the name. Eventually I started laughing whenever I would see a clone of a boss I already killed. Like it was a twin sibling or something. It is lazy and deserves no praise\, especially when the bosses themselves are already not memorable in the first place.The pacing can also be a total nightmare. Unlike in Dark Souls where each new boss encounter usually felt grand and important because of the pacing\, Sekiro instead goes for a pace that doesn't know what to do. Sometimes you will go at least 30 minutes without a boss\, giving you ample time to explore your surroundings and take in the atmosphere\, other times you will have *3* sub bosses in the span of 5 minutes\, and considering some of these can absolutely wreck your world even after the slightest mistake\, it becomes draining and tiring. Combine this with locations that are not memorable\, it eventually makes each new area not worth any excitement.Another massive issue I have is the story. Maybe I am missing something entirely\, in fact I HOPE I am missing something\, because the story as I see it is barebones and shallow. Whereas in Dark Souls the story is fed to you in increments and through item descriptions. here it is like that\, but somehow even less informative. Characters often don't have anything interesting to say and the main character himself hardly says anything worthwhile\, often just repeating what an NPC just said only in question form (basically Solid Snake the entire time) or he grunts in response to things. He is hardly fleshed out even after many hours into the game. The basic premise of the game isn't special. It is about as generic as you can get for Japanese storytelling. A generic kid who happens to be a 'divine heir' has a special power in his blood and bad guys want that power to do bad guy things. That is your ENTIRE motivation. It is boring and holds absolutely no weight compared to Dark Souls.As you can tell\, I have a lot of issues with this game\, but I don't hate it. There are times where I am having a ton of fun\, but that fun is often interrupted by bad design\, terrible pacing and a snooze-worthy story. The game also lacks most customization from past FromSoft games\, so the replayability is also very low. I wanted to love this game\, but instead I find it to be painfully average in most regards. It in no way deserves the current 90 critic score it has. It lacks focus and finesse. It is often too punishing for too little reward and it doesn't have anything to truly hook you like a Dark Souls title. I have compared this game to Dark Souls a lot for good reason\, because I know from those games that From Software is capable of so much more. For now\, I can only hope they take lessons from this game and do better.… Expand"

The game is hard but very satisfying\, Art and map design are very inspired\, but the very core of this game is the  amazing gameplay.

Although some features are pretty similar such as the estus flasks for healing. Besides that the new fighting system is quite interesting but to me personally disappointing. It does not feel very appealing sometimes even more mashy although the 60fps combat itself is amazingly fluent.I encountered some frame drops but as it was always on the same screen positions I think it is just a minor optimization problem because besides that the game runs smooth. The graphic is at times beautiful and sometimes a bit disappointing. It lacks details of other current gen titles of that caliber which is not that bad but I feel it still has to be noted because it is noticeable. The soundtrack is good but does not get me driven as other titles aswell. Yet it blends in well with the general theme. The loading times are okay. Strangely they seemed to get better after I was playing for a while\, maybe I just got used to it. It is not as bad as Bloodborne was but still there are noticeably loading times when using the fast travel. Besides that the interconnected world has no loading sequences which is nice.The enemies are okay-ish. I cannot pinpoint describe what is lacking but they do not feel as detailed and charming as other games that FromSoftware delivered. The variety is also a little bit weak. Main and sub bosses are again a hard competition but the posture system feels weird at times when facing them. Also sometimes it feels more like defendin for huge time while dealing 1-2 slashes and wait again. This of course might be intended but to me feels less entertaining.I want to re-visit this review after more play-time as games such as DS or Bloodborne also took some time to get going but the first impression is\, that the game was pretty hyped\, delivered well but it is certainly not the awaited next prodigy from FromSoftware. Thats at least my personal opinion.Interested people should wait for a price drop. I do not see the launce price tag fitting\, yet.… Expand"

I know hardcore fans love all that but it felt tedious to me and I was always disappointed that I couldn't get into them (I got as far as Father Gascoine in BB).Despite all that I still pre-ordered Sekiro because it looked amazing when watching the trailers and gameplay videos. I'm happy to say that I have finally found a From Soft game that I can actually enjoy. This game is hard AF but it's so good and when you die it doesn't feel unfair or cheap. The combat is fast and fluid and the movement feels unrestricted and free (can actually jump and climb!). The skills tree is way better than having a list of stats as well\, and after each boss you get a prayer bead\, once you get 4 you can unlock a health & posture boost. This takes away the grinding element as you can't just grind to improve health or posture before a boss. This probably makes it harder in some ways but I prefer it.The story is also a lot clearer (although you still have to piece things together) and a proper protagonist is much better IMO as it gives some purpose to what you are doing.  I haven't completed it yet I've just got past the poisonous drunkard boss from the trailer but so far I'm loving it.If you like action adventure games then you will definitely love this as it's incredible.  Even if you don't like soulsborne games give this one a try as it's a lot more accessible than previous titles. The combat and general movement are more fluid\, the checkpoints are spread out more sensibly\, and there is much more overall polish in terms of final product.… Expand"

The game being based on a specific character / weapon allowed them to make something incredibly focused while retaining signature From oddness\, ambiguity\, and intricate world design.People saying the combat is just about parrying now have not mastered the combat. In practice\, deflection works pretty differently than parrying in Dark Souls. There's so much more nuance to the combat now\, from crowd control options\, when to jump\, dodge\, block or deflect\, move interruptions\, combat arts\, combos with prosthetic attachments good against certain enemies\, etc. The posture system alone makes it completely different than Dark Souls. You can not play it like those games even if it seems like you can get away with it.  If you're playing well you will be aggressive\, attacking often and performing very deliberate moves against specific enemies.Once the combat clicked I was amazed at how fluid and fun it can be\, and that a lot of tough enemies can be taken down pretty quickly if you play well. One thing it does have in common with Souls is that the longer a boss stays alive\, the harder it is to deal with. And like Dark Souls it's a difficult game because it wants you to learn how to play it right\, and execution in Sekiro is even more challenging\, and even more satisfying than From's other games.… Expand"

Sekiro takes the learnings from the recent FromSoft games and makes them into a classic stealth-action game with a twist.

This is not my first from software game\, I have been with them since Demon's Souls and I had hit brick walls back then\, but the bosses were fun and even dying after a few times I felt like if I kept trying I could eventually come out victorious. Not here\, some of the bosses in this game will just kill you in matter of seconds if you make even the slightest mistake.As I have gotten older my reflexes are not quite what they use to be and this game punishes me for that over and over again. You can really feel the Activision in this with them always wanting everything to be super-fast paced. Which is weird\, because it is only that way with the bosses and some of the mini bosses\, but the open world is on the other side of that? You can slowly go around and stealth kill enemies and take as much time as you want to clear out an area before going to the next.The biggest difference with this and souls games are that in souls\, you can build a character to fit YOUR fighting style. Playing as a cool shinobi is pretty fun\, but if it’s not your style this game will suck for you. Also in Souls games when you hit a brick wall you could go back and level some or try to upgrade your gear in some way and take on the encounter again. In Sekiro you hit a wall you are pretty much SOL\, because the only way to get stronger is to kill bosses or mini bosses. So if you were like me when you would hit a brick wall\, you would go try to upgrade somehow and go back. This may not be the game for you; because I have fought one boss so many times I lost count. Sometimes I would get them to the secret third phase (no surprise there)\, I would be all out of gourds (flasks) and would be struck down in seconds.On the bright side of things\, this games open world is awesome\, it’s beautiful\, the stealth is neat and counter system is pretty fun. It just not enough to fun for when you hit a brick wall and can't get passed it. So if you really want to try it\, I would suggest buying it used somewhere or wait for a sale at the very least. It is worth trying to see if it is something you may like or not\, because to each their own. My last side note is the first 10 hours or so you will have you ups and downs\, it’s not till later you will hit the brick walls.With that said\, this is not the From Software I know and love; this is something I won't even bother to beat. I purchased this game digitally\, because I thought \""oh it’s From Software\, I'm sure I will love it.\"" To tell you the truth\, if I had a psychical copy\, the game would already be returned or sold off.… Expand"

Controlling a sole protagonist one-armed ninja who fight against demons and their minions. The main character “Okami” will be facing with numerous strong enemies\, such as: giant snake\, golem-like undead samurai warriors\, ogres\, kunoichis and lots of inhuman beings throughout the game.Comparing to Dark Souls series\, Sekiro is a quite different game. You can either finish off your opponents by full stealth technique or one vs all melee combat style. You can sneak on the ledges\, roofs\, hills or hiding in the bushes\, inside of the walls (just like Tenchu series). Our main character can learn new techniques and collect many new items\, power-ups in addition to to his sub-weapons. The combat is heavily based on “sword on sword” gameplay. You can also use your “grappling hook” a lot along with the other gears you have. Unlike the Souls series\, you have to be capable with one single character and his skills. Battle and dodge system is perfect despite some difficulties you have to struggle with\, at the beginning.I can clearly say that boss battles so tough yet super fascinating (sometimes frustrating). So therefore\, game gives you a ressurrection option whenever you beaten up. Not to mention this is a fast paced game.There are some similarity between the Souls game and Sekiro since it’s the spiritual successor of Souls games. Boss fights\, bonfires and estus-like potions just some of them. The campaign has influenced by Souls/Bloodborne theme. The atmosphere is so epic\, especially during the boss battles. Surprisingly some clashes are harder then any normal boss battle.Visuals are gorgeous but i can’t say the same for the frame-rates. Even PS4 Pro and Xbox One X can’t handle with the stable frame rate at lower resolutions (it barely hits 45fps). This is a big flaw of the game unfortunately\, i hope they fixed it with a proper patch soon.

While some may be upset by this\, the trademarks of a FromSoftware game that have lent themselves to the global acclaim attained by Miyazaki's prior works are present in this game\, arguably at their strongest implementation so far.The vertical design of the world of Ashina allows for more in depth exploration than almost any other game\, giving the player a variety of options for each encounter. Barge in\, guns blazing\, and mow down everyone who stands in your way? Sure. Want to sneak through the grass and stealthily take down hordes of enemies to prevent engaging the entire group? Absolutely. Use your grappling hook to soar between buildings and avoid confrontation all together? Sekiro allows that. Despite removing the RPG elements\, the freedom of choice in how a player can tackle combat situations is more diverse than it's ever been. Freedom of movement also lends itself to this player agency\, with the player's shinobi being able to parkour up walls\, swing across canyons\, and shimmy across cliff ledges.The death system is very well executed\, to an extent. Too many revivals will cause any characters you've interacted with to fall ill with Dragonrot\, preventing interaction with them until one returns to an Idol and heals the characters. The downside of Dragonrot rears its ugly head with the Unseen Aid mechanic: A random chance that the downsides of player death (losing half of the current experience and currency) will be avoided that decreases with each instance of Dragonrot caused. While a viable way to punish a player for abusing the revival mechanic\, having this potentially grind-saving skill left up to random chance is sure to cause frustration with multiple players.In addition\, some items crucial to boss battles are hard to come across and very limited in how many the game will allow a player to access. This can lead to increased frustration upon a failed boss attempt or misuse of an item.Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is undoubtedly one of the best games of the current console generation.

Instead of swapping in gear to help against fire like in Dark Souls\, I'm spending all of my time thinking of new\, improved\, or perfected strategies.  In DS the boss strategy often came down to just hanging back\, learning attack patterns\, now dodge and pick away.  In Sekiro sometimes you have to be on the defensive\, sometimes you have to be full offense\, and everything in between.  Super satisfying and HARD.9 for now\, I expect a 10 when I'm done.Update: Instant classic\, easy 10.  The game is even harder than I thought it was halfway through.  Even after beating everything else the final boss feels like an insane difficulty spike.  This game is not for everyone\, but if you're up to the challenge I can't recommend it enough.… Expand"

So from this perspective I can tell all who fall into this boat that Sekiro is a game of contradictions. It is difficult\, challenging\, and certainly NOT a game you play just to relax. That being said\, if you play it\, there is something about this game that keeps you wanting to come back.The world itself\, set in feudal Japan\, is absolutely breathtaking. It is authentic\, regal\, mature\, taking aspects of Japanese history/mythology and highly immersive. I found myself sometimes just standing in one spot and moving the camera around just to admire the design. By the way\, do this often in the game\, there are many hidden areas that can be overlooked if you aren't aware of your surroundings. The story is equally engaging\, and you begin to really take a liking for the character you play as you progress in the game.But the greatest factor of this game is its controls. I've played lots of games in my lifetime\, but I have never played a game whose controls were so fluid and perfect. After five minutes of playtime I was surprised how organic the controls were. And\, by extension\, this drastically elevates the combat system. Suffice it to say you actually feel like you are holding the katana when fighting NPCs. It will take some time to learn the combat\, however. The enemies in the game aren't messing around\, they are just as skilled if not more skilled than you are. With practice and PATIENCE you'll become the Shinobi the game requires you to be.All-in-all this game is beautiful\, challenging\, brutal\, and so rewarding to play. It challenges the gamer to become precise in combat\, aware of surrounding and\, in a nutshell\, gain an intelligence that not many games offer. In terms of warnings\, be prepared to die A LOT. If you can get through this game with minimal causalities you are a god. But if you are a vanilla mortal like the rest of us\, you will certainly enjoy getting your ass kicked in a stunningly beautiful way :PThus far this is the best game of 2019 and actually has made it to my top ten best games I have ever played easily.… Expand"

It clings to the structure and elements of the SoulsBorne games but desperately wants to be something different. Namely\, an action sword-fighting game in the vein of Ninja Gaiden. The stealth and grapple mechanics make adventuring through the world much less threatening and more accessible\, while they've made the bosses so impenetrably difficult as to alienate anyone that isn't a \""git gud\"" snob. It's not particularly immersive as an adventure and it's often frustrating and time-consuming in its action. The pieces didn't gel for me\, and the experience ultimately boiled down to a long list of hard\, punitive bosses that made the game difficult to enjoy... but admittedly\, I couldn't put it down.At the surface\, Sekiro appears to be a spiritual continuation of Dark Souls and Bloodborne. You explore an interconnected dark fantasy world\, collect items to help in battle\, grow stronger\, and fight a horde of monsters and villains. However\, I'd strongly suggest you leave your expectations at the door as this is a totally different beast.From an adventure or exploration standpoint\, Sekiro falters a bit. It differs by introducing stealth and a grapple hook\, both resembling those of Batman Arkham and other AAA games. These mechanics work just fine but neither offers a ton of depth or skill and both of them trivialize the exploration. The grapple has also caused the levels to become more linear\, just hiding usable items in every corner that you'll never use. Sprinting (or grappling!) past enemies is more effective than ever\, with little incentive to fight them as the leveling system has been nerfed into a perk-system\, most of which you'll never use. Stealth can be abused to defeat enemies one-by-one and even if you go in guns blazing\, most standard enemies can be defeated by mashing the attack button all the way up to the last area. As hard as this game's bosses are\, it's shockingly easy to get around the world and kill grunt enemies. Hence\, the experience is a bit disjointed. Combine all that with the by-the-numbers Sengoku Japan storyline and the fact that there are only 8 linear levels and Sekiro fails to offer a substantial or immersive adventure for the player.The real meat of Sekiro comes in its combat and specifically its bosses. There are over 50 bosses and mini-bosses\, making for a daunting quest. I lost count of how many of these I had to fight 5+ times\, with the final boss taking me 30-50 tries over 3-4 hours. Sekiro is not for the faint of heart\, approach with caution. This is substantially harder than Dark Souls and Bloodborne and they've removed leveling and summoning\, which effectively served as those games' difficulty-select. You simply have to play these fights over and over until you've learned their patterns and can parry and punish appropriately. It's basically a rhythm game where you need to respond to each attack with one of a handful of actions. It's challenging and can be rewarding but it's far from the ground-breaking combat system it's being praised as. The \""git gud\"" hype behind this game implies there to be a large component of skill but I found it to be much more a matter of trial-and-error. I don't care how \""gud\"" you are\, some of these bosses will wreck you on your first couple tries due to how fast and unpredictable they are. Also\, many of the bosses can be more easily and safely defeated by running in circles and poking when open\, making the core mechanics pointless.Unfortunately\, Sekiro can't leave well enough alone\, and feels the need to up the ante with extraneous difficulty at every turn. Like Dark Souls 2\, you start with 1 healing item and almost no health\, making the early-game unnecessarily difficult and sure to make many quit in frustration. In spite of its focus on action\, Sekiro retains the bonfires and running back to bosses after death from Dark Souls. I think proper checkpoints would have better meshed with the trial-and-error combat here. Some mini-bosses can be stealth killed too\, requiring some elaborate setup\, meaning you'll have to redo that too every time you die. The die-twice mechanic gives you one extra screw-up but From seems to have used this as an excuse to push extra-hard rather than it being a tool for success. And lastly\, a couple end-game bosses have 3+ phases and feel like complete overkill.Due to all this exacerbating what is already a demanding combat system\, I found Sekiro to be immensely frustrating for about 50% of my playthrough. Every time I'd fight a fair\, rewarding boss\, it would throw me another that would twist my arm in painful\, unexpected ways. If challenge for the sake of challenge is your thing\, by all means have a blast! For everyone else\, approach with caution. Sekiro lacks the immersive appeal of SoulsBorne\, while offering a brutal combat experience that can be more frustrating and time-consuming than it is rewarding.… Expand"

You want to be entertained by the story and enjoy good gameplay. It should be challenging in a way\, but fair at all times and you should never feel that the game is unfair.Developers have in the past gone over to adjusting the level of difficulty without the player's knowledge and during the game if you fail too often. If you don't make a section again and again\, the enemies are suddenly weakened quantitatively and qualitatively. This is called \""adaptive difficulty\"" in technical jargon. It should guarantee that the player remains \""in the flow\"" and constantly experiences success without weakening his ego. The player usually doesn't notice this at all\, he is happy about his success and the fun of the game remains. If an average player fails too often on an average difficulty level at a certain point\, the developer has done something wrong at exactly this point. At least that's the current theory and prevailing opinion among developers.Well\, and then From Software came around the corner... with a \""slightly\"" different approach. Different levels of difficulty? There isn't. There is only one: ultra-heavy. You really have to train to master the fighting system thoroughly if you want to get ahead here. And you have to understand the world and how it works. In Sekiro we are talking about a wonderfully designed world which has a story to tell. In this world we play our protagonist\, who has to keep his honor and would do anything for it\, no matter how difficult and hopeless the situation looks. The protagonist would sacrifice everything for it and he has to train hard and develop further if he wants to master the challenges he faces. Nothing more this game demands from the player himself: Develop yourself further\, train yourself and face the challenges. An important prerequisite for such a challenging game is extremely good control and a perfect fighting system. Sekiro delivers both.We have to explore this fantastic world and conquer the enormous dangers. Either we master this challenge with virtuosity\, or we fail grandiosely. In between there is nothing at all. If we meet a boss in Sekiro and he turns out to be a true master of sword art\, then this opponent can only be defeated if we become the better master. And that requires a lot of hard work. And it requires one thing above all else: before we defeat our opponents\, we must defeat ourselves. We have to learn that failure is not frustrating. Failure is training. Failure is instructive. The game does not give us a sense of achievement\, we have to work it out for ourselves. That's exactly what many players don't like. But in a certain way Sekiro not only makes us a better player with this approach\, but also a better person. Because here you learn something incredibly important\, which also has an enormous relevance in real life: The world doesn't owe us that it's fair and just. Why should it? If we want to achieve something\, we have to work hard. And it's a lot of fun when the hard work pays off.At the end of the game you actually feel like you've gone through a development.

Most bosses in the game serve excellent challenges which test your skill as a player and in some cases teach you new skills and techniques. For example Gyobou Masataka Oniwa\, being the first main boss in the game\, helps teach the player the importance of blocking and parrying. Unless the player adapts to this style of playing they will obviously die over and over and for me\, a dark souls veteran\, it became a challenge to not constantly dodge roll away from attacks but once I had mastered the block and parry mechanic the game became so much more enjoyable. However not every boss is as perfect as that for example the first corrupted monk can easily be killed by abusing firecracker and fistfuls of ash but overall the bosses are solid  and always provide a good challenge. In conclusion the game is absolutely solid but it has its issues with easily cheeseable bosses  and broken items which make the game a cakewalk… Expand"

The areas were a bit too similar in my opinion\, minus two to three changes of pace (Senpou\, Fountainhead\, Hirata to a lesser extent)\, and there seemed to be less overall areas to explore. I found the \""optional\"" areas to be somewhat lacking as well\, as some of the optional bosses were just retreads of previous bosses with a twist and several of them took place on the same battlefield as a prior fight. Nonetheless\, the boss fights in Sekiro are top notch. As far as overall consistency of quality\, this is FromSoft's best effort to date. From the first main boss encounter on\, each one (with maybe two exceptions) is a challenging and adrenaline-pumping clash of swords. Even the classic gimmick fight found in every SoulsBorne game is improved here in almost every level: the gorgeous visuals\, enjoyment\, arena\, etc. Having a lone katana as the main weapon also allowed FromSoft to make their bosses as unique as possible\, displayed in their fighting style as well as their design\, without having to worry about what approach the player is taking (like the Souls series: spellcaster\, dex\, strength\, etc.). The enemy variety was kind of bland\, mostly humanoid\, but narratively I understand that was kind of necessary. The mini bosses were also a nice break-up between exploring en route to the next big bad and offered vital rewards upon defeat\, though there were far too many re-skins in this department and some of them were just a chore to to fight. Another highlight of FromSoft's last few games has been the excellent and riveting soundtracks. Having played Bloodborne and Dark Souls III nearing Sekiro's release\, I found the soundtrack a bit underwhelming (which was my mistake of expectation). However\, upon replays the music has really grown on me and definitely fits the world perfectly. Some tracks that stand out are CM\, LB\, ISS\, O\, and GA (boss initials). Final point of praise: the combat\, once understood\, is probably the most satisfying I've ever played in a videogame. Although it isn't quite the masterpiece I expected\, it is definitely my early 2019 GOTY in an already crowded year and a game that was well worth the wait. Already itching to see what FromSoft comes up with next. 8.9/10.… Expand"

They are looked cool as first but once you play the gamethoroughly\, you will come to the conclusion that those things are just small gimmicks. Especially the skill moves\, all of them are hardly be said that they are better than your normal attack. (Except\, the skill called icjimon double\, that one may be only skill that can be very useful in some fights). On the top of that\, you can equip only 1 skill move at time\, you can't even quick swap skill move. What the heck is with that ? This is 2018\, there are so many games that allows you equip 4 skills at the same time. It is 100% possible. Does Miyazaki think it will be imbalance to do that ? I don't really understand at all.Prothestic tools\, however\, can be helpful but it has limited use. In the end\, what you will do most is  normal attack\, which lead to the lack of diversity in this game\, thus lead to less replayability than other soul titles..2. Stealth mechanic is too powerful. You can kill most of enemies along the way with stealh\, or just sneak past them\, which makes combat along the way become trivial. The game only hard when come to boss fight that you can't stealth kill. Even Minibosses\, you can outright destory half of their hp with stealth . What is fun about that ?. This game shines most from combat mechanic\, not stealth mechanic. However\, because stealth has almost no risk (very easy to do) but get same reward (exp) like you fight head on\, so why should I fight head on ?. Moreover\, stealth mechanic in this game is very mediocre\, you get behind enemy or jump from above\, that is it. I hope stealth get nerfed hard. It is ok to sneak pass\, but not outright kill high hg enemies or half minibosses hp\, right now it is way too strong..3.No multiplayer ? admit it\, this decrease replayability. Besides\, without coop system\, many people can't finished this game due to the sheer difficulty. I am fine but some of my friends will not be able to play it..That is all for Sekiro. Beating the game first time I spent 50 hrs (but I explored and farmmed a lot to test each skill\, the actual time should be like 30 hrs ). I definitely buy Sekiro 2 or DLC but for now\, I think the all skill moves need hard buffs. Prothestic tools needs to more love with the upgraded version. Please nerf the stealth kill.

The parkour and stealth aspects allow you to skip enemies if you please\, or you can rush in and deflect your way through with fast-paced\, intense combat.Unlike Soulsborne\, it also has a very vibrant colour palette to it. While there aren't many areas that stick out significantly\, the various green and sometimes pink mixed into the gray\, dark environments that FROM used to make really help motivate you to continue on\, no matter how often you fail at a boss. And as usual\, the end boss is really great.However\, I should point out that if you don't have a lot of patience\, this game is NOT for you. Memorizing a moveset from a boss takes time and effort. And you will die a lot.Sadly\, one of the downsides is that this game lacks replay value. If you want to get all trophies\, you will have to either play through the game 5+ times or grind. I felt like the NG+ and further became worse and worse throughout the series\, with Dark Souls 3 only changing item locations.

Combat can be approached in different ways depending on your playstyle can chose to be stealthy or going head to head with the ennemies. The game gives you the means to power up your character accodingly. Skill points let you learn new abbilities depending on the branch you pick; you can find\, equip\, and upgrade ninja tools that serve as secondary weapons with limited use. Upgrading your character's physical attribute is also possible by finding specific items. The level design in this game really shines as it demonstrates multi layered areas with plenty of branching paths. And it works hand in hand with the agility of the protagonist to make you feel like a true shinobi once you have become famiar with the controls. Like other games from this developer exploration is rewarded with items from the useful consumable to a brand new prohestetic tool.Visually the game manages to give a unique personality to each area. The lighting is especialy efficient and changes dynamicaly as you move in and out of the buildings. The animations are fluid and allow you to read you opponents attacks which is a crucial part of the game. My only beef with the game is the steep learning curve. Most Souls veteran will forgive this aspect but the uniniciated will surely have a hard time geting comfortable with the game as there is no way to change the difficulty.

If you think you’ll fly through this game because you're a Soulsborne veteran\, or if you think the combat is something easy to pick up\, I advise you to readjust your expectations.

This is a brutal game\, one that will be challenging for veterans and newbies alike. However\, if you have the motivation to persist\, I think you'll find that Sekiro offers one of the most fulfilling and diverse gameplay experiences in modern times.The area design of Sekiro is absolutely brilliant. The world can be broken down into central hubs that each interconnect and branch out into other areas. There is a vast world to be explored\, and each distinct area is equipped with its own atmosphere\, level layout and enemy types. Moreover\, there is a new dimension of verticality introduced into the area design\, meaning players can not only explore on a planar level\, but also can move upwards and explore that way as well. All this creates an exploration experience that is quite engaging.Sekiro boasts a new combat style focused on aggressive gameplay and deflecting enemy attacks. I’ll say it now: if you play the game like Dark Souls\, you won’t get far. This is a new system\, and that’s perfectly ok because this game isn’t Dark Souls and doesn’t want to be. Truth be told\, when I started out the game I was frustrated that I couldn’t get a handle on this combat system. I was ready to put down the game and call it quits. But after my second or third boss\, the combat finally clicked and I started to have fun with the system. And it’s quite an intricate and fun combat system\, probably as good as Bloodborne’s combat in my eyes.To top it all off\, bosses and minibosses are the most engaging they’ve been. Some of these bosses have become my all time favorite bosses in gaming history. Although there is the occasional cheap fight\, I’m impressed by how the game from start to finish is able to churn out incredibly different and challenging bosses.Sekiro is a VERY strong 9/10. I can’t really consider it a 10/10 because it does have its fair share of flaws. One of these flaws is the storytelling; Sekiro attempts to tell a more structured narrative than that of Dark Souls and Bloodborne\, but unfortunately it fails to be coherent. It seems those involved with the storywriting couldn’t tell if they wanted the story to be more ambiguous like in DS/BB or if it should be clear-cut\, so they just opted for both; as such\, the story feels somewhat befuddled and confusing at times\, with no rhyme or reason to why events occur or why we should care.Another flaw would be the lack of diversity in the skill trees. A lot of these skills\, maybe half\, don’t really help that much in combat. Out of all the skill trees\, only one has skills that all are useful; the rest have maybe 2-3 useful skills and then 7-8 useless skills.Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is quite an achievement. It had a lot to live up to\, and boy did it surpass expectations. This is a game that takes some of the best aspects of the Soulsborne series and revitalizes it in a refreshing\, innovative way. Those who invest in the game will find an incredibly rewarding and fun journey\, but unfortunately there are those who don't want to invest the time and would rather criticize the game as unfair and a 0/10 without understanding how the game and its underlying combat mechanics work. Sekiro is a strong 9/10\, and since FromSoft has never disappointed with its DLC\, I expect in the near future we’ll get some more great Sekiro content that will elevate the game to 10/10.… Expand"

And as every major boss has a different strategy\, this turn into a long session of learning before you finally can kill the boss and proceed.Now this is the usual Dark Souls formula - but: no leveling up and no coop help. Which means the game is unforgiving forcing you to learn and execute everything perfectly (hence \""difficulty\""). And here is the problem\, after the umpteen boss\, faced with yet another 2-3 hours of learning and dying and repeating (and praying for luck)\, you don't feel the challenge anymore - you feel just tired of it. The \""wow\"" moment after finally winning (which for me happened just once - and I'm at the last one) goes and is replaced by \""i hope the next boss is not another slog\"".I can understand really hard-core gamers\, the one loggin 12 hours a day in the first week\, getting very good at this game - after all once you learn it it is much easier to play.

Instantly one of my favourite recent games\, it will stay with me for a long time. The overall presentation of the game is impeccable - the world is gorgeous\, the soundtrack is grandiose and animation is smooth. From sakura-filled mountainscapes to eerie sunken valleys and huge Sengoku castles\, Sekiro is without a doubt my favourite medieval Japan setting in a game (something we've seen a resurgence of recently). The interface is streamlined\, HUD uncluttered and is a joy to behold.But\, as an action game\, the emphasis has to be on gameplay - it's slick\, brutal and rhythmic with a huge amount of freedom in your moment-to-moment actions in lieu of a reduced focus on RPG stats/builds. Learning to deflect and counter enemy attacks at lightning speed while maintaining an aggressive playstyle is key to succeeding in this game. Your aim is to break the enemy's posture (similar to stamina) either by continually attacking them/deflecting their attacks or by chipping away their vitality with slashes which ultimately reduces their posture recovery. It's a polished\, near-perfect system that works two ways - you need to keep an eye on your own posture as powerful enemies smash you with halberds\, their fists and sword flurries. It's immensely satisfying and I can honestly say it's my favourite combat system in recent memory.Instead of making your way from boss to boss\, Sekiro mixes it up with a heightened focus on mini-bosses and general level layouts. You'll make your way through huge\, vertically expansive area taking out soldiers with stealth\, and fighting upwards of 30 mini-bosses which makes the stretches between main bosses much more engaging and less transitional. Stealth is ALWAYS a good option and in fact\, you'll truly struggle taking everything head-on. It's worth sneaking around\, scoping the areas and picking off sentries before battling the main foe in a true test of your abilities. It's a tough game to say the least\, but has that irresistible charm that keeps you trying once more for that unbeatable feeling of satisfaction in the end. If you die\, you lose half of your money and experience points\, but this can always be planned for (keep your money in bags\, grind to secure your next experience level)\, but adds a familiar punishing element to the game. Of course\, as the game's title says\, Shadows Die Twice. You can resurrect yourself once on death (twice on occasions) if you're near to beating an enemy\, a tactical ploy which can really help or hinder you. The consequences of dying go beyond your own suffering - NPCs in the world will become sicker the more you die\, adding in-game hurdles when a merchant is too sick to trade with you or a quest is locked. You can periodically heal them\, but it never truly goes away so be careful!The main gimmick of the gameplay is Sekiro's prosthetic arm\, which can be fitted with a grappling hook\, axe\, foldable shield\, firecracker launcher\, and many other gadgets. These turn the tide of battles and add another exciting element to battles. Upgrades increase their duration\, damage\, effectiveness or even functionality\, and reward you experimenting with different unusual techniques. Skill trees replace most RPG features (stats are upgraded as you beat bosses)\, and is actually quite intuitive. It reminded me a lot of God of War (PS4) in that adding skills genuinely impacts on the game and improves the combat experience. Thrust counters\, posture-recovering strikes\, extra prosthetic functions\, better posture damage\, all contribute to an already deceivingly tactical system.Finally\, the story is great. It is direct\, while maintaining a host of hidden lore tidbits that expand the more philosophical and paranormal aspects of the game. The characters are likable\, the voice acting (Japanese and English) is fantastic and the whole thing has a hard-to-describe melancholy to it unlike anything I've experienced. This may be due to the beautiful environments and gravity of the central task in the story\, but it is different to the dread of Bloodborne or depression of Dark Souls. I absolutely loved the way the story heads in the end and the small extras on the side have kept me pondering for days after completion (which there are 4 ways to end).Sekiro has some tiny flaws\, namely the annoying and gimmicky 'apparition' enemies\, inconvenient merchants\, very grindy higher level skill acquisition and occasional camera-caused deaths\, but these are so minor when compared to the rest of the game. I've enjoyed this game more than anything played this year. It is a near-masterpiece in my eyes and should never be boiled down to its changes from the Souls series. Its merits are numerous\, it's streamlined to a particular gameplay style which helps everything stay tight and focused\, and it's incredibly fun. Judge it on its own\, as everything should be.… Expand"

It's fascinating to find new paths and follow them as you search for mini bosses\, merchants and secrets.The story is also pretty interesting and it's surprisingly straightforward for a fromsoftware game.

I came into this game with mixed expectations. As a soulsbourne veteran\, i was worried about a game without customization\, and parry/deflection based combat but it just simply works perfectly in this context. The combat quick paced combat is intense and satisfying. The removal of the stamina bar allows you to focus on the enemy and what they are doing rather than staring at your green bar go up and down. To me\, the combat with bosses reminded me of learning an intricate dance with ebb and flow. Most fights require an aggressive mindset where you chip away at the bosses posture\, but you must also know the proper response to everything the boss can through at you including the perilous attacks. These unblockable but can usually be highly countered. When the opponent uses a thrust attack\, you can dodge into it to perform a mikiri counter. These do massive pasture damage and allows you to continue your aggression.  In true FromSoftware fashion the boss fights are incredible and beating them is a rush i haven't found in any other game developer. While i was sad to see weapon customization go by the way side\, FromSoftware was able to prefect the katana is every way.  This isnt to say customization is gone either. The game allows you to experiment with the prosthetic attachments\, and includes FromSoftware's first to my knowledge skill tree.I can't begin to explain how amazing the world building is in this game.

I hesitate to even compare it to Dark Souls\, because it is so\, so different. However\, I will since I know that is on everyone's mind - including my own. I have played all of the Dark Souls games and have thoroughly enjoyed them. When taken in it's own light\, Sekiro it is fairly close to perfect. It does have some blemishes\, but the luster is almost blinding at this point. I think if players can stop trying to shoe horn it into the Dark Souls catalogue\, they will learn to love it.Tenchu is one of my all time favorite games\, it arrived on the market in 1998 for the PS1. To look at the graphics today and marvel at how it was even playable back then\, is a demonstration of just how far game engines have come. Many games owe their success to Tenchu\, being a pioneer of stealth tactical games. The unique play style is as engaging now as it was 20 years ago.The level design is incredible. This is one instance where sharing resources with Dark Souls is not a bad thing. I've only been playing for a few days\, and I have not cleared very much of the game\, but the environment so far is breath taking. It begs to be explored\, and there are a plethora of corners to find and inspect. That cliff dropping into the bottomless chasm has a shelf to drop down to\, provided you figure out the path to it. That rocky outcrop that seems unreachable actually is\, and getting there is half the fun.I read so many complaints in this board that Sekiro is a poor excuse for a Dark Souls / Nioh love child. Yes\, it is. However\, that is not what this game is about. A Ferrari makes a poor work truck\, and Sekiro is the Ferrari. I've played all the Dark Souls and I love them. They are great games. That doesn't mean this is a bad game. If you think it is a bad game because it's not Dark Souls\, you're missing the point.I noticed right away that the controls are lightning fast and responsive\, but not squirrely. Playing Dark Souls\, I always feel like I'm moving with drag\, even if I'm skinny rolling. There's just so much weight to the controls\, albeit with very concise feedback; well\, not Dark Souls 2\, feedback was horrible in DS2. Sekiro is about maneuvering into an advantageous position with speed and then executing that advantage. A purpose that is succinctly delivered upon. I get excited when I see the opportunity to chain the grappling hook action to \""Spider Man\"" my way around the area\, and I achieve a great sense of accomplishment from stealth take downs.Unlike Dark Souls\, this game has a coherent story which unfolds as you play. This doesn't have an esoteric lore that will take a community of YouTube streamers 3 years to unravel by reading item descriptions and hyper analyzing the fleeting lines of speech from NPCs. Sekiro's story It's woven into the progress of the game\, the story will compel you to reach just a little farther to get the next verse and learn more about the protagonist and his charge.This game does share some common mechanics and story telling techniques with Dark Souls. I found it uncanny and unnecessary. There is a central hub where a female avatar will unveil story elements and upgrade your Sunny D\, there's a crafts man who whiles away his time while you're not around by crafting items of his desire\, there are fast travel points that act as leveling spots. These are all cosmetic\, since the bedrock of Dark Souls is min - maxing your spec\, playing fashion Souls and gitting gud.Another place where this game suffers is the heavy reliance on \""hit and run tactics\"". Unfortunately\, the enemy placement seems at times to be inconsiderate of this. Or they expect an assassin to barrel head long into groups of enemies. It's just not practical to fight an enemy head on while two or more take shots at you.Should you play this game? If you expect it to be Dark Souls and wont forgive it for not being so\, then no. Save yourself the trouble. However\, if any of what I've said sparks an interest in you\, then yes\, you should.… Expand"

Long-time fan of the ridiculous difficulty\, Demon Souls (closely followed by Bloodborne) is my favourite game of all time\, and I love dark souls too.Sekiro is a bit of a different bag. It's a good game\, the movement is fun\, as are the ninja tools\, and the stealth is well integrated into the general gameplay - and particularly with minibosses. However\, I think this will be the first FromSoft game I don't try to platinum. Mainly because I don't think I'll play through it more than once.The bosses are not so much difficult as long\, everything has lots of health and the classic secret third phase is thrown into the mix too. Remember fighting those demons in DS3 expansion\, when they morph into an even bigger demon when they die... well it's that. The frustration of Nameless King's second phase where it takes so long to get to it. None of this I'd mind on its own\, except you don't get to build a character anymore.You can earn experience and unlock skills\, but these don't really change your fighting prowess the way maxing a quality build would\, or getting a new weapon. Upgrades (at least in terms of damage) are contingent on defeating bosses\, so again sometimes you smash against a brick-wall of difficulty\, but can't go off and build your character to come back stronger. You just hit it again and again. Obvs\, with no co-op this also rules out that as a way to overcome a particularly **** boss (looking at you Fume Knight from DS2).The world is good\, the story is much less subtle but I guess that's fine given there is an actual narrative\, but with no new builds to try\, and no desire to fight some of the bosses again\, I think I'll be putting it down when I'm done and playing through one of the others again.Fingers crossed for Blooborne 2!… Expand"

First and foremost\, Sekiro is not a souls game.Sekiro shares many similarities with the Souls games\, but Sekiro is a whole new beast.  Gone are the days of leaving messages for other players.  Gone are the days of other players for that matter\, as Sekiro is only a solo experience.  That aspect does not bother me so much as I prefer single player experiences anyways.In the Souls-Borne series if I ran into a frustrating situation there was always an option of going back and doing some grinding to help level up in an effort to conquer the roadblock in my way.  After finally getting past those roadblocks there was an immense feeling of accomplishment.  I find the bosses in Sekiro are so frustrating that I leave feeling defeated and have no drive to continue.  And with no leveling up of your character\, and no gear to swap out and try\, there is no motivation to continue bashing my head against the wall.Sekiro is a beautiful game aesthetically speaking\, but the frustration outweighs the beauty.  It feels like FromSoft took the difficulty aspect of the Souls-Borne series and cranked it to 11 just for the sake of making it difficult.  Sneaking around like a ninja and picking off the \""trash\"" mobs feels like that is what the game was supposed to be.  Realizing that the bosses needed to be challenging it feels like FromSoft overcompensated and crossed that line which separates difficult-fun and difficult-frustrating.There is good to be found here\, do not get me wrong.  Sekiro is a beautiful game with tight controls.  The frustration found in the game overshadow everything Sekiro does well.  The one thing a game should always be is fun.  For me\, this is where Sekiro fails\, it becomes so frustrating that it is no longer fun.There are going to be plenty who do not agree with me.  And that is ok.  This is just my honest opinion\, my honest review.  I really\, REALLY\, wanted to like Sekiro.  The only other game I am looking forward to as much as Sekiro is Cyberpunk 2077\, and it saddens me to think how disappointed I am with Sekiro.If you go into Sekiro expecting a souls-like experience\, you will be sorely disappointed.… Expand"

Unfortunately it was like Fromsoft decided to stick it to us long time players and reverse everything you learned from dying over the years.  This game takes fast reflexes and a lot of motivation to push through the many\, many deaths before you unlearn and relearn what you need to survive.  It is punishingly difficult with lightning reflexes and perfect timing required (no mistakes or your dead).  The world and story are not really doing anything for me\, which is what I always loved about the past games.  They always had you guessing what the next level/world would be.  This one is all Feudal Japan all the time and I do not care about Japanese history.  I didn't in college and I still don't.  So the verticality of the game that everyone is praising is overrated.  The grappling hook mechanics work okay\, but only in the spots the game lets you use it.  The jump and grab ledge mechanic is so slow and terribly inconsistent (needs fixing badly).  While hanging from a ledge my natural instinct is to hit the jump to jump up\, but no you have to push grab button again (why?).   If you are new to Fromsoft games\, you actually might be better equipped than longtime players\, but you will likely lose interest after the 50th death to the same early bosses.  If you are determined you will persevere or have a lucky run (even the blind hog finds an acorn except with a lot of skill needed even to get lucky).

Sekiro is From Software's most divisive game yet\, but also its most focused. It delivers on everything it sets out to do. It innovates while remaining loyal to its roots and thats hard to achieve. Its also the most cohesive game from japanese developer in terms of its story. Hundreds of wiki pages are this time not required to understand the plot. Most RPG elements are thrown out of the window in favor of fast paced action and skill. I know everyone expected Dark Souls clone\, but this aint that.

If the industry could use a shot of anything right now it's how to do more of this.My only criticism is also unfortunately necessary for Sekiro to work. This is a tale\, so character building and customization is pretty light\, and I've always liked those options in previous FromSoft titles.

Some people like tackling a boss with as few levels as possible. This doesn't exist in Sekiro. There is no underleveled or overleveled. Each boss is a challenge that must be defeated by skill alone. And maybe that's what people find frustrating - to lose means you weren't good enough. The progression in Sekiro isn't in the form of levels\, but your own physical skill. Your own strength\, and not your character's strength\, is what brings you victory. And to me\, this brings me greater satisfaction than any other game I've played.There's a a major misconception about combat. This game isn't about having god-like reflexes. Every enemy gives you ample time to react. It's about learning to read your opponent. Each attack has an appropriate counter. You see the opponent's tell\, and you respond accordingly\, requiring unforgiving but precise timing. More than pure reaction time\, it's about identifying the opponent's next move so you can counter it.  Know the enemy and know yourself.However its virtues\, the game isn't without flaws. The miniboss reskins are repetitive\, and there aren't a great many number of bosses. Getting each of the 4 endings becomes a chore rather than an enjoyable experience. Once you've platted the game\, there's little reason to continue playing unless you're attempting a charmless and/or demon bell run. After the first playthrough\, breezing through each boss shows you just how much you've improved\, but each subsequent playthrough loses the thrill of beating each boss for the first time.Yet despite its flaws\, I've never had a more profound dopamine rush playing a single player game. I'm torn between 9 and 10. This game is probably the best game I've ever played\, and yet even if it is\, can a game with such glaring flaws be a 10? Does an imperfect 10 exist?… Expand"

I just put it away and played something else\, disappointed that I wasted my money on such an overhyped product\, after my journey from Demon Souls all the way back in the PS3 era up to finishing Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne\, I felt the itch for a new game from this company was not scratched. I was so disappointed.

I devoured this game. Didn't play anything else for weeks. Every waking moment was spent thinking on how best to approach a new area\, a new enemy\, how to get through them with perfect parrys and no damage.The bosses\, the environments\, the music.

From Software's Sekiro shows why it was going to be a Tenchu game.  It's lineage is undeniable but this is the most hardcore Tenchu game you've ever played.  It's without a doubt easier and harder than their previous souls series.  The general enemies are easier then they have ever been because you can stealth kill everybody in the level if you so choose.  But then the mini bosses and actual bosses come along...They aren't the most difficult bosses but they are very challenging and there are very few options to power up and brute force your way through a boss.  You can farm xp and money to buy new skills and other things but you can't raise your base stats.  If you aren't sure of yourself or willing to improve you could hit a brick wall after a few hours and give up.If you can make it past the first mini boss and main boss then you are set.  When going through the game the path you are on may not be the lowest level/easiest way and there is no way to tell so if you get stuck just try a different path in the world.  This will help you gradually improve your character as you find beads in chests\, from vendors\, or from any mini bosses you manage to kill.These gives you extra HP and stamina to block with.  If you manage to kill any main boss you get a permanent damage boost.  You may also stumble across the more than a dozen weapons you can equip on your shinobi arm.  Find one that really makes you more comfortable when you play is a huge benefit.Combat is very responsive and nearly all the problems like phantom hits\, delayed actions after button presses\, and unresponsive controls from the souls series have been fixed.  On my 1080ti at 4k I get a solid 60fps on a mixture of High and Highest settings so the game runs well also much better than previous From games.Try not to get too angry when you sit back and enjoy ancient castles\, bamboo forests\, acid swamps\, mountain side temples\, forsaken villages\, and more in this gorgeous modern Tenchu game.  #gameoftheyear maybe… Expand"
