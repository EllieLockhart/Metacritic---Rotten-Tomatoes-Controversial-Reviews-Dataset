It brings to the table many great weird\, experimental\, and meaningful aspects of Japanese games that were popular in the NES to PS1 days. And unlike the original Gravity Rush\, this one actually finishes the story and gives a concrete ending.The game's story is a continuation of the original Gravity Rush game. It's not necessary to play the original game\, but if you're big on story continuity\, then it's a good idea to play Gravity Rush first.The setting is an incredibly strange and unique world\, which consists of various early 1900's-like societies existing on islands suspended in air. A pillar extends from the bottom to the top of this world and acts as the world's center. Inhabitants who live on one level of the pillar rarely interact with inhabitants on other levels due to the great distances (heights) and storms between them. This was unveiled in the previous game\, and this time around\, we get get much more information about how this world works and its relationship to its gods.The world setting is great\, with no huge writing-related issues. The biggest small issue with the believability of the world is the size of the societies. The societies seem way too small to support themselves. But it's easy to excuse that based on real-world development limitations.You play as Kat and Raven in this game\, gravity shifters who are primarily going about their daily lives. Gravity shifters are rare\, but don't really get special treatment by society.Like in the first game\, Kat starts out basically homeless and works as a miner. She's temporarily lost her gravity shifting abilities due to the events of the last game. If you do all of the side missions\, you'll spend much of your time doing mundane tasks (such as delivering mail\, catching dogs\, and moving furniture) in your amazing gravity-shifting ways. Kat has a great personality\, being kind\, trusting\, ready to do hard jobs\, sensitive of others' needs\, and calling out injustices when she sees them. It's simply great watching her interact with others in a variety of ways\, since the writing never demands her to be stupid to move the plot along. If you're a fan of the hard-working\, and intelligent young girls of the Atelier series\, such as Totori or Sophie\, you'll like Kat right away.Raven is a little different\, being seemingly older\, more jaded\, and more lazy. She doesn't add a whole lot to the story\, but what she does add is relatively important and good.While playing as Kat during the main story\, you'll primarily be dealing with the world's merchants and governments\, who aren't the most just organizations. They make relatively valid and easy-to-believe decisions about business or their territories which affect Kat\, her friends\, and sometimes society as a whole. You then take part in fights (not always literal) against them. While this might sound like we're getting into the territory of writing aimed at kids\, it doesn't ever get that bad. The motivations of those involved are vague enough\, and not important enough to Kat's goals (to need to know the full details)\, to keep things relatively believable.And when all of that's over and the credits roll\, the game isn't over yet. Kat then goes on a journey to learn more about the world and its gods that end in a very beautifully-written conclusion. In a side-story for Raven\, she goes on a similar journey. While not as well-written overall as Kat's\, it has a similarly beautiful conclusion. Both of the protagonists make sacrifices\, and they do this without second thoughts or trying to explain this to the player. Like in the Nier games\, you see what happens\, and that's it. You must come to your own conclusions: the game doesn't tell you how to feel.So this is definitely one of the Japanese greats. If you can get over the wild gravity-control gameplay\, there's some beautiful writing here for you to experience and contemplate.… Expand",true

The world is absolutely stunning\, somewhere between the tropical fantasy of Final Fantasy XII and the skyward architecture of Bioshock Infinite\, the cities you inhabit feel truly alive\, bustling\, full of secrets and charm. Character design and music echoes this and the entire sensory package is a delight to experience. Seeing different districts of the city (upper\, middle and working class in the first\, then specific industrial districts in the second) is wonderful and each part of the game feels lived in and tangible. The story has strokes of genius (anti-corporation\, class division) but I ultimately lost interest towards the end and was actually pretty lost with what was actually going on as the narrative leaps around nonsensically. However\, the protagonist Kat is one of the most likable main characters I've experienced\, endlessly hopeful and optimistic in the face of truly awful humans and situations. Why have Sony not promoted her more as a mascot? She is a fantastic role model!The movement control scheme is wonderful and I never tired of flying around cities\, collecting gems and experimenting with each of the gravity styles (Terran\, Lunar and Jovian). Choosing a point to redirect your character's gravity pull towards is genius and all the additional add-ons like sliding\, super jumps\, catapults and wall-walks make it even better. You'll frequently get distracted for half an hour at a time just wandering round the HUGE maps\, seeing what lies around (and beneath) every floating island. Unfortunately\, combat is a whole different ball game. Frequently frustrating\, unwieldy and hampered hugely by the camera\, battling is truly a huge annoyance more than anything and considering the game lends itself to being a fun\, exciting platformer/collectathon at heart\, combat is featured WAY too heavily. The overall effect means that I look back on the game much more negatively than I'd like\, as I honestly hated any fights. Even basic enemies are a pain sometimes as you try to kick them\, fly 50m out their reach\, lose track of the camera and then get smashed with an attack. Boss battles against flying enemies are insanely frustrating. There's a lot of variety to combat but often it just does not work well. Furthermore\, side quests are often quite dull and ridiculously long - often as long as story missions. The game drags out menial tasks to odd lengths and the momentum of the game is truly lost. I ended up forgoing side quests entirely til the end of the game.In summary\, I wish Gravity Rush 2 was simply an exploration game with difficult platforming and a more chilled approach to missions\, with shorted side quests and waaaaaayyy less combat. The style and brains behind the game cannot be faulted\, it's truly amazing to see. But playing through it becomes a slog and detracts from the game's true charm. Regardless\, Kat should be championed as a huge Sony mascot from now on - make Gravity Rush 3\, sort the issues and make her a star!… Expand",true

In one moment you face the hard reality of capitalism and in another you fight fantastic beasts or fly around in dreamy environments. A big plus is that everything comes together in the end and comes to a proper closure...although i wish to see a sequels :)+ Gameplay - gameplay is basically the same as in the first game but on steroids...on some really good steroids. You now have 3 different gravity styles - normal\, light and heavy plus a special one which i won't spoil. It takes time to master those\, but once you get a feel on when to use which style\, it's really satisfying to fight enemies.  Additionally to the standard upgrade system you can find also talismans that allow you to boost your powers. There's a also a light crafting system where you can combine talismans to improve their traits. Bottom line: gameplay is fun AF.+ Soundtrack - great music  fitted well to the mood and environments in the game+ Physics - game uses hawok and if you use stasis or shift gravity\, thinks are flying around like crazy\, stuff is breaked\, it just looks very coolNow for the neutral/negative stuff:- Camera - camera is sometimes confused. It's better than in the first game\, but remember you are shifting gravity and falling\, not flying. So it's pretty much random and you can end up in awkward angles. Not a very common problem\, but it happens from time to time- Some missions - stealth mission are not the greatest. It's a nice change of pace\, but sometimes annoying. It's like someone give you a Lamborghini and forces you to go 30Mph. But i get the point of the developers..change of pace.- Side missions - some side missions are silly and you get silly rewards. It would be nice if the game told me upfront what the reward is. Again..i know what the developers were thinking\, Kat is not doing it for the reward. She's just a good girl.So overall a really awesome game. I believe it's not for everyone. Japanese games are very specific. If you're not sure\, just get the first game for 10$. If you like it\, you will like this one as well.… Expand",true

It deserves to stand next to it’s critically acclaimed peers proudly when it comes to Playstation exclusives. This game is AMAZING\, PHENOMENAL\, SUPERB\, and SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS.The one big reason is because of the lead protagonist\, Kat. Kat is funny\, charming\, spunky\, and an absolute blast to be around. Her infinite enthusiasm mixed with her passion to help others makes her oh so lovable. But it’s not all just about Kat. There’s an amazing story as well. The story stays engrossing from beginning to end because of how Kat deals with the situations she’s thrusted into\, the mystery behind her past\, and the sheer amount of surprises and shocks that pop up. Just when you think you know what’s going on or what will happen\, the story steers you in one direction then it switches direction then makes you go inverted then flips you horizontally then throws you off a building then captures you then throws you again and.....in shorter words\, the story flips the atmosphere’s gravity just when things feel predictable. With a story comes a supporting cast and the cast is great. The new and returning characters are all likable and manage to help the story move forward. Then there’s the well written dialogue. When it’s time to be serious\, the dialogue is compelling and when it’s time to be silly\, the dialogue is humorous and playful. There’s a good balance of seriousness and comedy. And finally the story’s conclusion\, there’s enough closure and answers to everything we’ve wondered since Gravity Rush 1. It is an epic\, heart breaking\, heart warming\, and terrific end to this fantastic series.On the gameplay side\, Gravity Rush 2 excels in providing a creative and unique gravity system that helps Kat travel from place to place and vanquish her enemies.Traversing the world via walking is definitely nice to do but the real fun comes from zooming from one place to another with gravity. Using Kat’s abilities to fly high into the sky and fall from the sky is an absolute delight. Kat can also walk on the surfaces of many environments with her powers. This time around Jirga Para Lhao will be Kat’s playground. Jirga Para Lhao has many areas to travel\, people to see\, conversations to be had\, precious gems to find\, challenges to beat\, and many side quests to do. It’s huge and brimming with all types of people. When it comes to the Story and Side Missions\, they aren’t repetitive. If a mission shares a common game structure\, it tends to be spread out\, making the missions feel constantly fresh. The creativity really shines when it comes to the Side Missions. Gravity Rush 2 spins and flips typical mission objectives and does something new with them. Throughout your journey\, you’ll be fighting many types of enemies. The combat from the previous entry returns and feels tighter. Kat’s stylized combo kicks and punches are back\, as well as her gravity kicking and gravity dash. Returning also is the stasis field which is very useful in picking up enemies and objects and throwing them at your targets. Many of the story battles are insane due to the scale and scope they reach. It’s breathtaking to be apart of it.The cel-shaded visuals that help create Gravity Rush’s gorgeous art style is back and looks stunning on the PS4. The 2D and 3D character models for every character looks splendid  because of it and so does the world. Jirga Para Lhao is designed beautifully and sprawling with life. Merchants are calling out for you to buy their products\, entertainers are providing amusement to passerbyers\, civilians are conversing\, life is just happening\, oh yeah and everyone is reacting to my gravitational destruction. The comic panel cutscenes and the character portrait cutscenes look better than ever because of higher quality art\, entertaining text bubbles\, and sound effects. But the true star is the cinematic cutscenes which don’t last too long\, but they are marvelous when presented. The animation is superb and the cinematography is glorious.Alongside the awe-inspiring visuals\, is the outstanding music score. Battles come alive with the fierce and stimulating music and each distinct area has their own song that creates a unique atmosphere.With all the praise said\, I have to mention the flaws. For example: A few missions are frustrating due to how they’re designed\, there are some annoying respawns\, the camera can get super crazy\, especially during battles\, and there are reused character portraits and models.Overall\, Gravity Rush 2 is like I said at the top\, “AMAZING\, PHENOMENAL\, SUPERB\, and SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS”. It’s not perfect but it’s nearly there. I’ll tell you what it is though\, it’s an UNDERRATED PRECIOUS GEM AND IT’S ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER! SUPER CREATIVE AND UNIQUE! i LOOOOOVE GRAVITY RUSH 2 AND KAT!TL;DR: NO! You better go back up to the top and read this thoroughly!… Expand",true

The environment focuses more on vertical building/island designs compared to most city-landscape-styled open world games which is quite refreshing. Only complaint is that the sky sometime feels kinda empty\, would've preferred if they plopped in some gems every once in a while to keep you engaged while flying.Story-wise\, it's nothing ground-breaking nor life-changing and it doesn't need to be\, it's just a simple plot to move the player forward.Gameplay\, as mentioned before\, a large selection of movement and combat options to get you through the game. The Normal Gravity Style is simple and what you'll be sticking to most in combat\, Lunar Style makes Kat lighter\, gains a teleporting kick and higher jumps but she falls slower and lastly Jupiter Style which makes Kat heavier\, punches with more force and an even faster falling/sliding speed (good for travelling long distances) at the small cost of walking really slow. Flipping to and from different styles mid-combat or exploration is the main focus of this sequel.Sound design\, MMMM\, quality soundtrack all around. Personal favorites are Night Gale (Raven's Theme)\, Pleasure Quarter (Pleajune) and the main theme - A Red Apple Fell from the Sky. Voice acting is overall great especially Kat.Difficulty\, the game as a whole isn't hard at all (aside from that one boss fight where Raven carried my sorry *ss). Every challenge you come across can be Gold Medalled on the first try especially if you equip the best talisman for the situation (compared to the first game\, the challenge missions here are a bit too easy for my liking). IF you are trying to get all achievements and 100% this game (and with the shutdown of the online servers this is no longer possible)\, have fun finding all the required photos and grinding for money. Nothing much to do post-game once you finish all the side quests unless you want to get all trophies and tackle the Delvool Mines (a floor-dungeon styled challenge that appears once a day and exists solely for players who want to challenge their skill at the game).Graphics\, putting this last on the list cuz I don't play a game for its graphics... but MY GOD THIS GAME IS BEAUTIFUL. I'm a big fan of cel shaded graphics and this game nails the aesthetic. The towns look beautiful and this game is not nominated \""Best Character Design\"" without a reason\, each character looks amazing. With the in-game camera that is given to you once you reach town\, you can take pictures anywhere and anytime... and that's exactly what I did all throughout the game (it was worth it). The screenshot function is way too limited but it gets the job done for its simplicity\, add filters\, play dress-up with Kat with the different outfits you unlock along the way and make her pose for that selfie in front of that mech that Raven is destroying in the background.I just want to add this at the end\, no spoilers but the final boss fight was...... BUILT UP FKING AMAZINGLY AND THE CREDITS AT THE END\, MMM SOOOO GOODtl;drPretty biased review since this quickly became one of my no. 1 favorite games.It's a great game\, far from perfect but unique in its own right and the best part - fun from start to finish.

The game's main characters are likeable\, especially the protagonist duo of Kat and Raven who behave like two young girls but with super powers. Combat is simple and intuitive\, but it can get repetitive. Along the way you empower your abilities and are granted two different play styles as the story unfolds. Other than the normal style\, Lunar style makes you lighter and Jupiter style makes you heavier\, each affecting you in differing ways. And let's not forget the physics on display when you unleash your powers on the enemies and debris go flying all over\, they are on a whole new level than the 1st game.The cel-shaded graphics are beautiful and the manga-style storytelling is unique and charming. The open world is yours to explore and take on story missions\, side quests and challenges. The game's story is presented in a 4 chapter (27 episodes) structure with one fake ending in the 3rd chapter and the true ending if you beat the 4th chapter. Kat's true identity and tragic past are revealed in the final chapter\, and after a slow start it's non-stop action leading to a great finale. And if all that wasn't enough\, the game's got a free prequel story expansion centering on Raven\, called Another Story: The Ark of Time – Raven's Choice\, lasting 6 episodes (3 hours of gameplay\, more or less). The game's even got a nice instrumental-based soundtrack that perfectly fits the mood.Now comes the negative part. Some of the stealth missions (both main and side ones) are awfully designed and unforgiving due to not having coherent and clear stealth rules. Furthermore\, like the 1st game\, near the story's end there is a series of 3D gravity shifting puzzle levels which I found really annoying and offputting. Last but not least\, the aerial combat and the camera during combat can be troublesome. When performing aerial kicks there is a chance you 'll miss your kicks (especially in standard style\, so go for the lunar one)\, and you have to manually align the camera quite often when enemies are attacking you from all directions. A future Gravity Rush game will require a reworked camera and combat system.In the end Gravity Rush 2 is a beautiful and charming game from Sony's acclaimed Studio Japan. I 'd like to see a sequel in the future\, the game's director says he 'd like to do it\, but that's all we got for now. It's a nice curio that will please fans of japanese games. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to every PS4 gamer.… Expand",true

Not far into it\, you are introduced to a wide open area that is very nicely designed. Unfortunately\, it is stripped away from you while progressing the story. You're then thrusted into the map from Gravity Rush 1. Which is nice\, but not nearly as nice to look at as the earlier map.If you choose to push through the story missions\, it will take about 30 hours to complete. I do not suggest playing this only for the story. It's broken up into 3 disjointed storylines. The endings of which are pretty lackluster. That's without going into the details on just how infuriating the missions become later on. Bosses eventually become a matter of luck\, scrambling for healing items on the map and mashing the attack button.Between major story events\, the game tosses in these very out of place linear challenge missions. They are all graphical oddities which are super lazy in presentation and the challenges themselves range from easy to cheap and exhausting.That being said\, there is more good to go around here. There are plenty of side quests to do which carry a lot of charm. My only gripe with them is there is a bit too much of the \""go here\, then go here\"" sort of work however.All in all. This game is a mixed bag by definition. Certain elements are so poorly designed and inconsistent you wonder how they got into an otherwise great game. I can only assume the design process was very disjointed. There's a lot of potential in this franchise\, but I just don't see it reaching it.

Boss fights are broken and irritating\, flying around is often confusing and buggy\, the storylines really aren't that good\, but I can't help but love this series because the characters and the artstyle are so good that they overshadow all the downfalls of the series combined. Kinda. Unlike the first game\, the artstyle has gravitated (I'm sorry) towards a cartoony feeling rather than the moody and dark theme that the first game had\, and honestly\, it feels pretty refreshing. Though\, I have a major complaint. The game often feels a bit... empty.The people don't feel like people. They just feel like they're NPCs and nothing else\, which they are\, but it feels like it's emphasized more in Gravity Rush 2 rather than the first one. And yes\, the world is bigger\, but that makes it so half the game\, you just fly to missions\, and it's a shame\, because I still do love the game. You can feel the passion of the developers shining throughout the game\, and that makes it a relatively worthwhile experience. Although I don't wanna bash the game\, there are many things that were just left unexplained. For example\, where the hell did the Nevi come from? Seriously\, there's no backstory to them\, and their only known purpose is to get in your way. All these gravity storms and things like that; they're never explained\, so the foundation of the entire game feels a bit shaky and unstable. The game felt as it started very fast but also very slow at the same time. Like\, you spend about 40 or so minutes just mining and mining and it gets a bit tedious\, and Mirai\, the dude who was really mean to you in the first 5 minutes of the game\, really predictably grows to like you. Then\, you just kinda do random **** for like another hour and then the game finally gets going. I'm fine with the beginning's length\, but I wish it'd be a bit more filled with fun things to do. Also\, although I'm glad that it moved on (a bit) from the last game in terms of all the missions being fighting the Nevi and nothing else\, it feels like that was replaced with flying around\, and I don't know about you\, but that's even more boring than fighting the Nevi. I honestly really want to say that I absolutely love the game and that I give it a 10/10\, but its flaws feel like they're crushing the experience that I wanna have... But God\, Kat is the perfect main character. She has all the personality traits that the makes her a really fun character\, and she's one of the reasons why I still love the game.I'm feeling a bit conflicted to give it such a score\, but overall\, I'd give the game a 6.5 out of 10.… Expand",true

Also despite being great to explore\, the 4 main areas are too vertically distant\, and unless you use the fast travel it takes way too much to get from one to another\, which isn't great because I would prefer to use the gravity shift.… Expand",true
95178,GR2,2018-10-20,6,"Much like its predecessor\, Gravity Rush 2 suffers from an infuriating and at times downright awful camera\, with which you’ll be fighting throughout the whole game. It doesn’t help that the game likes to throw around extremely boring -and clearly not well thought out- stealth missions and worst of all\, PLATFORMING missions.

It doesn’t help that the game likes to throw around extremely boring -and clearly not well thought out- stealth missions and worst of all\, PLATFORMING missions. If you can somehow get past the terrifying controls\, you’ll find what’s essentially “Fetch Quests: The Game”\, and unfortunately\, this holds true for both side quests and main quests. You’ll soon find that you are pretty much repeating the same tasks over and over\, with the rare exception of some decently crafted boss fights (more aesthetically than gameplay wise).In Gravity rush 2\, Kat is still the same boring and underdeveloped character we’ve come to know from the first game\, and if you were hoping you’d get to see more of her or her story\, prepare to be disappointed up until the very end of the game (if you’ll have the patience to get there\, that is).This game’s only saving grace lies in its art direction. At times\, it can look absolutely gorgeous\, and even when it doesn’t look as good\, it still holds its charm. Not to mention the fantastic soundtrack\, which in and of itself is worth half the price of the game.To sum it up\, Gravity Rush 2 manages to be twice as big as the first one\, and at the same time twice as boring. Whether this game is worth your time or not\, depends on how much you liked the first game\, and how invested you are in its -unfortunately extremely underdeveloped- universe. If you can get past the repetitiveness\, the horrible camera and the bland story\, you’ll most likely find some enjoyment in Gravity Rush 2.… Expand",true

It was really fun to play\, heart warming\, with a good sound track and lots of content to play.All the costumes for Kat were really cute\, and the hottest ones were 2B\, Crazy Cat\, Black Cat and Jazz Singer. The Nurse one was the cutest one. Being able to take upskirt pictures of Kat was awesome\, my most sincere thanks to the developers.\n\nThe gameThis game was great\, I just love it.

The Nurse one was the cutest one. Being able to take upskirt pictures of Kat was awesome\, my most sincere thanks to the developers.The game mechanics are the same as in the previous game\, fall\, lock up\, kick; unfortunately trying to lock up on enemies while floating around is really hard\, and it can become really annoying if you're trying to do it while falling.Some of the challenges at the beginning are really hard\, compared to the first game where the challenges were a piece of cake\, here they are really tough and there’s no way to finish them until at least you have maxed out some of your skills\, which is impossible not unless you have finished the game.As mentioned before the OST is one of the good features of this game\, I loved all and each one of the tracks\, they were really sticky\, and the “Apple” song was the best.The DLC was ok\, it tried somehow to conclude some parts of the main story but honestly it left me with more questions than answers.Anyway\, I spent lots of hours playing this game and I had lots of fun\, it kinda made me sad that I finished it.

Y no me meto mas para no dar spoilers aunque ganas no me faltanConserva un estilo grafico genial y ahora con mas variedad lo mismo con la banda sonora pero ahora en PS4 se le puede sacar mas provecho a ambos apartados.Un juego opacado en su lanzamiento al estar a lado de obras de renombre y otros juegos con mas marketing pero definitivamente una obra de calidad superior y mi GOTY 2017… Expand",false
