The game doesn't have a high skill ceiling or anything (as it shouldnt since its a singleplayer game) but u can easily identify an experienced player from a beginner\, furthermore the fact it has 3 playstyles (4 if you find the hidden one) that can be switched to at any time adds a lot of depth and stratagy to the combat which wasnt in the series before this game. Grabbing thing from the environment to beat the **** out of people with is really fun and so are heat actions.

This game also has the most memorable and most fun bosses in the series along with Kiwami\, atleast for me. Even though I personally like kiryus playstyles more than those of Majima\, majimas playstyles are still great but they take more getting used to than those of kiryu and therefore\, at first feel less satisfying as a result. As expected in a yakuza game the side stuff here is well made and entertaining. I love the aesthetic and the setting. The story here is great but its a pain to skip on repeat playthroughs due to the fact there is a lot of dialogue\, this results in a game that isn't as replayable as kiwami and kiwami 2\, which have stories that are easier to skip\, but its still very replayable. along with this skipping the story results in bad pacing unlike some other games in the series where it still retains good pacing if the story is skipped. There are also a couple of tedious escort missions that are just not fun and the game is lacking when it comes to beat em up stages when you consider how long it is\, it has roughly the same amount as kiwami but kiwami is a much shorter game so u would expect 0 to have more. There are also a lot of parts where you're stuck trying to find where you need to go next\, these parts are really unfun for me.

It shows the beginnings of the later Legends Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Maijima within a genuine and compelling story. I will praise the developers for the story and the well implemented characters. The main story is about a huge governmental founded construction project in Tokyo where the planing phase is nearly finished when it is discovered that a small piece of estate (The empty lot) is not purchased and the owner is nowhere to be found. This can stop the project so the small piece of estate is worth hundreds of millions if not billions of Yen. Now the struggle for power and money begins as the Yakuza and others want use this opportunity for their gains. All characters are connected somewhere to this or get dragged into and of cause there is a lot more to it than you think. The game starts with the story of Kiryu for 2 chapters\, then switches to Maijima and later back and forth between them. At first you are puzzled how the stories are connected but with each twist new pieces of the puzzle are connected and unfold an incredible story with a satisfying conclusion. Be warned! There will be sad revelations and victims. Destiny has often a cruel hand. For the characters: Kiryu is the stoic archetype of a hero who has his code of honor and while he will struggle will not fall or falter to do what is right. Goro Maijima is the complete opposite from the other games. This should anger fans but his story arc and development is so believable and natural that no one can complain. Then there are the higher ups in the Dojima family. Each one is in competition against each other. There is Daisuke Kuze while he is the oldest guy is still a formidable adversary and gave one advice that can be used in real live: As long as you can stand up (again) and continue you are not truly beaten”. Then there is Hiroki Awano which is a master of persuation (He will make offers you cant refuse;-). The last of the three lieutenants is Keji Shibusawa\, he is the man of few words who works behind the scenes and the person you should always be paying attention. The patriarch Sohei Dojima is a schemer and plotter which uses the lever of competition on his lieutenants and stays behind to avoid troubles. He was only a plot device in Yakuza 1 and they gave him a lot of personality here. There is also the friendship / brotherly relation between Kiryu and Akira Nishikiyama. This is a welcome backstory addition as it makes the story of Yakuza 1 deeper (Wont spoil). For the others: Tetsu Tachibana is a force to be recognized and with Makoto Miura one of the best additions this game makes to the franchise (Cant spoil). There is also the story of Tsukasa Sagawa who is an interesting character and schemer with lot of connections who is holding Maijimas string. At last there is Jun Oda the right hand of Tachibana. He has made a past mistake that haunts his live. Lets talk about the greatest strength of the Yakuza games: The side activities / quest. While the games are probably the smallest open world games they are filled to the brim. You've got a lot of side quest which gave you money items or unlock characters for other mini games. They have arcade games of the Sega classics Outrun\, Super Hang On\, Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone. You can play Poker\, Blackjack\, Roulette\, Bowling\, Pool\, Darts\, Shogi\, Mahjong\, Koi-Koi and Cho Han (I am probably forgetting some activities). You can bet on Cat Fights (No not animals)\, participate in Pocket Racing\, try to get Home-runs at the battering center or play a fishing mini game. There is of cause an Underground fighting arena and a Boss walking on the streets you can fight for insane amounts of money. You lose all your money if you lost except you have the right item then you lose only a big amount. The boss gets stronger after each defeat. Two side activities have their own story arc and an awesome reward for completing (Both are also a good source for money).  There is the real estate business for Kiryu. Where you try to beat the leaders of the districts and their shady businesses. You do this by acquirement and development of real estate objects until you became the top dog in the district which leads to a boss fight. My favorite is the Cabaret Club Management for Maijima. You become the manager of a club and try to compete with the other higher ranked clubs. You recruit\, train and outfit your team. The mechanics are easy to learn with some depth. The battle system is also really good. You will get 3 styles and eventually unlock an ultimate style. All styles can be upgraded and you can unlock new attacks / moves. This gives you a good amount of variety. I want also mention the cameos. Because its the eighties you will met Steven Spielberg\, Michael Jackson and Vladimir Putin (Last one is not named but I will bet money that's really him).

Just like JRPGs there are random encounters with enemies in the open map. Brawls are melee fights\, the fighting system is deep and varied\, you can choose from 3 different fighting styles (tank\, fighter\, rogue)\, withYakuza 0 is a great entry in the series\, but can't top the masterful Yakuza Kiwami.The Yakuza series has always been JRPGs at heart\, with battles playing out as brawls. Just like JRPGs there are random encounters with enemies in the open map. Brawls are melee fights\, the fighting system is deep and varied\, you can choose from 3 different fighting styles (tank\, fighter\, rogue)\, with some excellent high-level finishers having to be unlocked first.Yakuza 0 is set in 1988 Japan\, with the country's economic bubble about to burst. The story is about 2 protagonists (series regular Kiryu Kazuma\, and newly added Goro Majima) being involved in an internal Yakuza power struggle\, both of them trying to survive. Lead characters are very likeable and develop during the story's length.The campaign can last dozens of hours\, but not all of them are quality time. That's because of the inclusion of 2 time-consuming mini-campaigns\, one for each protagonist. Kiryu Kazuma's real estate and Goro Majima's hostess club business should have been a 1-2 hours affair to see through\, but they each last more than 10 hours to complete\, so you are basically looking at a 20-hour-long grinding. These activities are optional but you can't really avoid them and focus on the main story\, or else you won't be able to upgrade your heroes past a certain point\, and you will need those upgrades especially in the higher difficulties.The game is also full of side quests. These are either small fetch quests or just a quick story unfolding before you in a matter of minutes\, but the writing is usually top notch. Plenty of comical stories but also some dramatic ones. A standout for me was the couple of quests paying tribute to the late Michael Jackson\, complete with his moonwalk and dancing.Last but not least\, there are tons of mini games\, from darts and billiards to bowling and karaoke\, even Sega's old Outrun arcade game.Not everything is rosy though. The game's map of Kamurocho is identical to the version included in other Yakuza games. If you play a couple of Yakuza games it can become tiresome to see Kamurocho again. Then there is the issue with the camera. Because the map is tightly packed (typical of Japan) the camera can't easily follow your hero when walking in narrow corridors or building interiors. It should have been an over-the-shoulder type of camera. But these are all my gripes.On the technical side\, Yakuza 0 runs at 60 fps just like Yakuza Kiwami\, frame rates drops only in a couple of heavy scenes with dozens of enemies on-screen. The OST is nice\, with a few standout rock tracks. Voice overs are in japanese\, there is no option for english dubs\, but you get used to that.Overall\, Yakuza 0 is a great game\, even though it's not perfect. Yakuza Kiwami is a better game and a more suitable introduction to the series. If you play the 1st game and you like it\, then proceed to Yakuza 0 and the other entries.… Expand",true

That's the greatness of this game; it soars above so many modern titles for keeping the core foundation of satisfying gameplay\, great stories ripped right out of action and mafia films with its own originality\, metric tons of activities (all surprisingly fun to do) and so much respect for its players that even for $60 this is highway robbery and would have been assaulted by most game companies in the worst of ways. Thankfully\, this is a 2 games (you could even argue 3) in 1 that is absolutely worth your time. Let me briefly explain the game more to not mislead.Story - Arguably one of the best\, well-written\, solid voicework and mature tone to a game I have not seen this strong in a long time. While some can argue the dissonant tone of the game might take wind out of its sails\, the balancing of this tone is so well executed that it blows my mind. The plot is a bit lengthy and definitely full of dialogue\, but watching it was engrossing. The ending went on longer than I expected and even after all of what happen I felt I only scratched the surface of this series.Characters - What a hell of a character list. Kazama Kiryu and Majima Goro (the latter in particular) present a air of realism\, stoicism\, grit and gusto that had me sold after the first chapters they appear in. The other characters of the different families and clans all had complex and deep personas that oozed curiosity. For a game mirroring action and mafia films this was a kickass cast of people. Well done voice acting as well.Combat - Satisfying\, but I would not call it outstanding overall. It has issues in most of its abilities (even some of the styles themselves) being weak additions and not worth the investment. The repetition can set in after awhile and for those wanting a deeper system you wont find that here. This is more of a old school beatem up (with absolutely amazing if not insane finishers and heat action moves) that carries problems as a result. Regardless\, this serves its part and at least keeps me interested. The fourth weapon slot is forgettable and the use of handguns by enemies can be a pain to deal with. Bosses are not really different from normal enemies and easy to abuse\, but the QTE events make them memorable and stand out alot.Minigames - So many of them\, ranging from blackjack to soft core porn videos\, karaoke to shogi\, this game has it all and it serves the point of \""just because you have to be yakuza serious\, doesnt mean you cant have yakuza fun\"". Add to that a real estate and club management and this alone could be its own game on some mobile free stuff. I absolutely loved it all.Substories/Challenges: Completing these were overall good with some memorable and well written pieces that had me laughing one minute and sobbing the next. The objectives themselves might be simple or fetchy\, but the writing to them is great and is able to keep that dissonant tone consistent throughout with no real sign of weakness. Then you have challenges that test your abilities and skills to learn new moves with a ton to offer you.I feel almost insulting this game for not talking more about it\, but it is one of those games that is better to play and roll with its crappy initial impression than to have someone fully explain it. I would like to add a few more things to it: the music is well done and memorable\, the crafting system is weak\, new game plus\, free mode and other options to play with another player is insane. Playing over 50+ hours felt like the first course and based on how much more I would still have to do\, this would easily be a 100+ hour game to 100% complete\, with a exciting energy to it that makes me smile ear to ear.As a newcomer to the series\, I was initially skeptical but now I consider Yakuza 0 to be a colossal achievement for what it wants to accomplish and feel inclined to play the remasters and the future Yakuza 6. This game is a action packed treat and if you have a PS4 this is an absolute buy\, no questions asked. Despite its outdated nature\, the beating heart of nostalgia gaming of Yakuza 0 burns as passionately as Kiryu and Majima's spirits and is an excellent game for anyone to play.… Expand",true

Yet after I saw a trusted YouTuber review this game\, I began to dive into the game history and lore before deciding to give it a try.Yakuza 0 is a game that takes itself seriously\, while at the same time.... doesn't. It's this odd blend of storytelling\, character switching\, stereotyping and vintage landscape that gives this title so much character. Playing as two seemingly unrelated protagonists\, you will find yourself going \""why am I doing this?\"" only to say \""I'm so glad I did that!\"" As storylines meld and the full reveal rears its face\, you'll find comedy\, tragedy\, heart warming stories and vile acts of society all neaty packaged into a game that's sitting at your fingertips.I won't pull any punches graphically. This game shows why its a \""remaster\"" of a PS3 release. It's not going to blow you away visually. It's not going to wow you with its environment. At times\, you might even groan at the camera angle. However\, Yakuza 0 is one of those games that makes up for it's graphical shortcomings through storytelling and immersion.  How? Here's how!There are so many side quests and mini games built into this title\, they could have pay walled each of them off and sold them separately. Vintage Sega arcade games\, Bikini girls wrestling\, Mahjong\, fishing\, slot car racing\, the back door casino room\, the phone dating service game\, collecting cards that unlock video pretty women casually posing for the camera\, batting cages\, the Hostess Club sim (which makes you lots of cash)\, dancing at the club\, and karaoke are just some of the activities you can partake in when you're not buying up businesses\, beating up thugs or doing various side quests.This game isn't a true open world experience and to be honest\, that's okay. Once you get a sense of the story\, you begin to identify when you should explore and when you're likely going to be confined into a story arc. While some people want that \""always open\, always free\"" feel\, you'll likely find yourself to engrossed in the story to care or too busy making money to notice.Perhaps one of the strongest downsides to the game IS you need to make money. As the game progresses\, abilities\, your character durability and importantly\, the ability to survive hinge on you making money.  While thousand yen bills are easy to come buy\, true to the 80s theme\, inflation is a huge problem. Thus\, you'll quickly drop 30 million Yen on a single skill and sent to the streets looking for more. Luckily\, if you grab the Hostess Club and Property Owner side quest / mini games when they're presented and run with them\, you'll soon find yourself at an advantage.Overall\, this is a solid title and one of those diamonds in the rough. Though far from polished in a sea of AAA titles praised for graphical perfection and stunning environments\, Yakuza 0 shows what a title can do when you mix fun\, story and solid gameplay together while still maintaining a sense of humor.… Expand",true

Kiryu's level tree is a bit pointless at times as some of the fighting styles other than his default are boring and clunky and there is no incentive to level up them up.The is the only bad point I have about this game and now the franchise\, the combat is getting stale they need to start making the AI smarter and having a more skilled approach to combat\, somewhere between a tactical fighter like Bloodborne/dark souls with more rpg elements and what it is now would be the best thing ever for this series. There are no real consequences to fighting poorly or well\, you just loose more health and have to use more consumables. As it stands you can almost just mash the hits buttons and pretty much win every fight without thinking.

This game contains several great mini games and some are super fun\, such as Cabaret Club\, Real estate business. Seriously I spent 60 hours+ into the game\, more than half are from mini games and side quests. It is safe to say that Yakuza is one of the best games in term of making mini games as well.Combat system is good\, not the best though. It is more like Street fighter in 3 dimensions\, rather than other action games like Batman. The way enemies attacking you is kind of random\, but it is still fun nonetheless. There are many cool animations when you use heat gauge\, especially with new environment or equipment. It is subjective one but those who like fighting should like this one as well.Next is cutscenes. There are many cutscenes here. and again ONE OF THE BEST CUTSCENES game I ever saw in my 20 years gamer. Facial expressions look so real\, they thrill me every time. Voice acting is top notch too.One last thing I have to mention is the soundtracks. This game has ones of THE BEST SOUNDTRACKS ever.

Combat is good too but it is subjective one. Game length is long. No negative comes to my mind at all. Definitely deserves my 10/10 score.

It's full of brawling\, honor\, respect\, patriarchies\, gentlemanliness\, and just an all-around good portrayal of male natural instincts. Women have their place in the game too\, but they don't directly compete with the very brutal (and realistically portrayed) nature of men.Besides that\, it's a pretty darn good game too. I'll get into the gameplay aspects first.There's a lot to do in the game. I previously played Yakuza Kiwami and this game has roughly twice as much stuff to do. I spent 90 hours in this one compared to about 45 in Kiwami. There's more than 20 minigames\, although most of them are gambling-based. The top two minigames are real estate management and cabaret club management. Both very different\, but fun\, addictive\, and time-consuming in their own ways. And if you're a typical man like me\, you'll also spend a lot of time doing the phone club mini game\, where you talk to random girls on the phone until you convince one to go on a date with you\, sometimes with unexpected outcomes. And then there's the gravure video collecting and phone card collecting (both featuring partially nude girls).Like Kiwami\, the side quests are all interesting. They range from relatively normal to off-the-wall bonkers. A big part of why they're so appealing is that you're a masculine Yakuza (mafia) type\, yet you partake in activities that are more appropriate for children\, nerds\, or anyone besides a Yakuza-type. This is the selling point of the game for me. This clash of expectations and the character's in-game reactions to you taking part in these is hilarious.The main story is what sets the tone or seriousness of your character\, to contrast the side quests and minigames. There's no comedy here. It's all serious\, all of the time\, and that's a good thing. Without going into detail on the plot\, the story is good\, good enough to be a TV or movie crime drama\, which is better than what most video games do these days. It has a number of minor plot holes and video-game conveniences\, but will satisfy most as long as you're not expecting a literary masterpiece.The biggest plot hole is your protagonists' fists. You'll frequently be put into the position where the big bad guy will leave and send his 50 goons after you. But miraculously\, you will be able to fight them all off. You do this so many times\, that you might start to wonder if the big bad guys are taking you seriously and if you're actually Superman. Though this is common in many video games\, so it probably won't bother most.As a side note\, the game supposedly takes place in the 1980's\, but many of the advertisements in-game don't indicate this. Most are seemingly identical as in Kiwami (which takes place in a different decade). It's just a little disappointing to see 2000's style glamour advertisements in a game that's supposed to take place two decades prior.And finally\, the game supposedly shows us how Majima Goro became the crazy person he is\, but it doesn't do that very well. For most of the game\, he acts basically like the other protagonist\, and then all of a sudden at the end\, he turns crazy. It would have been better if they just left out the crazy bit so fans could continue to guess how he went crazy\, but there you go: we got the reason\, even if it isn't a very good one.This is a good one and I'm looking forward to playing the remakes of the other games in the series.… Expand",true

Boy was I wrong. I know how this sounds but a big reason that I don’t like Japanese RPG’S or just Japanese games in general is because I like games that are grounded in a little more reality. This game is really weirdYakuza 0 is probably going to be my pleasant surprise of the year. I had heard of this series and I did hear that it was a good game but I didn’t think that I would like it. Boy was I wrong. I know how this sounds but a big reason that I don’t like Japanese RPG’S or just Japanese games in general is because I like games that are grounded in a little more reality. This game is really weird but finds a way to stay grounded and I think that’s why I liked it so much.Initially\, I was not loving the story but the combat was fun enough that I stuck with it. As the game went along\, I started getting more and more into the story. I really liked the breakdown of the game and especially where there was 2 protagonists (Kiryu and Majima). Every 2 chapters you would switch between these characters. It was kind of interesting watching these 2 characters back stories and then eventually the two stories started to become intertwined with one another. By the end\, I found it all to be very interesting and my favorite part of the game wound up being the story.The games combat was broken into 6 different types and both of the protagonists had 3 each. I ended up liking Majima’s combat more because it had my 2 favorite combat battle styles. The first one that I liked was called the “Breaker Style” which was break dancing in fighting form. You would do all of these break dancing moves and they would count as attacks against the enemies. It was kind of stupid but fun to do. Although I really liked the “Breaker Style\,” my go-to was “Slugger Style” which was where he had a baseball bat. I ultimately liked this style the best because it was very effective and I had the most success with it.The game isn’t just story and combat\, its a whole open world with a ton of things to do. You can play baseball\, you can go to an arcade and play old Sega Arcade games from the 80’s\, you can go to a place that has phones where you can hit on women. The weirdest by far there is an “erotic video store.” You pick up these videos out in the open world and then go to this place and watch them. Its so weird because its FMV and the videos are kind of sexual. For example the video that I watched was this girl that was on her knees and very sexually she blew up a balloon for a good minute. It was so odd but the weirdest part is\, at the end. The camera cuts to a box of tissues and your character kind of lets out a deep breath.The game also has 2 more story driven mini-games. For Kiryu\, you’re running around buying up real estate and becoming a real estate mogul. I did that for a little while but it wasn’t that fun to do but it was a quick way to make money. For Majima\, he would run a Cabaret Bar which is something that I have never heard of before but I guess they’re common in Japan. Essentially a man goes to this bar alone\, sits down and then some girl who is a employees of the bar\, sits down with him. She then gives him company by flirting and talking with him. It’s very a odd and kind of sad concept but I won’t get into that. I enjoyed running the Cabaret Bar more because there was more to do with it all. You would hire new girls\, re-design the club\, level the girls up and change their appearance. Plus there was the actual mini-game of actually running the bar. Patrons would come in and you had to pair the customers personality with one of the girls personality. The more you did this mini-game\, the more your girls would level up and the more successful the business would become.This is a game that I can highly recommend\, it was fun and the story was engaging. Its everything that I like about video games and I look forward to playing more Yakuza games.… Expand",true

It’s really good. The writing is great\, the characters are mostly really interesting and well developed\, the actual events of the plot make sense given the world it takes place in\, and though it’s almost never incredibly exciting plot wise I always wanted to see what was gonna happen next.•The combat is the prevailing gameplay system and it’s... fine. It starts out much better than it ends up becoming. Eventually it’s just tedious\, and while it’s still pretty flashy\, it becomes boring to see the same things over and over. The ability trees do not add much of anything at all\, frankly\, and this is kinda surprising given how much is there. It just never feels much different. The fact that there are multiple styles of combat for each character is a very good thing\, though\, and it’s commendable for sure. They do feel pretty unique from one another.  Boss battles are never great\, except maybe the first? As I said it’s kinda exciting at the start. I always loved the QTE moments and maybe that’s what set them aside for me. The system for healing felt a bit off to me\, where you consume items to replenish heat too. Idk how I haven’t mentioned heat yet actually. It’s basically just how effective you are and it’s built up when you attack\, taken away when you use heat moves. Heat moves are these things you can do when you got certain weapons or when you’ve knocked someone down or are in a certain position idk there’s a lot of times it’s available. And they’re fun. They get a bit dull over time using the same ones\, but they’re never not enjoyable to look at. The heat system is a little annoying though it can be frustrating to lose all your heat when having three bars is the most fun at all times.•The substories vary greatly in my enjoyment. At the start they were fun. They took a while to get annoying\, but they did. I didn’t have much fun with them once I got through about half with each character. None of the situations are that interesting or exciting. The relationship building ones is kind of an interesting concept though and it’s pulled off decently though I couldn’t really care less for any of them.•The businesses are both pretty well thought out\, but they also get dull over time. By the end of both stories I just didn’t care. But the systems for building up money with Kiryu is somewhat engaging\, more at first\, and the mini game for Majima’s never turns bad. But doing it too much is certainly a bore.•The world in this game does not impress me at all. It’s not fun to look at\, really\, it’s not fun to explore or run around\, it’s full of enemies who’ll just attack you outta nowhere and you gotta do this little chase every time to get away from em but sometimes you’ll just have to fight them if you mess up. Just not at all a part of the game I enjoyed. Not even from the start. And I have no clue why you can’t fast travel to certain places like your businesses.•The world is full of mini games and most are just ok. None are great\, but they’re a decent time. Except karaoke. That’s always fun.•The music is good when it’s not the same track played over and over and over again.•The game isn’t astonishing to look at\, but I never minded it. The actual cutscenes were something I always liked to watch\, but the other dialogue stuff isn’t that impressive. There are three kinds of dialogue in this game\, and while the other two forms aren’t bad\, I always looked forward to the cutscenes.•Even though it is Japanese\, I enjoyed the voice acting in this.Overall: I really enjoyed myself for a lot of this game. All of the story\, basically. But over time everything else became a bit too monotonous. I just didn’t care to finish every single thing\, because this game is long as hell. The combat occurs much too often\, a lot of it does feel like filler\, but this game is well written and interesting enough throughout that it kept me pulled in. For almost none of the time playing it did I want to be playing some other game. Near the end I was glad to be getting it finished\, but that’s the same for nearly every game I’ve played.… Expand",true

As a newcomer to the series\, it was nice to see the characters in almost their base form and see what drove them towards the events that will happen in the first game.For those that don't know and might be interested in this series\, the Yakuza series is filled to the brim with everything that's over-the-top. Whether it's the story\, the combat\, or the crazy weird side quests\, this game throws everything and the kitchen sink at you. Starting with the story\, as stated before\, this is a great starting point for the series and for people to get into it. It hits on alot of stuff that seems like it will carry over to the following games. While the entire game is in Japanese\, you can tell that the actors they got for this are top notch. Especially those who played the main two leads\, Kiryu and Majima. And while the story goes deep into soap opera territory\, especially and most notably towards the end\, it's still a very good story. Set along side a wonderful soundtrack that beautifully captured the main events perfectly\, the overall cinematic feel that basically everything in this game has really sets it apart from other games.The combat is where things get a little dicey for me. I've heard it compared to old school beat-em-ups like Streets of Rage. I'm personally not a huge fan of the system. You seemingly just point your character towards an enemy and mash buttons till they are dead. There really aren't very many combos and the game relies too heavily on counters as trying to set them up is extremely difficult because the lock on system is not very well done and far too loose when trying to lock onto one enemy in a large group of them. It could use a little more refining going forward.With so much to do and see in the game\, it's hard to pass up on this. I had to take a point away because of the messy combat system and the soap opera-y tone the story took on late. But I'd highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get in on the ground level. Especially with the upcoming release\, and proper\, remake of the original game due to come out in a month or so.… Expand",true

Some examples of especially great subquest from where I am at is:- Producing a tv show without knowing anything about producing- Helping a dominatrix get better at her job- Speaking through a portable phone (again\, trust me\, it's harder than you'd think)- Defeat a huge guy who\, if you don't defeat him which is very likely you don't\, will steal all the money you currently have on you- Helping a hardcore band be actually hardcore (this one's probably my favorite of all of them so far)- Going full real estate\, buying buildings\, collecting money\, hiring staff\, all while trying to get a hold ofKamurocho from The Five Billiionaires- Helping a kid get an adult mag while other people are watchingAnd just to top it off\, the best features of the game:- A fantastic story with fantastic pacing- Fantastically written characters- Tons of side content to do after you're done with the story\, though I highly suggest people do them as they play the story- Amazing simple to learn\, hard to master combat- Memorable layouts of the open worlds- Some of the best villains in any game period- Fantastic controls- Fantastic soundtrack (especially Judgement) and sound design\, and finally...- THE ABILITY TO PAUSE A CUTSCENE WITHOUT SKIPPING IT!10/10.

And there may be button mashing combat encounters\, all of which you may have seen hundreds of times in dozens in other games\, but none with the dry humor or atmosphere of Yakuza. I could make a list of all the small frustrations you could encounter in the game too\, but this game is almost above any sort of focused criticism. Yakuza is just a good time and it maybe even one of the best gangster tales told in the last 15 years too.… Expand",true

Yakuza 3 was an awesome intro to the series (which included a recap of 1 and 2)\, as it make was a clear love letter to Yu Sazuki's Shenmue\, Japanese manga (shonen\, I believe) and a Nintendo classic River City Ransom.  Also\, as a personal note I've visited Japan several times\, so it was a delight to playthough.Continuing into this entry\, I was hoping to get a true origin story to both Goro and Kiryu.  Truthfully\, you don't really get that\, instead it really is just another dramatic story set before the events of Yakuza Kiwami (or Yakuza 1\, on the PS2)  Kiryu\, the series' main protagonist isn't really portrayed as meek\, instead he is shown to be wiser and as strong as when I saw him in the third entry.There wasn't really a deep look into his past\, such as growing up with Nishiki and Yumi\, nor any flashback to lessons from thier adoptive father Shintaro.  Kiryu just beats people with his fists and then gives fatherly wisdom (at the ancient age of 26) to mothers\, misguide youths and old men.Which truly leads me to believe that the series can only be taken serious during the main storyline.As for Goro\, they make him a complete opposite of what he is portrayed in the series.  In 0\, he's humble and quiet\, sweet guy whose just conflicted and damaged.  Whereas in the remainder of the series\, a friggin murderous lunatic dueteragonist.  Granted what he goes through before 1988 would explain insanity.  But none of this is truly developed throughout the main storyline.Also\, the supporting characters act completely different from who they are in Kiwami (which I am playing now\, and loving it)   What does save the story is the side stories\, which were funny and some a nice slice of life moment to experience.In regards to the gameplay itself\, the fighting is smoother and remained fresh with the newer HEAT finishers and boss QTEs.  The money system felt a bit exaggerated and really required me to grind through the real estate and cabaret host minigames.  (I liked Majima's more\, personally)Overall\, the shear amount of content in the game is staggering\, as there are tons of minigames side quests\, collectibles and two HUGE management portions.I'd say I had a lot of fun with this entry\, despite its sloppy writing and almost nonexistent origin story.… Expand",true

At this point\, I can get better value out of a novel and a game designed around only weird minigames\, as then both would have the proper quality and not just **** around in the middle.cons:**** outrun. **** blackjack. **** catfights. **** mahjong. **** the timing in disco and **** the decade old combat system from the PS2 era.The camera auto rotates with the character which makes any tight corner a nightmare. It also gets locked on walls which means doing combat near rounded walls means you lose 60-70% of your vision.weapons hit a lot of invisible walls and make the character recoil for no reason.Accurate combat inputs at a high level is a nightmare. The game is enjoyable because you have enough health items and things thrown into it that it can be overlooked. However\, actually examining the controls leads to a lot of problems\, many of which are brought out in the climax battles. Inability to properly target enemies\, slow turning\, auto target targeting nothing\, the inability to just turn around like a normal human being can\, weapons not aiming correctly\, heat action prompts appearing and not working 80% of the time\, a 3 second delay on  starting most heat actions after a combat command has already been used\, and so on. It is the same crappy combat from 10 years ago and with so many other games doing combat better the only saving grace of this game is the niche void it fills.Pros:Side stories are enjoyable. Very Yakuza-esque.… Expand",true

The story is one of the best I have experienced in a while and I feel is the best part of the game. The 3 parts of this game are the story\, the main brawling gameplay\, and the massive amount of minigames. The minigames are wacky and fun and act as a great diversion to the serious main story and compliment the game very well\, my only issue is that along the main story you are forced to do most of these minigames at least once which at some points when i wanted to just get to the next piece of story were quite annoying. My main problem with Yakuza 0 is the brawling main gameplay. The fighting system in this game is satisfying and very fun at first\, with multiple styles and upgrades. The issue comes in when you are 30 hours in and each segment of fighting takes forever and you are spamming cheap moves just to get to the next piece of story. By the end it gets old and you will be doing TONS of it. Besides the repetitive combat this game was very enjoyable to play and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good stories or enjoys having lots of variety of side content.… Expand",true

But actually i wasnt able to force myself to finish it.First of all it has just too many cutscenes. And i think there are better ways to tell a story. Other games\, like for example MGS also have very long cutscenes\, but at least they offer great gameplay besides them. In Yakuza gameplay is very weak. Its not open world per se\, its just bunch of streets and thats all. You cant drive or shoot which is very disappointing for open world crime game. Fighting feels like mindless button mashing\, it has nothing to do with great fighting systems from modern games like Batman Arkham series\, not to mention slasher-figthing games like DMC or Bayonetta. Yakuza just feels old and clunky.Substories are supposed to be funny\, but are just stupid\, illlogical and dont fit dark atmosphere of game. There are a lot of boring fetch quests that will waste your time but wont be fun or memorable and side activities are equally bad and uninteresting.Overall i wanted to love this game\, but i just cant. Its just old\, archaic and not fun when compared to modern games.… Expand",true
