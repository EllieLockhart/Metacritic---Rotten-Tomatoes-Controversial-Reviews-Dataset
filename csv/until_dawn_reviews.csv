Most of the characters are straight unlikable where you couldn’t care less if they died or are around in-game so little that you wonder what the point of them are. I saw reviews that all said how much they didn’t like Mike but he became my favorite character because he got stuff done and didn’t panic about it.This whole game banks on the butterfly effect\, that every action you make has consequences and will affect the ending of the game. Shocker it doesn’t. Many of the choices end up with the same path\, leaving you feeling vastly disappointed. I’m okay with my choices not really making a difference in the game but when you tell me that they do and will and I clearly see they don’t\, it’s really a slap in the face and screams of developer laziness. That perhaps they wanted to make this deep game but could not but still pretended that they did. One choice had you choose which person you would rather sacrifice with a ban saw\, I chose the girl to save my bro and the game sacrifices my bro. I sat there stunned because I knew I had chosen the proper button\, for a while I thought maybe I had messed up\, until it turned out that whichever decision you make your bro will die. Then there were weird ‘nature’ decisions that said if you hurt animals or nature would have major consequences\, which were just dumb. Many of the choices you could make were dumb\, hey you wanna shoot the explosive barrel right in front of you? I’m sure nothing could go wrong\, it was literally a death totem. They present these to you so fast that once again they’re just hoping you make a wrong choice\, like you have an itchy trigger finger.Story-wise problems I had is that up until a point (about halfway) the main antagonist (the killer)\, which I had really cool ideas of who it could be and why (none of which happen)\, is blatantly revealed to you in the room before you come face to face with the killer\, like written on paper and you read it obvious\, (you know in case you did no investigating whatsoever)\, so when the killer takes off their mask and is like dun-dun you’re like ‘yeah I know\, I just read it 5mins ago’. And then after this reveal the character promptly drops out of the story\, basically forever. And then the whole story takes a shift into the new antagonists. Not the ‘we had parallel plot-lines going and finished up one and continued with the other’\, but we started a whole new plotline midgame. A new protagonist is introduced and promptly killed off after he gives you exposition of what’s going on up on the mountain. Basically the game switches into why Mike is my favorite character since you switch over to him and he investigates and solves the whole mystery himself. The second-half plotline should have been the whole game\, solving the mystery of what’s happening on the mountains and its dark past was pretty interesting and had me trying to piece it all together. If they had focused on just that\, they could have fleshed it out more and made a stronger story and game. The outside narration with the psychiatrist could have just been completely cut out as it served no purpose\, once again nothing you said to him matters or really has any effect. …Spiders… Overall\, you have to be playing this game really poorly to have anyone end up dead or have the game cheat you at the end. I found totems\, made decisions and proper button presses and only had the one person get his head popped like a pimple because suddenly the game wanted you to get off the linear path they put you on to find a journal\, basically saying all the other stuff you found telling you about what happened to the sisters\, no one knew cuz apparently they don’t talk about this stuff between characters.The only gripe with gameplay I had was the moments where the game told you to keep the controller steady (as though they thought you were so frightened you’d be shaking and find this impossible). It actually should have told you to keep the controller within the outlined field they had at the bottom of the screen because it artificially moved the icon and you had to move to counteract it. I physically placed the controller on the ground and yet the icon moves anyways. The game is doing it to cheat and make you screw up in pivotal moments\, because the first couple times I was so still but it failed.In the end\, most of this game felt like it was just straight up copied from Supernatural’s S1E2 Wendigo episode. I guess the game is worth one playthrough\, it does have spooks and some interesting moments\, just don’t expect anything spectacular.… Expand",true

This is an intriguing sort of horror thriller that is super fun to play and to watch. (I had company each time I played and they really enjoyed watching.) The storyline is a tad generic but there is enough going on that it will keep you entertained\, especially with the matrix of effects based on different choices made by different characters at certain points.This game doesn't have a lot of action control because it's not supposed to be high action game. Actions are going to be walking\, interacting with things\, and performing controls under duress.If you're the kind of person who uses walkthroughs and does everything flawless the first time\, this game will not have much replay value. If you're the kind of person who is okay with going back to certain chapters to do different parts over\, this should be entertaining for a little while.DEFINITELY worth playing\, but not worth paying $60 to own.

Really well graphics\, creepy atmosphere\, authentic Voice Actors and high overall audio quality. Sure\, things you can interact with are limited\, but that´s not the point in this game.

Of course you have to deal with immature youngster dialogues and naive but authentic behaviours. It didn´t annoy me at all\, instead it assists the immersion of the game in my opinion. I could not experience significant FPS Drops with few little exceptions which doesn´t disrupt your gameplay. There may be creepier games out there but Until Dawn does a good job at jump scares and other horrors.I´m writing this review during my first session and already had severe decisions to make with even more severe consequences to my youngsters. At this point i predict this game has some replay value because you are able to decide very differently at various points. For 25€ I consider this game a bargain.

94199,UD,2016-01-06,9,"So I had heard and seen a lot of people doing lets plays of this game and claiming it was the best scary adventure in a video game they had in a long time.  Now unfortunately I had a Xbox One and was really jealous of all the fun it seemed people were having with this game.  So I bit the bullet and bought a PS4 to play this game and various other titles.  But this was the main focus at the time for the PS4 purchase.  I had everything setup and friend coming over that weekend to do a play through of the game where we'd in a sense vote on different moments to try to really get it to be an interactive movie experience.  I must say from the start of the game it really sets the tone of being a teenager horror flick.  It pretty much throws you right into the game where you play the sister of a girl who gets a terrible prank played on her and it pretty much ends in disaster.  Then the game picks up a year later on the anniversary of the incident that killed the 2 sisters.  Right away the tone is very reminiscent of movies like Evil Dead Remake\, Cabin in the Woods etc.  The game provides some pretty good frights and if playing with a group adds a fun dynamic on what conversation choices to make and which things to do or not do.  We all pretty much agreed that the scariest part of the game is the inter-chapter / episode interactions with Peter Stormare.  Every time you interact with him its fun to notice the changes to his office.  It's truly the creepiest part of the game.  I mean you get to pick that you are afraid of clowns and needles.  And then it translates itself into the game which is pretty fun.  The game does a fantastic job of building up the intensity during each episode and building up to pivotal points.  Just like a TV show you get those cliff hanger moments with one character then you quickly shift to another character at another place and take control.  Only to jump back to the cliff hanger moment in another episode.  The TV esque recap of the previously happened in between each episode adds a fun factor to the game.  I must say the first 60% of the game is awesome where it turned south for me is when you find out that everything was just a setup that the Brother of the deceased sisters created.  But then you discover that there are these monsters called the Windingos who are going around killing every one.  Similar to the movie Decent it really took a turn for the worse for me.  It's was a lot more fun for me to think there was a homicidal maniac chasing me than some zombie like cave dwellers.  With all that said I still played through the game a 2nd time to see if my prior choices mattered.  And I quickly realized it truly only matters from the stand point of keeping people alive or letting them die.  There is really not much as far as the actual game changing.  If you don't pick that you are afraid of clowns Josh will still have the clown mask.  The choices are a fun addition but when you realize they don't mean much it really takes away from the fun factor.  Still I really enjoyed my play through of Until Dawn and would highly recommend any one to play this because it really will appeal to all types of people this is more of a interactive movie / tv show than a video game.  Sort of like the old Dragon Lair / Space ace games just with more choices and variety.Until Next time this has been an Until Dawn review by Garcessist.… Expand",true

The timing of its sounds\, sudden loud noises\, etc. which affects the instensity of a horror game. In relation with the game\, Its sound are ok and also well-placed in the game. Tbh\, im had more jumpscares in my headphones than the actual game though\, so it did a nice job atleast. A score of 8/10 deserves this aspect.Graphics - Now in relation of environments...ITS GREAT\, the mist\, the forest\, the darkness\, everything in the environment really feels creepy and gives you that scary and reluctance to even want to experience it. As to the characters\, They all look realistic with the developers doing a good job in capturing their facial expression movement\, everything. However\, my main problem is its cutscenes which tends to lose its frame rate more often and some cutscene delays its unnerving considering it is a game/horror films which most of the time you are watching. A score of 8/10 for these.Total Average = 7.6Well\, i can see the developers really tried their best in making this game. Its not perfect\, but its far from being a dissapointment. They did a good job of hiring a renowned indie horror director to put life into the game and got real actors to perform their characters both in voice and motion which puts realism in the game. The gore are damn cringy and would not recommend eating while playing these game. A good\, short but satisfying experience overall.… Expand",true

The meetings with the psychiatrist were a great addition.This would easily be a 10/10 if it weren't for the fact that your decisions don't have much on an impact on the story. Yes\, you will influence who lives or dies (and when they die) but that is it. No matter what the gang will go back to the chalet to blow it up. No matter what Josh will get the saw. No matter what Matt and Emily will go to the radio tower.

There really is only 1 ending with slight variations. The chalet blows up and everything else is just a cosmetic variation.

But instead I will explain my reasoning on why you should purchase this game and enjoy the many wounder for yourself.1. It's not a corny and goofy wanna be game; as I first thought when i saw the trailer for it. To its core the game provides moments of great suspense and interesting view point on how the game will develop throughout your session.  Moreover for the most part (except for 2 characters) the cast of Until Dawn are a likable bunch with their unique features to like and dislike.2. I am going to be honest with you if you are a fast paste\, FPS\, MMO\, MOBA\, or RTS type of gamer (like me)\, this game will not quite satisfy you because its an exploring game as well. Therefore you must set your mind in a way an RPG player might have who enjoys exploring and immersing yourself in. If you get that mind set you will start to enjoy the game\, if you are stuck with a fast paste mind set you might hate the game or struggle through it.3. Simple to the point\, it has many choices and they do weigh a great deal through the game. The choices in Until Dawn are not like some other games I played in which you might think it will impact the game progression but in reality it does nothing.  (I'm looking at you Dragon Age Inquisition)4. Finally I would say you will get your moneys worth\, I beat the game in about 18 hours in a relax paste\, and I have no regret spending 60 dollars on it.  So I would say you should buy the game and enjoy the game charm. Thank you for reading and sorry for my poor English I am not a native speaker.… Expand",true

If you are not a fan of those games or the interactive story genre\, I might recommend skipping this one. Otherwise\, if you're a big fan of that noise\, you'll be as pleased as I am.I have only a few minor criticisms. First is the sound design. While the atmosphere and the music and ambient noise are all spot on\, all the dialogue sounds like it's been recorded with an iPhone\, all tinny and far away. Whether or not this is intentional (to maybe conjure feelings about old slasher films or to force you to turn the volume way up so as to be more startled by jump scares) is beside the point\, as I found it difficult to hear what the characters were saying. I would have preferred to play the game without subtitles but had little choice.The other big issue is the character control. As I'm sure many others have pointed out\, controlling the character was a bit difficult due to the fixed camera being switched about on its own. While I understand that they are strategically placing the camera as they would in a film (which is something I actually quite like) it made reorienting the character a little less fluid after each camera change. This in turn affects where your character points their flashlight/phone\, which was never quite where I meant to point it. I also VASTLY prefer an inverted Y-axis\, and this game gave you no option to adjust this.Besides these few criticisms\, the game is stellar. It's gorgeous\, well acted\, exciting\, and infuriating; I've found myself yelling at the dumb teenagers BEGGING them not to do the stupid thing they're about to do.

I knew there would probably be the option to go through each chapter again individually\, so I could change some things\, or pick up clues I'd missed the first time round.But the maddeningly slow pace in many parts\, and the frustrating inability to turn back to grab clues during the story\, diminished my investment in the game to the point where I just didn't care any more.Let me expand on that a bit...Too many times\, you're walking around wishing you could get a better camera angle on a scene\, plodding along (often in almost complete darkness). Then you cut to a new camera angle that really doesn't match the flow of the previous angle. So often I laughed out loud as my character seemingly did about-faces several times while i oriented the stick to the new flow of motion.And don't get me started on the stairs. *All* the stairs.Then there were the bright\, glinty-spots that indicate an interaction point. These could be for examining something more closely\, grabbing a clue\, or performing some action from which you cannot return (i.e. dropping down or climbing up). While most of the time\, the X indicated if this was one of the latter actions\, sometimes it did not leading one to believe it was a clue. Then upon hitting X\, you see your character drop down and realize...great! I can't go back to investigate any more in the previous section. Several times I missed clues that would have changed the story had I not inadvertently moved along the story line without realizing it.One could argue that this is part of the fun of the game; the uncertainty of chance and all that.

Why is there a Nathan Drake? And did the dialogue have to really be so bland? Some bad subtitling didn't go unnoticed. Another thing is when the camera is kind of close to a characters face\, sometimes it looks awful... I'm guessing there are texture bugs or something. It's also really weird when they put in high res textures which are used in about 1% of your play time.While the general plot is fairly predictable - which is okay - it does give hints and attempts to use some lore stuff. If you bother to read then you'll understand why the Wendigo doesn't just slaughter everyone and it's appreciated.The totem thing is okay\, but many were just irrelevant and it just seemed like a replayability excuse.

At first\, they think it’s going to be a fun and perfect reunion amongst friends. However\, things start to go wrong\, in more ways than one. Soon\, they are each fighting to survive on the cold\, dark mountain.Until Dawn has eight main characters that the player can control. They are: Sam\, Josh\, Mike\, Jessica\, Emily\, Matt\, Ashley\, and Chris. As the story progresses\, you come to either love or hate the people. We all have our favorites (Chris!) and least favorites (Jessica\, ugh). The gameplay and cast go hand in hand\, making a very movie-like experience. Until Dawn is not afraid to make players think. I feel like this is something too many games fail to do these days. We need more games that force players to tread carefully and make smart decisions (or dumb ones). Every decision you make in the game leads to another event. The Butterfly Effect feature shows players the results of their choices and how certain things happened because of a decision they made. You must face the consequences for your decisions\, no matter the outcome. The “choices” players make within the game are basically quick time events. They are as good as quick time events can get\, too. Never is a choice for absolutely nothing. I really like the freedom of choice in Until Dawn. It makes the gameplay flow smoothly. Aside from that\, there are lots of cut scenes\, that are very well-done I might add. There’s no real time combat\, but the game makes it all work without it.The visuals of Until Dawn are breathtaking. The snowy\, secluded mountain setting packs a ton of atmosphere and is the perfect place for any movie or game in the horror genre. The particle and lighting effects here are second to none. It just adds even more to the already gloomy atmosphere. My hat is off to the developers for making Until Dawn such a visual treat. The sound design is nothing to shake a stick at either. While the game isn’t dreadful\, it has plenty of jump scares to keep things on edge. It also has some Saw-like moments that will gross some players out. The premise is somewhat of a cliche\, but the game finds ways to innovate via its gameplay style\, not to mention\, there are some great twists and turns along the way that will catch players off guard. Until Dawn is truly a unique experience and its a game you should definitely pick up. It clocks in at around 9 hours if you play at a normal pace. I genuinely hope there is a sequel\, because I want more of Until Dawn! It’s beautiful\, atmospheric\, entertaining\, truly unique\, and offers high replay value. Don’t miss out on this one.… Expand",true

Moreover\, true personalities will be revealed as well which will change your attitude to these people because everyone will be under severe pressure making life mattering choices\, and as the story went on I had no regrets having Sam as my favorite one!Do the choices matter? Hell yeah they do\, minor things can mess the whole story up\, even though some events(very few) are going to happen anyways(does not relate to the ending\, the lives of the friends are entirely in your hands! Even being too slow while crossing a river may mess the situation up!As the story reaches its middle things get a bit less tense(may be different for you\, everyone reacts differently)\, but emotional connection to protagonists keeps you feel stressed and involved cause after hours you played trying to keep them alive you don't want to make a mistake which will waste your efforts. There are many hints in the game which  may help you to make right choices(danger\, fortune totems) and I want to tell you straight away - if you pick up death totem that does not mean the character is going to die anyway\, it is just a possibility\, everything is in your hands!This is an amazing game\, goes to one of my favorites\, don't understand people who are very critical about it\, if you question price tag just think about how much work has been done of finishing paths for all different choices and the beautiful graphics this game has.

Friends hugging\, loving couples(of which there are 2 in this game) rejoining\, kissing each other\, that kind of stuff. However\, game ends less emotionally\, just going to the titles with video interview of survivals\, I think it is a bit wack for such tense and emotional game\, should have done it better.Nevertheless\, great game\, seeing some people giving 0 to this game is just nonsense\, this title has definitely achieved great success in making choice based horror game.

This has been done a lot before and it can be off-putting for some gamers.Overall\, though\, don't let my 8 out of 10 rating for the game raise ANY doubt\, \""Until Dawn\"" is a lot of fun and it's a game I feel horror fans and PlayStation 4 owners should absolutely not miss out on. If you have a PlayStation 4 and you've been ignoring this game\, you need to stop doing that. Do yourself a favor and play this game. It's a worthwhile edition to any PlayStation 4 collection.Final rating: 8 out of 10 \""Great\""… Expand",true

94399,UD,2016-01-23,4,"***SPOILERS AHEAD***While I must admit the graphics are pretty awesome\, the controls are pretty decent\, and it obviously sounded good enough to buy and try out there are DEFINITE problems. It starts out really nicely. It has good creep factor and as you go thorough out the story it actually has really good development! Sadly\, although you can decide who lives and who dies the main premise is only differed slightly and incrementally (unlike Heavy Rain). That said\, while this game boasts about how your choices greatly influence the outcome of the story.... they don't. Your influence is very minimal and Emily ALWAYS lives regardless and the mysterious stranger can't be saved--he must die EVERY time. There are also character traits that also change with your choices. You can boost or hurt relationships with other characters\, become braver or less\, honest or not....but regardless\, it makes absolutely no difference in how they act towards one another which sucks and is kind of too bad. The only thing that changes ending wise is who lives and who dies...only to some extent. There aren't really DIFFERENT endings per-say (like in silent hill) just more like... a few options as to who is there when it ends.The story\, however\, was actually pretty good--at least the first part of it. Once it went on with wendigos though it just died. It went from being a really cool murder mystery with a potential real killer (which seemed to be the case since it set out to be realistic and not anything to do with fantasy game) to just garbage. In every version of the story\, there will be wendigos (AKA Magical Cannibals) and that\, for me\, is a big game ruiner. They made me absolutely not care about the rest of the game or what happened to anyone. Especially when the characters decided it was a good idea NOT to stay still (which is how you avoid them) and instead go to the mines (their nest) at night (while they're awake) and run around. SMART! NOT! It would have been SO much better if there had actually been a real psycho killer up on the mountain--not magical cannibals.… Expand",true

It has been up to this point that I have wondered how would it turn out if such stunning effect were applied to a game in the horror genre (Life is Strange is largelyOf recent I have enjoyed Life is Strange and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture - two games of which use an extensive narrative viewpoint in their own unique ways\, coupled with varied elements of gameplay to stunning effect.  It has been up to this point that I have wondered how would it turn out if such stunning effect were applied to a game in the horror genre (Life is Strange is largely fantasy\, and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is largely science fiction)?  Until Dawn answers this question.In the game you follow a story that is pure classic horror\, recalling such masters as Wes Craven\, John Carpenter\, Sean Cunningham\, George A Romero and many more.  The story sprawls between a number of main plot threads with you controlling a series of characters and partaking in decisions to situations that may not only have immediate ramifications\, but may and will alter the outcome of the game as a total.  Control of the characters is kept to a strict limit\, with them effectively being a 'cursor' or 'guide' in the gameplay segments\, solving simple puzzles and being involved in action sequences that use quicktime events.The presentation is outright stunning\, the graphics detailing amazing facial reactions to the characters - a lot of the game is spent in conversation and if the graphics were not up to the task\, it honestly would have suffered.  Also of note are the lighting effects and the improvised 'camerawork' to action sequence and tense moments - someone's clearly done their homework and it shows\, for this not only reveals an understanding of the horror genre\, but in how movies work.  If anything does suffer\, its the occasional framerate stutter or slip\, and its a (very) minor slip.Sound also excels with a stellar arrangement that whilst not providing any signature melodies\, piles on the tension and pressure when it needs to.  The voice acting is of a really high standard\, and there's only an occasional bad dialogue (this is extremely rare).The gameplay has to rely on a combination of good plot and enough involvement to keep the player going\, and thankfully it more than gives in this area.  The plot sprawls and never fails to enthrall\, whilst the execution of tense and action moments is beautifully executed.  Then there's the added fact that the choices you make in the gameplay affect the game greatly - I'm on my second playthrough currently\, and honestly there are a HUGE amount of differences in the plot.This of course will come down to your enjoyment of the genre\, and how the game plays-out (it is effectively an interactive movie).  For me\, I loved the sheer offset nature of the whole game.  On one hand\, I am being led on a path in which I make choices to affect future actions\, but on the other hand I am presented with a wide range of choices I have to make in order to try and keep everyone alive - and that also includes how I react and perform when I am asked to\, with no exceptions if I get it wrong.A superb game that may not appeal to action junkies\, but for veteran horror fans and anyone who enjoys the 'interactive movie' style of game\, this is definately for you.… Expand",true

Some might not even consider it a game\, since your actions are very limited in nature. If you've played any of David Cage's recent games\, you will know what I mean. There are fixed camera angles\, tense atmosphere\, interaction witch specific items and the occasional dark humour.Until Dawn is definitely not for everybody. It harnesses mechanics that 99% of games nowadays don't employ. At least not to such an extent. For example there are QTE-s that translate to split-second decisions which can determine whether your character dies or lives to see another scene. This can be infuriating but also intriguing. So your favourite character dies right before completing the game...does this spike anger or motivate you to a new playthrough? Only you can decide. Just a warning - if a character dies\, there are no checkpoints or reloads. That character is dead permanently until a new playthrough.That's the thing though. At least to me\, decisions like these motivate me to give it multiple playthroughs. You're probably not going to get the same results or even the same ending. There are also loads of small clues and items you will most likely not find in your initial playthrough. They might be insignificant\, but since you're already invested in the game\, why not read them and get the whole backdrop.This is running on the Killzone Shadowfall engine with occasional frame-rate dips. That means the graphics are nice enough\, but the faces and grimaces can get downright creepy at times.The voice acting and sound are superb though. Best played with headphones in a dark room. The game is also short\, around 5-6 hours\, perhaps a bit more on your first playthrough.I can totally see why some people might not even consider it. It's short\, it has QTE-s\, very little combat and is heavily story-driven. If you like horror\, fixed camera angles\, decent jump scares and witty humour then maybe you should give it a try. I did and enjoyed it. An 8/10 from me.… Expand",true

It feels like a movie\, in which you make the decisions. It's nice to have an experience like this once in a while.I played the game through with my friends during the weekend and the game wasn't that scary\, to me at least. My friends said that it was somewhat scary\, but not on the same level as Outlast\, for example. Though we didn't use headphones or a surround home theater and obviously we had each others' company and support. Jump scares are something the game has a lot of though\, especially in the beginning. I'd say there's even too much of them\, although the game is supposed to pay homage to the old horror films with the cliches included. That is something you have to keep in mind while playing the game.Unfortunately the game has some pacing issues. Sometimes you walk around for a good while before anything happens. The occasionally awkward camera angles don't really help either. However this doesn't detract from the immersion and tension too much. The game makes up for its issues with great characters with marvelous voice acting\, a tense atmosphere and an intriguing\, if a bit predictable\, plot. Also\, don't let the QTE's scare you away.

It's just like watching a scary '80s-'90s horror movie (very much an homage to classics such as Scream\, Ravenous\, Saw\, or modern movies like The Cabin In The Woods)\, but you control the action\, and this \""movie\"" is over 8 hours long.The first few minutes really gets you emotionally involved in the plot\, and while the reunion is a bit (a lot) forced\, it works in terms of the scary movie genre that the game is paying homage to. The tension starts right away\, and it does not let up for a moment. Even in quiet moments you're worried about what might be around the next corner. The game really gets the atmosphere right. Also\, you care for each character\, and while it's true that some of them are not wholly likable (in horror movie tradition\, some are immature and they can be unkind\, self-centered or unthinking)\, you really feel as if you want to get them all through the horror that is about to overtake them.The game controls are intuitive and effective\, movement is smooth and unlike a few other games that have appeared recently\, the characters move effortlessly from one place to another\, without getting annoyingly caught up on furniture or architecture.The clues and collectibles in the game are very effective\, and the in-game menus work well to help the player assess how well or poorly the game is going. During the action sequences\, the player needs to make split-second decisions and controller inputs\, and in my opinion (speaking as an older but experienced gamer) these are perfectly balanced to appeal to players of most abilities.The graphics are amazing\, from the facial textures to the snowfall\, lighting and shadows\, this game really uses this latest generation of consoles to bring out detail and atmosphere. Music is very atmospheric and extremely well integrated well into the action.Replay value is wholly focused on survival\, not on a branching plot. This is not a bad thing: while the overarching plot remains fixed\, the fate of each character is very much decided by your actions and choices: any character or all of them can die. Conversely\, any or all can be saved\, but saving everyone is very hard: I only saved two of the eight characters the first time around (Sam and Emily). I'm looking forward to restarting in the hope that I can somehow get at least a few more people through \""until dawn\"".The most innovative aspect of the game is what the developers call \""The Butterfly Effect\"": a build-up of small\, seemingly insignificant changes that may have devastating consequences down the line. This feature shows itself even in the first play through\, as an in-game menu screen tells you which decisions you've made and gives subtle hints as to how you're doing. It's not just the illusion of choice - if you mess up too often\, people's allegiances change and their options may narrow\, making it harder for them to survive. Sometimes\, a small mistake will be recoverable\, but the mistakes do mount up\, and sometimes the choices made leave no way out. At the game's end the sun rises\, but who will be there to see it is up to you.My only criticisms so far (all are very minor):1: The camera sometimes doesn't feel as if it's showing enough of the scenes\, and it can make movement tricky in darker areas\, but then again\, that may be a conscious decision because of the need for a survival horror game to be claustrophobic.2: The scenes with the psychiatrist take the player out of the action to some extent\, but on the other hand\, they do offer the player a break in what might otherwise be a very tense game\, at least until later on\, when even these scenes acquire some tension.3: There is some very minor image freezing that lasts a split second\, usually when performing an action (I think I noticed three examples throughout the whole game).4: The voices are occasionally slightly out of sync with the characters' mouth movements (again\, I noticed this maybe three times).5: The characters' heads seem kinda wobbly at some points (whenever it's a close-up and two or more characters are close to each other and talking). It's very subtle\, but it is noticeable.6. There is no way to adjust the screen size in the game - on my TV it's still playable\, but some items on the screen edges are clipped.7. I would have liked a little more humor to break the tension at some points - it's a very tense game (I think I mentioned that).8. The pre-order DLC is just a small inconsequential scene tacked on to the end of chapter 2. It's almost like a deleted scene in a movie and it kinda messes with the pacing. I was kind of expecting a little more.Altogether\, I had a blast with this game\, and I think a lot of other players will too\, even if this type of game is not their usual fare. For me\, this is not just one of the best survival horror games I've ever played\, but if it were a movie\, I'd say it would be the best horror movie since The Cabin in the Woods. Yeah\, it's that good. I will be very surprised if this game doesn't gather a few of the most prestigious Game of the Year awards.… Expand",true

It leaves one wondering why and how the game got stuck inWhen I first heard about Until Dawn\, I was a bit worried.  Here we have a game that was supposed to come out on the Playstation 3\, and yet it is just now coming out as Playstation 4 exclusive. This is almost never a good sign\, as games made under these conditions generally tend to have outdated graphics and sub-par gameplay. It leaves one wondering why and how the game got stuck in development hell. Topping it all off\, Until Dawn is another \""movie game\""\, like The Order 1866; 1866 was met with a lot of mixed reviews\, most less than flattering.  All that being said\, I am a big fan of horror\, and so I decided to preorder it anyway. I went to GameStop in the morning to pick up my copy. \""You look like you're here to pick up Madden\"" the GameStop employee said as I walked up to the counter...; the horror had already begun.  Sports games!?  My worst nightmare! As soon as I got my copy of Until Dawn I fled GameStop\, then rushed home to give it a try.  I delved into Until Dawn with an open mind\, despite all of my worries.  Right off the bat my worries began to fade.  This doesn't look like a Playstation 3 game at all!  The graphics are phenomenal; some of the best I've seen.  The characters are very well rendered with superb acting behind them\, and the storyline was immediately engaging. I braced myself for a long day of gaming. Oh boy here we go...This review will have no spoilers\, with the exception for some very minor things from the first 15 minutes of the story. Until Dawn has it's tongue in it's cheek from start to finish. The game is intentionally silly\, with dumb characters who want to explore strange noises alone.  It includes cliches from teen horror movies ranging from the 80s to present day.The story starts off with a group of 10 friends who are going to a remote cabin retreat.  A prank is played on one of them\, and she becomes upset. In her bout of anger\, she runs out of the cabin in disgust\, with her sister trailing her. The duo never return\, and their bodies are never found despite a search of the area. Fast forward to one year later. The eight remaining friends return to the cabin on the one year anniversary of their friends death. Upon arriving at the cabin\, there is one thing on their minds - to put the past behind them\, seek forgiveness\, and have a good time.  Too bad for them there is some maniac stalking them\, wanting to kill them all.  Who is this person?  Is this the same person responsible for their missing friends one year ago? How many leave the cabin alive is up to you; you end up choosing how many of them survive; all\, none or any variant therein. This ability within the game leads to many possibilities for the player\, allowing each player can make the gameplay their own. I thought that was pretty neat\, as well as effectively encouraging multiple play-throughs.Until Dawn is a \""movie game\"".  There is minimal gameplay; mostly quick time events and making difficult choices that affect the outcome of the game.  You also get to explore some atmospheric areas and there are some elements of combat as well.  Despite the minimal gameplay it's still a lot of fun and a roller coaster ride from start to finish.  It's always intense\, scary as all hell\, and out to get you. Until Dawn is well paced\, and by well paced I mean you'll be **** your pants every 10 seconds.  The sound design and music are nothing short of top notch.  The music will make you clench your butt cheeks.  Every creepy sound will increase your heart rate and anxiety level. For the full audio experience\, headphones are an absolute must when playing Until Dawn.  The graphics\, as I said before\, are incredible from both a technical and artistic standpoint.  The cabin is creepy and the snow drenched mountain wherein it lies is beautiful.  You will\, of course\, explore a lot of other areas; but that would be spoiling it for you.  Speaking of spoilers\, there are a lot of good twists and turns within the game.  Most of them are very smart\, despite the aforementioned overall silliness of the game.I stayed up until dawn playing Until Dawn. I simply couldn't bring myself to stop until it was over and the credits rolled.  When it was all over\, which took around 7 hours\, I was left wanting more.  I never expected Until Dawn to be anywhere near as good as it is.  It really shouldn't be this good; it's just another \""movie game\"" like The Order: 1866.  But it is obvious that the developers had a clear image in their mind of what they wanted the game to be\, and they brought that vision to life. Their success even makes games like Heavy Rain seem somehow lacking in comparison.  A lot of people will talk badly about all of these \""movie games\"" but if they're learning from Until Dawn then bring 'em on. So was Until Dawn a Playstation 3 port as I first expected? Nope. Not even close. Until Dawn is a complete next gen experience from start to finish that is just as fun to watch as it is to play.… Expand",true

But after playing it through and with only 3 characters surviving the journey\, I released that the choices you made actually did impact the game a lot. it was far more interactive than I had first thought.The characters\, although mostly unlikable at the beginning\, start to grow on you as they are tormented through the game\, often showing a different side that you might not expect. So if they do meet a grisly end\, you feel connected enough to actually care.I ended up playing it through about 3 times in the end as I wanted to do a blind run first and then go back and get all the trophies. Each time i finished the game the ending was substantially different. meaning the complexity of each tiny choice made\, branches off in to a unique path\, a true Butterfly Effect. so it makes you choose wisely and actually ponder as to what your decision might mean later down the line.Graphically this game is beautiful\, the lighting\, character models\, textures and effects make for a very believable world with real character and mystery. each area looks totally unique from the next. The animations are on a whole pretty solid\, with a few stiff moments here and there.The sound and voice acting are also pretty good\, with each character looking and sounding different enough from each other that you know who's who. my one exception to this is the character Emily\, who soon starts to grate your ears every time she speaks.The environmental sound design is also great\, with subtle noises in the distance\, to those big cinematic moments\, it has a cinematic quality that adds to the tension and on screen events.I won't spoil the story though as it's best to go in knowing nothing. But it's definitely enjoyable and very interesting\, with a lot of environmental storytelling too if you want to delve deeper.All in all\, i thoroughly enjoyed this game\, although i wasn't expecting to. For anyone else who's put off playing this until now\, I can wholeheartedly recommend it.… Expand",true

94500,UD,2015-08-25,10,"The gameplay is focused on exploration\, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making countless decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total\,",true
94522,UD,2015-09-14,7,"Contains spoilersPremise:A group of young college students (aged late teens) travel to a cabin one winter which happens to be in the middle of nowhere\, no electricity\, but plenty of candles and a hot steaming bath filled with cucumber melon salt. The evening does not proceed as expected and ends with the disappearance of two twin sisters. To try to move forward in their grieving\, the group decide to get together the following year in the same cabin. Unfortunately for them\, this trip will quickly turn into a nightmare. The choices you select will have a weight on the outcome of the scenario.So I have played it and I must say and I didn't have the highest expectations for it. The marketing is exactly how it turned out but it's not the route I would have taken for the game. I think something more ballsier and I am talking about the short QTEs thrown in\, surveying the environment\, exploration\, character development. All these things that make it what it is: An interactive movie - It is formulaic in a lot of ways\, and it still felt like that same T.V slasher-cheese fest formula we are used to.Let's talk about the good things: multiplayer engagement - playing the game is best played cooperatively imo. Someone assumes the controller and there is hot seat rotation. As you progress\, so does shouting unanimously and voting between the choices that appear as a group - creating an atmosphere of participation and engagement that works well with the survival horror themes the developers have geared it towards - rotating around eight playable ensemble characters throughout the game.Now about the gripes and things: as the characters are introduced in the beginning\, I could not help but feel this showcase of friendship seems forced and not genuine and random. I don't buy it. It is as if the dialogue is the same kind of quirky dialogue and the voice of one strong writer buried under others. Character archetypes and narrative writing mashed together to create this friendship circle. Yet somehow\, none of the characters really share many compatible social traits borne of real emotion for one another. Seldom there are some really great concepts going on for the characters but they never really develop. It doesn't help that the mo-capped actors' ages range larger than their in-game counterparts\, but the script and dialogue for me personally is not there.Also - WTF - most of the characters have a tendency of scaring each other\, verbally abusing one another\, screaming. Both rather funny and deeply unnerving; perfectly calm one minute and then melodramatic. There is a good amount of tension but for goodness sake. The quirks are no substitute for actual character traits. These jump-scares combined with cheesy line reading\, the game is reminiscent of slasher films: Cabin in the Woods\, Saw\, Scream\, but I mean like we are reacquainted with some of the most obvious recycled tropes going. But it does not really commit to one of these films and is fun mess overall.There are romances and couplets happening too - the story follows a simple pattern based on this idea might look as follows: the storyline cuts between two characters at a time\, most of the time\, once the party are split. There's even friendship mechanics in the menu options with metres and emotions...\, But for the most part this feature feels unpolished\, cosmetic and filler - not really offering much to the gameplay. There is no real emotional core\, no real development\, nothing to learn from it. What is going on.The main girl character\, Samantha (Hayden Panettiere) and the main guy character\, Michael (Brett Dalton) develop interestingly. More so Emily who after giving the best worst manner of first impression I can remember in a long time becomes tolerable later on and centre of some cool QTEs. We all fall on hard-times I suppose.Seeing as how this is an movie blanketed as an interactive game\, what really delineates from one another is the linear interactive progression with slapped-on\, adrenaline pulsing QTEs. But the player-controller mechanics themselves are not particularly varied. Sprinkled throughout and repetitive in form.What's really bizarre is the reveal of \""the stranger\""\, aka Flamethrower man. What are you trying to do with this character. In the middle of nowhere we actually have this really cool guy. Something happens to him later on... he's managed to survive this crap. We want to invest time in him (because he's not a college student and has shifted in some power-control). It's kind of embarrassing for him... I feel bad for him... Yeah.In summary\, this game is very weird in a likeable way but not in a way I would recommend it to someone who would play it alone. What I will say it is entirely watchable. The strength lies in the conceptual framework of group-play and bawling at the cheesy tensions it provides through to the very end.… Expand",true

As a lover of horror movies\, when I found out I could play through one\, I was setting aside the cash months in advance to be sure I was ready for this gem when it came out.I wasn't disappointed.Until Dawn puts you in control of 8 friends who reunite at a mountain retreat a year after a horrible event. These character range from the typical \""geek\""\, the prom queen/king archetype characters\, the jock and the rationale girl who\, in a typical horror movie\, you would deem as the \""final girl\"". The great thing about this game is that anyone can be the \""final girl/guy\"" and any of them can die.And because this game is filled with characters that you will undoubtedly grow to like and some you will despise (yes\, I had one in particular)\, it may be in your best interest to put your personal feelings aside because this game may tempt you to let some meet their fates\, but in doing so can seriously impact the progression of the story.This game uses a Butterfly Effect system. Much like the horrible Ashton Kutcher movie\, this means that choices you make as one character during one scene can impact that character later on either positively or negatively. But it can also have an impact on other characters in scenes later in the game. This\, of course\, makes the replay value that much higher. It will make you want to go back and play through again and make different choices to see the various outcomes. Beware though. This game constantly saves (almost like it's recording it as it you play). This means if something goes wrong\, there is no reloading the last checkpoint in an attempt to do-over. If your favorite character meets their grisly fate\, oh well. Better latch on to a new character and do your best to keep them alive.The story is pretty cliché in its execution. A bunch of crazy kids go to a mountain retreat to have what could be their last hoorah after a tragic event from the previous year left them all somber. Horror ensues\, people die\, love can blossom and stupid dialogue is spoken. The acting is decent\, considering some of these people are relatively unknown\, and some even outshine the more well-known actors (yes\, Hayden Panettiere\, you needed to do better in some scenes). The maniac stalking you wears a creepy mask and\, of course\, the game provides decent jump scares.As far as the actual action of the game\, much of it involves walking and exploring the really graphically beautiful areas looking for clues as to who the madman is as well as why the events of the previous year took place. When real action takes place\, it's mostly cinematic with you having to perform quick time events to keep the scene moving along. Beware\, these buttons pop up in various areas of the screen and can be hard to see sometimes. A mess up doesn't always mean game over\, luckily. But too many stumbles by character A\, could lead to them not being able to rescue character B in time\, just for an example. But if that happens\, again\, the game keeps moving. Shed a tear or even a smirk at that character's death and keep on trucking.The PS4 was a great console for this to be released on. The graphics are stunning. Using facial capture\, the characters look just like their actor counterparts and the details are insane. Pause the game when playing a character and see what I mean. You can use the R analog stick to move their faces to get a good look at the details.Until Dawn is not a game everyone will enjoy. As a player\, you take a backseat to most of the action which for some isn't what they look for in a game. But if you enjoy a good narrative and like to have a bit more control over said narrative\, then this game is worth a try. Those people who enjoyed Heavy Rain a few years back and even Indigo Prophecy from a decade ago (I enjoyed both) will definitely love this game. And the horror factor\, especially during the first play-through\, will keep this game interesting. Since many won't be able to save every character during the first play-through\, it can be a game that can be on constant rotation for months!… Expand",true

One playthrough of the game is enough\, is what I want to say\, and you can quite fully understand the story even if you don't find all the clues. You can go back to the episodes and try to get your favorite character (not that there were many for me) to make it\, but that's about it. You're not making very many moral choices (maybe one or two)\, most of them are just random and their consequences completely unforeseeable. I'm fine with that\, but the opening sequence made me think the game posed as being more than that.What it comes down to is that you don't do much here as a player\, almost half of the action seems to take place in cut scenes\, except for the times you do some quick QTE button pushing or you're asked to make a choice or quite boringly wander around under cinematographic camera angles.

It is well-worth the anticipation and wait\, as well as all the trouble it went through in production. It's discordant and lacks true focus in certain instances\, but it never loses track of what it is or where it's going\, making it a creepily tantalizing game and story.Concept: Revel in the atmospheric horrors of a classic slasher film from the comfort of your couch\, and better yet make the decisions leading to gruesome and sometimes hilarious and well-deserved deaths all the while progressing through an interesting and malleable plot.Graphics: The visuals\, the animations\, and the overall content showcase a fine level of quality and add believability to the resume as well. Yes\, I probably made that word up.Sound: Both the melodies and the voice work add to the already well designed experience and add a higher sense of tension appropriately where needed.Playability: While the majority of gameplay focuses on simplicity\, that's not to say it isn't still a highly enjoyable and interactive experience.Entertainment: I hope you like tripping and being cleaved in half by a tottering psychopath\, because that and even more is in store for you if you choose to play this game.Replay Value: Moderate.Overall Score: 8.0… Expand",true

We looked at eachother and we started laughing and  looking everywhere for if there was a wolf in our living room\, hahahaha! Our neighbor didn't find it that funny and started banging on the wall! And playing Emily in the mines... Goodness gracious... Can't you already shut the hell up blody Wendigo? Hahahaha!!As for the story\, I love games where your actions affect the course of the game's story\, in Until Dawn they have captured that and have taken it to the extreme\, having the possibility to kill all characters for the slightest judgment or decision that doesn't even seem that important\, and just to remind you they tell you what you did wrong\, like: \""It's your fault he's dead!\"" :\,( They have done a great job and have taken care of every detail\, you discover the history of the mountain and all the horrific events that occurred there bit by bit.There was only one thing I don't really get to understand\, and it's Dr. Allan's role\, Joshes psychiatrist. At the beginning I can clearly see that all those questions he asks you about your biggest fears and all that stuff is what go seeing along the adventure\, but when you reach certain point in the story... Well\, it lost its meaning and his purpose is not very clear. Yes\, we get that he's an hallucination and that Josh is crazy\, so what?Nevertheless\, I've had a blast both times I played with my girlfriend and the next time I'll do a collect'em all trophies.Definitely a good title to enlarge my PS4 collection :) See ya!… Expand",true

Thankfully\, Until Dawn succeeds in doing so.Eight friends gather together in a remote cabin on top of the mountains. Things start of well with each of the characters trying to have a good time; however\, little did they know that they are not alone; something or someone is watching their every move. Panic escalates when the group suspects that they are being hunted so they start helping each other to find out the mystery behind all of thisUntil Dawn is a survival horror game that focuses on quick time events\, each of the characters will face different situations throughout the game and you will have to control each of them by taking choices and tough decisions that will affect how the game plays out for each character’s.The choices and difficult decisions I had to make kept me at the edge of my seat because of how smartly they were done. I had to stop and think for a while on what choice is best.From the relationships between the characters to the shocking deaths\, everything you do means something. Would you take a short cut and avoid the risk of falling or would you play it safe and follow the footsteps? The choices are endless. I liked how the characters interacted with one another; each one has his or her own personality traits that helped in making them feel unique. My personal favorite was mike\, a funny and brave character.The controls are simple\, choosing your actions were straightforward and the sensitivity controls worked perfectly especially by adding tension in climax situations.Throughout the game\, you will collect totem prophecies which foretell a possible future event. How you play will determine whether or not the prophecies come true. Collecting clues is important as this will help in solving the mysteryThe details of the facial expressions are impressive and the overall eerie environments along with the good camera angels successfully give you a sense of lonelinessThe main campaign took me around 8 hours to complete but the replay value is high so you will find yourself going back and playing the game many times to try different things.I enjoyed the progression of the story. After a series of strange events the characters find out that a psychopath is after them and the suspense and tension rises. The psychopath reminded me of Michal Myers and Jason\, the way he walked and stalked you was scary.Until Dawn never felt boring I just wanted to keep on playing and find out what happens next.Until Dawn is like watching an awesome horror movie\, the creepy music and countless number of scares were awesome. The clever story is filled twists and turns and I never expected anything.

It's a good game if you like story\, (however disjointed at times it may feel)\, it's also a good game if you like beautiful graphics and pretty good mo-cap.It is not a good game if you value gameplay. This is an artistic piece through and through. I played it and don't regret it one bit. I won't however\, be playing it again.The game starts at a pretty decent pace and without spoilers\, will dig it's meaty claws into your shoulder and will not let go. It's full of horror tropes you've come to know and love\, (people going alone\, things that go bump etc...). For the most part you may not care about the characters as much as you led to believe by the butterfly effect system.  I saved 4 people on my playthrough\, but knew I was damning a few and didn't really care. I wanted to see it finished.The first half of the game is where it's strongest. You have no idea of what is going on and it makes for some tense creepy moments. It borrows heavily from various horror franchises\, but yet seems to be it's own. In between each episode you see a piece with Peter Stormare\, that is pretty well done. It's beautiful and it works well.The failing begins during the second half of the game. At this point\, the plot\, (again without spoilers)\, takes a heavy turn and it's not for the best. Imagine watching a slasher flick that suddenly becomes a supernatural romp and you get the idea. It almost felt as if the writers had painted themselves into a literary corner and now were looking for an out.For those who say all it is\, is QTE; it isn't. But it does rely heavily on the QTE button presses for some of it's scenes. The problem here is that failing some of these QTE doesn't always end badly. For a game that has no compunction with death\, it seems a little out of place. Sometimes the failing of the QTE can actually be helpful.The sound design in this game is a definite strength. For jump scares\, use headphones. You won't regret this part at all.  The character designs are well done and the Mo-cap is really well implemented...to a point.Some of the animations when the characters are talking seem really wire-framed and limited in motion.  There is little in the way of true gameplay here. You walk\, you look at shiny objects\, you pick things up and you QTE certain areas. That's about the gist of it.One major gripe is how the camera can shift when you are walking in one direction. Effectively this can change the direction you need to press to be able to continue in the same direction. It's reminiscent of Resident Evil in that way.There are multiple endings in the game\, which can be altered via the butterfly effect. Admittedly I only played through once\, but I have no desire to go through the game again. Yet somehow\, I doubt the game itself up until the end point changes very much\, which is a shame. It would be nice to see that if Character A dies and I let Character B live that the game is very altered. All in all though the butterfly effect just doesn't seem to have wings. It's just a caterpillar still on the ground.So if you are looking for a game heavy with story\, this may be for you.You want a roughly 7-9 hour long interactive movie\, pick it up\, but I'd wait until it is down to the $20 mark if I were to be honest. I paid $40 and it still felt like too much.I gave it an 8\, because for what it is and what it tried to do\, I thought 7 was too low. If I could even though some people don't like half marks\, I would give this game a 7.5… Expand",true

Therefore\, you can both say it is a lazy effort by the developers or that they are just loyal and gave good research to those classic horror genre in its golden era. due to this\, it will be very common for you to feel frustrated to the usual stupid decisions teenagers make in this game. However\, what really interests me is that you as a player can decide for them in certain aspect of the game\, and by doing so. You may or may not help them survive until the end. It will not change the general story however\, it will give you more interactions since more characters will be alive by then. However\, my main problem is that for a horror game\, it never was scary for me at all. Yes there are a few jumpscares here and there and creepy places. But after finishing the game i never felt any reluctance to play it again like what games like alien isolation gave to me\, i couldnt feel any more of this scary moments or pressuring moments. With these\, a fair score of 6/10 will do.Gameplay - Gameplay also returned to the days where Resident evil and Silent hills dominates the horror genre with its fixed camera in your exploration. As to the interactivity of the game\, i can say that it is good despite its lack of quantity esp. those scenes where you should not move since most of them will usually result in your character being put in a bad spot or may jump to their deaths. Another to thing to add that the whole campaign is short but since it is a story driven which changes based on your choices\, it has a great level of replayability. You can decide to kill them or try to challenge yourself to make them all survive. With this regard\, a good score of 8/10 deserves this aspect of the game.Graphics - As to the environment\, it is almost perfect. The places are haunting\, creepy and will really give you the goosebumps in your exploration. As to the character design\, i liked how the developers really put effort in the motion captures of its characters. Their facial expression are realistic and detailed. However\, my main problem is the FPS drops that comes more often than not in its cutscenes and due to this\, delay of sounds or voice sounds occurs which gives me major problems since it is a game where you spend most of the time watching than playing it. Therefore\, a score of 7/10 deserves such plus and minus.Music and Sound - The music of this game overall is good. The timed sections has that loud music which puts more pressures to you and the haunting ones are properly inserted in those creepy areas which adds to its uneasiness. As to the sound\, Id say it has its ups and downs\, as to the ups\, voice acting of the characters is good and also the sudden sounds that comes in within jumpscare moments are spot on. In fact\, i had more jumpscares from the sound rather than from the game's visuals. The downs is the same with the cutscenes that sudden framedrops occurs which makes the sound delay and not following the mouth movements of the characters. Considering all the factors i have said. it deserves a score of 7/10.Average score = 6.75 (I dont round off my scores since i dont give perfect scores and zeroes i.e. 9.6 rounded off to 10)Supermassive games really showed that they have potential to make story driven interactive games. It needs some improvements like its story and also that bad fps and needs more scary moments\, but overall\, i was satisfied with the game. I hope they would continue to improve in this aspect and release games in the future that would be in the level of quantic dream games. awesome and hope they live until dawn\, lol.bad joke i know just kidding.… Expand",true

To clarify\, the characters\, the different types of villains\, and the setting as a whole were meant to feel familiar and stereotypical. Not unlike Joss Whedon's Cabin in the Woods\, Until Dawn isn't really meant to be a standalone experience - you won't enjoy what you're seeing to its fullest if you haven't also seen at least some of the substantial source material.So the player controls 8 teenagers (portrayed by actors who most certainly are not teenagers) as they wander around a spooky house\, a sanatorium\, and the forest and such surrounding the two locations\, picking up things and piecing together what happened at varying points of the mountain's past. The game jumps you from character to character to try and keep the narrative going. The characters have set attributes\, as well as relationship meters with all of their friends\, and your actions as each character alter how the others perceive you. Choices you make as one character resonate with the others\, and change the story.On that note\, the \""butterfly effect\"" system the game is so proud of (it even gets its own intro cutscene)\, isn't as robust as the ones found in the Telltale games\, or even that of Chrono Trigger. Supposed recaps of certain situations happened differently during my playthrough than they had when I was playing them. While the consequences were the same\, there was an odd disconnect in seeing things that I didn't do work out the same way as the things I actually did. Similar problems arose regarding lines of dialogue that didn't make sense in the context of my actions.Gameplay-wise\, most of the game is walking around looking at things and flipping them over. If you've played L.A. Noire\, that's honestly the best way to describe it - right down to the over-the-shoulder camera when you pick something up and use the right stick to rotate it. Here\, however\, is where the most noticeable problem of Until Dawn shows itself: it doesn't control well at nearly any point in time. The game operates on a nearly fixed camera (think Resident Evil\, or a Telltale game again)\, but the right stick is still used to move your character's light source around. Everyone turns too slowly\, and the light sources\, whatever they may be\, are difficult to control\, because it's hard to tell whether the game wants you to move the right stick in relation to the camera or the character. I'm pretty sure it changed sometimes\, as well. But that's tolerable; the real problem is once the right trigger comes into play.Players use the right trigger (R2) to pick up objects\, push buttons\, open cabinets\, and so on. To push a button\, you must hold R2 until the character's finger presses the button\, then release R2. To pick up an object and perform an action with it\, you must hold R2 to pick it up\, and keep R2 held while doing whatever else is required; releasing R2 will cause your character to place the object right where they found it and then just hold their hand in front of it\, like they're trying to manipulate it with the Force. Furthermore\, for some strange reason\, all of the actions that involve movement in one of these R2 sections translate that movement to the right stick\, not the left. Anyone who's played just about any 3D game will understand that the right stick is used for camera control\, and that this is wrong. These sections appear often\, but thankfully aren't usually time-sensitive.In all honesty\, however\, the thing that really lowered my opinion of the game was the lack of a consistent story in this story-based game. In trying to wrangle all of the horror subgenres into one game\, the developers made a story with far too much going on at once; as though they were aware of this\, they then sliced away every plot point previously mentioned\, and put an entire new one in for the game's last third. With more than half the game involving a series of red herrings\, the final\, much more action-packed hours lack the tension and interest that was built up for the majority of the game. Furthermore\, Until Dawn is\, like the horror films it so lovingly emulates\, predictable to the extreme. Every plot twist is foreseeable\, even after the radical shift in subject matter in the last section of the game. And\, as a side note\, most of this horror game's \""scares\"" are jump scares that have no context nor significance to the plot at all.Despite these concerns\, I still enjoyed Until Dawn\, as did my family and girlfriend who all sat down to watch the story unfold. But I think I enjoyed it more than some because I got it for about $30\, rather than the full price. Like a bad horror film\, rent it\, or buy it on sale\, and you'll have a good time.… Expand",true

I know this because (1) I completed the game over the weekend and (2) my wife was as engaged in watching me play it as I was. As a (now) casual gamer married to a woman who hates video games these two things never happen. ISure\, this can hardly be called a \""video game\"" as that term has been defined over the last 30 years\, but whatever the hell you call it\, it was a wonderful experience. I know this because (1) I completed the game over the weekend and (2) my wife was as engaged in watching me play it as I was. As a (now) casual gamer married to a woman who hates video games these two things never happen. I suppose that says more about how this experience is not a video game than anything else\, but video games are evolving and I suppose this will be a case study on that point.Unfortunately\, the thing most likely to kill you in this otherwise tense experience are its first 2.5 hours. This part of the game just moved too slowly and the scares had no substance to them. As a fan of the horror genre\, that “thing lurking in the shadows” can only turn out to be a harmless **** so many times before I stop taking you seriously. This isn’t to say that the scares should commence right out the gate\, but too many false starts are what nearly caused me to put the controller down on this one forever. If the creators want to lull me into a false sense of security before unleashing the proverbial beast\, I would appreciate it if they were quicker about it next time. This wouldn’t be so bad in a game where you can do more than walk at a snail’s pace\, but with the exception of its set pieces\, that’s really all you can do here. This has the effect of forcing you to endure 2-3 hours of slow\, uneventful “gameplay” through the introductory chapters. I'm too damn busy to spend all that time doing nothing.Another gripe I had is that when you are in control of them\, the players can never move faster than a slow amble. If you hold down the L1 button you go from moving at 1 mile per hour to moving at 1.2 miles per hour. However\, the game rewards exploration\, possibly more so than any game I have ever played. This sends mixed messages by encouraging you to check every corner of every environment\, but also making it frustrating to walk your character's slow ass across the room. This frustration is exacerbated when the characters have to explore some of the larger locales. The experience would have been much better if you could at least jog. This would have allowed me to get through the game’s slower moments without sacrificing the tension I am sure the developers were trying to achieve with the whole walking thing. I’m left wondering why the creators of the game even gave you the option of “walking faster” by holding L1\, when there was no meaningful difference in the character’s pace.Notwithstanding the above\, there are many things I found in this game that I want to see in future video games. The setting is fantastic and the graphics are incredible. The game is just amazing to look at. I also appreciate how the choices you make have consequences that the game forces you to live with. The game is constantly saving\, so if a decision you made results in a character’s death\, or leaves the character without a weapon\, you have to move forward with that. What made this feature so interesting is that the consequences of your decisions are not always readily apparent: sometimes the consequence of a decision you made much earlier in the game does not manifest itself until the game’s final chapters\, when the **** really hits the fan. Another quality I found interesting is that the choices I made did not always turn out the way I would have expected.Despite what I am reading in other reviews: the story and characters are brilliant. Reviewers are complaining that the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes to which I say two things: (1) no\, they aren’t really\, and (2) so what? On that first point\, the characters definitely start out as stereotypes\, but they (and how you feel about them) will change based on the decisions you make. At one point early in the game\, you rank the characters based on how you feel about them. Naturally\, I made my choices based on the things I had observed up to that point. As the game progressed however\, the way I felt about certain characters changed dramatically. I have never had an emotional attachment to video game characters quite like I did in this game.  By the end of the game\, each character was a byproduct of the decisions I had personally made.  So\, if you played the game and still think that the characters are stereotypes\, then perhaps that says more about you than the characters themselves.Lastly\, I prefer conventional video games where the interactivity aspect manifests itself more in the gameplay and less in player decisions. I hated Beyond Two Souls and the minute I learned that this game was going to be much like that gameplay-wise I was seriously off-put. In fact\, I un-preordered Until Dawn and did not buy it. Instead\, I rented it and I am damn glad I gave it a shot because when the developers address its issues in future games\, I am looking forward to giving them my money.… Expand",true

93853,UD,2015-09-02,8,"I’m gonna get this out of the way.  Until Dawn is very fun to play.  It may have its flaws\,  but I can’t stop enjoying myself from playing it. Here’s the best part\,  I hate horror movies so bad because I don’t like the scare factor or jump scares that are plenty for the horror junkies (medical reasons.  Cough). And here I am\,  laughing like an idiot when those moments happen.A yearI’m gonna get this out of the way.  Until Dawn is very fun to play.  It may have its flaws\,  but I can’t stop enjoying myself from playing it. Here’s the best part\,  I hate horror movies so bad because I don’t like the scare factor or jump scares that are plenty for the horror junkies (medical reasons.  Cough). And here I am\,  laughing like an idiot when those moments happen.A year after the disappearance of twin sisters at a mysterious cabin on the hill\,  8 high school students get back together for a reunion at the request of Josh\,  the brother of the twins. Upon their arrival\,  weird things begin happening to them and it’s up to you as the player to try and get all 8 of them alive (it’s possible).  Or not.The game’s basic premise is to give you the director’s seat of a B movie grade horror slasher flick. Complete with corny cheesy lines that you can expect from those kind of movies. Based on what you do with all 8 characters\,  they live or die\,  despite how they will emerge at the end of the game.Why I find this game so fun is how great it feels to be in the directors seat. You have total control of who lives and who dies. In words\,  this won’t feel much. But this power is best demonstrated in a room full of people showing them how you want the fates of the characters to be like. Hate Jessica as much as I do? Let her get abducted and then walk as slowly as you can to try and save her. The same concept can be applied to other characters as well like\, leading them to weird kind of areas that are bound to give you something to be afraid of.And boy the jump scares are funny.The game employs common jump scares that you can expect. And when they do happen\, I can’t believe how I feel rewarded for guessing them right. In fact\, characters that I have invested in that I want them dead in specific moments\,  feels satisfying as heck! I agree it’s psychotic that I want these people to live or die\,  but that’s the beauty of the directors seat!Another interesting option in the game is that it wants to know what you are scared off.  Based on what are you afraid of\,  the game will change its surrounding and effects based on what you have chosen.  If you are afraid of gore\, there will be tons of blood and guts ready to be spilled.  But if say you hate needles\,  it will keep showing u pointy objects. It’s a very nice feat in my opinion and slightly enhances the fear factor. The much talked about “Butterfly Effect” is a good way of branching storylines that depending on the choices you make\, changes how the ending of the character can be (whether lives or dies\, with cloth or not). This may take some of the thrill of not being able to back track in the game away\, but makes every choice a lot more of interesting to decide on.Technically\, I can’t avoid complaining about the frame rate. This game is gorgeous\, but the frame rate dips are a bother. In fact\, there are moments in the game that i felt could have been improved\, like shorter explorations that gets me to the next scene. Walking faster doesn’t seem that fast either. Controls\, whether motion or stick based\, could use more polish as well. Animations are… a hit and miss. Sometimes\, the motion capture is good. Other times\, they look like they were made in the 90s. Some facial expressions are even scarier than the jump scares!It’s weird for me to say that this is a great party game for you to play. But when I was younger\, I remember being a part of Resident Evil 2 playthrough party\, and the screams coming from everyone were euphoric. Until Dawn has been successful in giving me that good old feeling of a good horror game\, despite its immediate flaws. Remember\, play with a room full of people\, lights off\, and let the fun filled horror begin!… Expand",true

Randomness is fun when you can correct for it - not when it's in a turn-based experience with no repeats (other than starting the level again).

94098,UD,2015-11-22,7,"I enjoyed Until Dawn thoroughly. It's definitely a great game\, so why am I only giving it a 7? Well\, first of all is the re-playability. Once you know the story\, there are no more surprises for next time around. That's not a bad thing on the whole - often with re-plays you already know the story. But the problem with Until Dawn is that you *expect* a different story given the 'Butterfly Effect' system. You even expect your interactions with other characters to change the story - but they don't. (There are certain stat bars for how you have interacted with the others\, but whether you get along well with someone\, or not well at all - nothing seems to change within the story).The 'Butterfly Effect' system is used to change how the story pans out. And it doesn't. Well\, it does. Kind of. People can live or die depending on the choices you make\, but this will not necessarily impact the way that your game will follow through and end. That\, in itself\, is disappointing.These points aside\, Until Dawn was a very enjoyable game on my first play through. With plot twists\, I never knew what was next. The game kept me on the edge of my seat constantly and I couldn't stop playing - I just had to know what was going to happen next!The graphics are superb and the sounds are chilling. The story was enjoyable and\, at some points\, unexpected.Despite my review score\, I would definitely recommend playing through Until Dawn\, however don't expect anything dramatically different if you decide to play through it again for a second time.

It just made the whole thing kind of uninteresting compared to the first few chapters. I didn't mind the game being not as dependent on the player's choice as advertised\, but as I was expecting to play a slasher I was kind of disappointed to have to deal with monsters and supernatural BS for half of the game.I just wished that Josh was so mentally ill to actually try to torture and kill the characters instead of just pretending it.

At noFor anyone who may not know this is a decision based interactive game which also has some gameplay which is mostly quick time events and also a little bit of aiming/firing. I would recommend this as a must play or must buy for anyone with a ps4 for many reasons. The first is the quality of the title. I found the story and design interesting throughout which motivated me to continue. At no point was I bored and I credit this to the breakaway rotation of the characters you play. Essentially play until a mistake or the chapter ends. In the case of a gameplay mistake the game just cuts away to another character and you play that character for a while. I really enjoyed how this not only limited boredom and frustration but also boosted interest in what the consequences of the mistake was going to be. Secondly the gameplay is for anyone. Kids to seniors honestly could play this. It's scary but not too scary\, gameplay is hard enough without being too hard nor is it too easy to be insulting. A nice mix was achieved and I presume the reaction times for this determination were determined during a tutorial test. Third\, the game is inexpensive considering its quality and gameplay duration especially since you can replay chapters after the game is over or just start a new game from the beginning. The most important reason though to try this game is that I just can't see many interactive games being developed with such love. In the bonus footage one actor suggests interactive games will be the wave of the future. I strongly disagree. In my opinion only several ideas will make strong decision based games and horror is probably the number one formula for it to succeed in. If true the games have a limited source to tap. Thinking about that the game are cliche\, will unlikely go blockbuster and from there the industry will likely shy away from making these games with a lot of resources. Luckily I feel this is the game that went all in and crafted a unique game to showcase the genre. In turn I feel this will be the epic peak of this genre as I just can't see many interactive games being better made than this. I just can't see how one can improve upon this game other than directly tying it to a sequel or more. But for what it is this is a very highly rated game for your first experience of this type of game and I give thumbs up for every aspect of its development. Very cheap entertainment imo.… Expand",true

Things soon take a turn for the worst however....It's difficult to play Until Dawn without making immediate comparisons to Quantic Dreams titles Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. Thankfully this effort from SuperMassive Games is more interesting than either of those titles but your opinion of the game will still hinge greatly on just how interactive you expect want your games to be. The story itself\, while a little out there\, is relatively entertaining and the excellent cast (that includes Hayden Panettiere and Rami Malek) make a good job with the script. As the player you can't change the overall direction this story takes but your decision and actions\, or lack thereof\, decide how the characters react to each other and ultimately who lives and dies.Unfortunately\, from a gameplay perspective\, Until Dawn is far less successful. A large portion of the game is made up of wandering around (you can't even run!!) until you see a highlighted object that you can interact with. Occasionally you'll have to react quickly to certain events but this is always handled by QTE sequences in which you again just press buttons as prompted. A bit of editing to allow the important decisions to be made more frequently certainly wouldn’t have gone amiss.These type of \""interactive movies\"" continue to show promise but is there any reason the gameplay can't be enjoyable as well?… Expand",true

The story may be fairly unoriginal but it's well done and you can tell the actors had a good time with it\, even if Hayden Panettiere's character kinda doesn't fit in with the rest of the group dynamic very well. She feels like she was shoe horned in to give the game a little star power but it's not too much of a big deal in the long run. The main problem I have with the game is the gameplay portions. While the QTE stuff is over done at this point\, it's not the problem that the Resident Evil-esque camera and movement functions are. Sudden camera changes and just bad controls make things fairly difficult just to move around regularly. Fortunately that doesn't translate to the shooting portions and the QTE portions of the game.The game is good for what it is but it ended up becoming the PS4 exclusive for the holiday season and it was definitely not made to sell systems.

I was always invested to see what happens and it does have some surprised which will leave you interested in where the story goes.

La respuesta corta: es un videojuego.La jugabilidad es una combinación de exploraciones cortas\, Quick Time Events (algunos realmente muy rápidos) y\, lo más importante\, toma de decisiones. Esto último es lo más resaltable.El apartado de las decisiones funciona de forma excepcional gracias al sistema de Mariposa en el que todas nuestras decisiones impactan de forma directa a la historia. Yo nunca me había sentido tan responsable de los eventos que ocurren en un videojuego. En verdad funciona y en verdad divierte.Gracias a la inmersión del juego y a la personalidad tan delimitada de cada uno de los protagonistas\, habrá decisiones de las que nos arrepentiremos al ver sus consecuencias\, pero ya será tarde.Como punto negativo iba a decir la cámara.. pero al poco tiempo te acostumbras y entiendes que su propósito es\, precisamente\, lograr la inmersión de la que ya hablé.Respecto de la historia: ¡Es muy buena! Aunque puede sonar al típico cliché de película de los 90s se pone realmente interesante al poco tiempo. A lo largo del juego reunimos pistas de tres misterios diferentes (además de los Totem que nos dejan dar un vistazo al futuro) que se entrelazan por sí mismos. El juego usa tanto terror psicológico como screamers\, y funciona bien\, siempre querremos saber qué pasa a continuación.La sesiones con el psicólogo que aparece entre capítulos son de lo mejor del juego. Son muy espeluznantes e incrementa el nivel de misterio.GRÁFICOS Y SONIDO:A nivel audiovisual es sumamente sobresaliente. Los gráficos y animaciones son muy realistas\, y todos los sonidos que podemos percibir a lo largo del juego son precisos y atrapantes. El juego consigue un nivel de inmersión muy alto gracias a los portentos visuales y sonoros.Recomiendo ampliamente jugarlo con audífonos.INNOVACIÓN:El sistema de Efecto Mariposa es excelente. El juego tiene MUCHISIMA rejugabilidad puesto que el número de decisiones que tomamos son cientos. Y todo\, todo afecta a la trama. Simplemente genial.Como nota final: yo entiendo las criticas. No es un juego para todo el mundo\, mucho menos para aquellos que solo gustan de videojuegos de acción. Pero si uno se toma el tiempo de entrar a la trama y elegir las opciones de forma razonada de acuerdo a la situación y personalidades de cada uno de los 8 protagonistas\, es un juego asombroso en el que literalmente marcamos el rumbo.… Expand",true

I will go over Until Dawn through some main points.Setting:  It provided a dark\, creepy\, nerve wracking setting with the mines\, to an equally tense and foreboding atmosphere of a comfy lodge to an empty dismal one. The forest itself seems to swallow you whole at times. There were plenty of items to bring the deathly stillness and ominous feelings to a higher level. Everything from skulls\, dried blood\, broken furniture\, rusty saws\, creepy paintings\, high stairways and enhanced this. Whenver I had to walk around\, my eyes were constantly roaming around\, trying to see through the darkness or determine whether a chair was a dead body or something.Characters: There was a good variety of all sorts of personalities in the cast. You'll hate some\, you'll love some. All I can simply say here\, is that the characters had depths\, their dialogues with each other felt very real and they were relatable. I liked everyone personally except for Emily lol. But kudos to the voice actress and scriptwriter for succeeding in making her be so disliked.Sounds: Creepy and dark background music\, accompanied by screechings really tickles the hair on one's neck. It was fantastic. I also like the music that played on Jessica's cell. The sounds of crunching feet in the snow and other movements were also very accurate\, and helped alot with immersion.Story:  Without spoiling\, I'll say the story was pretty crazy (in a good way) and it really hooked me to keep playing. You're constantly going forward in hopes of surviving\, but there's also a secondary curiosity on what the hell is actually happening. The game provides good detailed clues to push the story forward and it really shows how the past affects the future. I enjoyed it immensely\, though I wish we got to play certain characters alittle more. We know too much about some\, like Mike\, and not enough for characters like Matt for example.Shortcoming: It'd be nice to able to run. Like seriously. If my loved one was in peril\, I'm not gonna walk around like I'm taking a stroll. Secondly\, already mentioned\, having more equal playtimes with all the characters would be niced. Being able to explore Josh's head more was very desired. The character's relationship bars also needed to play a bigger role in the game. Also\, the jumpscares were alittle overplayed in the game.Overall\, I would definitely recommend this game to fans of the horror genre. It's entertaining\, very human\, suspenseful and very enjoyable to play.… Expand",true

But unlike games such as Telltale's The Walking Dead where some things will happen no matter what you do\, in Until Dawn your choices matter and affect the story.Until Dawn's story is about a group of 8 young people who go on vacation at a winter resort in the mountains only to get into trouble because (surprise!) there is a psycho killer on the loose. The story begins awkwardly but soon it finds its pace\, and diverts from a simplistic Scream-like plot into a Resident Evil-esque one. The game's atmosphere is tremendous thanks to the amazing job done by the artists and graphics programmers of Supermassive Games.Gameplay is pretty simple\, you explore the environment and look out for clues or objects to interact with. There are many indian totems scattered around which offer visual hints of things to come (like a character's potential death or a way to escape from a trap). But most of all\, the game's full of choices to make. Some times you will have to defend a person in an argument\, other times you will have to sweet talk to them. The game's also full of QTEs\, but failing one doesn't necessarily mean instant death. There are also some nice motion control events and I suggest you play with motion controls enabled\, it adds to the game's immersion. Your overall choices will affect the fate of every character. By the story's end\, some characters may get killed\, maybe all of them will die\, maybe everybody will survive. It's up to you.My only gripe is the camera. It's not free to rotate like in most games. It's like the old Resident Evil games\, it's static and transitions into a new point of view as you walk around. It works\, but I don't like a static camera. Oh\, and the killings can be too gorey for my tastes.Overall this game is fantastic.

Loved the depth of choice\, the interesting characters\, the interloping plot. Was constantly kept on my toes and was genuinely scared at certain points. The butterfly effect and involving the players fears was such a great concept that worked so well\, when your characters can die from the wrong mistake then the story-line and your involvement mean 100% more than they did in a normal console game.Though\, unfortunately\, the game wasn't amazing as I thought it would be. (BEGIN SPOILER) the involvement of the supernatural element to the game just lost things for me - it just felt like such a cop out in terms of explaining the mysterious and complex plot. A real life killer is just so much more of a threat/fear than a spooky mine demon. As soon as that plot point was shown I even found the game to stop being scary. Went from screaming my head off at jump scares and saw-like scenes to not caring about the plot and shrugging when a \""scary\"" demon popped out. (END SPOILER) Was just super disappointed with the main plot-point of the game. If they'd gone with a better ending would have definitely given this a 10/10\, and it would have gone down as one of my favourite video games\, unfortunately that wasn't the case.Again\, worth the buy just due to how amazing the first 80% is\, the replay-ability\, the graphics/characters/music/etc. but just a bit a disappointing plot-twist and ending.

A horror story doesn't work if you have nobody to root for\, and so this one falls flat on its face\, which is a serious problem\, because story is ALL this game has going for it! Your interaction and gameplay is limited to walking around investigating the environment for \""clues\"" and QTEs\, Heavy Rain style. The choices you make\, per usual for games like this\, don't branch the plot nearly as much as advertised.The sound design is only passable\, and the acting is pretty cheesy and annoying\, not helped by the terrible writing. About the only thing this game has going for it is the graphics\, which are fairly impressive for a PS4 game\, but the Uncanny Valley character models and occasional half-assed textures undercut the game on that front as well. Plus the framerate is unsteady\, a disappointment for people used to other Sony efforts like Uncharted which are much more polished by comparison.Bottom line\, this game is over-hyped garbage\, one of the worst turds to be produced by the \""cinematic game\"" movement yet. The fact that it's reviewed so well just shows how bad gaming \""journalism\"" and people's taste in horror games have become. It's not a good horror game\, it's not a good story\, and it's just plain not good. If you have some friends who are willing to chip in for a cheap copy and riff it with you\, that's the only time I would recommend buying it\, and even that's a hesitant recommendation.… Expand",true

Visually\, this game is beautiful. Even though it's set entirely at night\, it still looks great. You take control of several teenages who have returned to the location where 2 of their friends went missing the previous year for some sort of closure\, but unfortunately for them things get stranger and darker... I did enjoy this game a lot\, but I felt that the end was a bit rushed and the amount of QTE's made some of the more suspensful scenes feel too regimented and in turn\, less suspensful. If it allowed me to climb up walls within the caves myself\, or run and jump/crawl in real time\, rather than pressing X or Y when prompted\, I think I'd would've felt a lot more immersed. On top of this\, the game relied far too much on replaying the game to try and discover certain clues regarding the background of the characters and area you're in. This meant that by the time I finished the game there were a lot of unanswered questions and I didn't feel an urge to play through it all again. Overall\, Until Dawn is a good game and definitely worth playing if you're a fan of puzzle and horror games.… Expand",true

It is an unfolding story that you move your character through\, like watching a film that you're taking an active part in. You have to make decisions as you go\, often having to make choices very quickly and under pressure. It's really well done\, it looks gorgeous\, and although it took me a few minutes to get the hang of moving my character almost out of sight until the camera angle changed\, I did\, and it all works pretty seamlessly. The acting and characterization is excellent\, I found it very atmospheric\, and I was completely engrossed and intrigued to see where the story was heading. I didn't find it terrifying\, more moderately creepy with some real 'scream out loud' moments that made me laugh afterwards. It wasn't very long but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it and will definitely be playing it through again to try some different choices. Worth every penny I spent on it and then some.… Expand",true
